        fabio:abstract     "Artemisinin is used as an antimalarial and anticancer agent with minimal toxic effects on the host body. Biotin-PEG-PCL polymers have been used for targeted drug delivery to cancer, as well as to improve the pharmacokinetics of the drug and reduce its effects. In this study, biotin-conjugated copolymers were fabricated with polymerization of the ring opening method and the properties of copolymer and nanoparticles were investigated using various techniques. The toxicity of artemisinin and its nanoparticles have been investigated on MCF-7 and normal HFF2 cells. The results showed that the encapsulation efficacy of artemisinin in nanoparticles was 45.5 ± 0.41%. The release profile of the drug indicates that the release is slow and controlled and is approximately pH dependent. The results of artemisinin cell culture on human breast cancer cells showed that biotin-PEG-PCL nanoparticles had an inhibitory effect on MCF-7 cells and had no toxic effects on HFF2 cells. Anticancer activity in vivo in the 4T1 breast cancer model showed that tumour volumes were decreased up 40 mm3 by ART-loaded micelles and 76 mm3 by free ART, compared to the control group (2150 mm). In vivo results showed that this formulation significantly increases the accumulation of substances in the tumours. Therefore, the molecular formulation of ART-based copolymers can be a desirable process for cancer treatment purposes. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group." ;

It has been estimated that there are about 2 billion people with a serological profile of HBV infection, and 360 million patients worldwide living with chronic HBV-associated liver disease, hence the need to find an efficient and precise diagnosis technique to drive a robust treatment for Hepatitis B virus cannot be over emphasized. The emergence of analytical device like biosensor which combines biological and physicochemical element to detect HBV in screened samples has been very helpful in providing a timely intervention to tame this virus. This review focuses on the current state of biosensor researches with respect to various in-depth application of gold nanoparticle for the detection of HBV. © 2019 The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "n-Butylidenephthalide (BP) is a potential anti-cancer drug, which can be extracted from Angelica sinensis (Danggui). Previous reports have shown the effectiveness of BP in treating cancer diseases. However, BP has no targeting capacity towards specific cancer cells. To improve treatment efficiency and reduce the dose of BP used in cancer treatment, targeting-based approaches should be developed. In the present study, we used riboflavin-5′-phosphate (RFMP) immobilized iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4 MNPs) as carriers for BP to treat cancer cell lines derived from liver, prostate and breast. These model cancer cells overexpress riboflavin receptors on their cell membrane and are also sensitive to BP treatment. Thus, BP-binding free RFMP on MNPs can be used as probes to target these model cells, whereas BP can be readily released on target cancer cells. Cell viability was twofold lower by using Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs immobilized with BP than that achieved by using free-form BP at a similar amount. Moreover, BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs have no apparent harmful effects on non-target cells. In addition, we evaluated the level of cysteine-aspartic acid protease 3 (caspase 3) in the resultant cell lysate obtained after treatment by BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs to demonstrate that apoptosis is mainly involved in the growth inhibition of target cells. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

        fabio:abstract    "It is unknown whether the presence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) affects the incidence of laryngeal cancer. The aim of this national population-based retrospective study was to analyze the relationship between MetS and the incidence of laryngeal cancer. Patients with laryngeal cancer (ICD-10: C32) between 2009 and 2010 were retrospectively identified and tracked until 2015 using the Korean Health Insurance claims database. During the seven-year follow-up period, 5,322 subjects were newly diagnosed with larynx cancer. The mean age of people with laryngeal cancer was much higher than those without (63.29 vs. 47.7 years, p < 0.0001), and the incidence of larynx cancer in men was much higher than that in women (93.16% vs. 6.84%, p < 0.0001). Age, gender, smoking status, alcohol intake, and exercise-adjusted hazard ratios indicated that participants with MetS had a 1.13-fold higher hazard of having larynx cancer than those without MetS. The number of MetS components was a strong risk factor for laryngeal cancer with a higher risk estimate of this cancer in both ex- and current smokers as well as people who have never smoked. MetS was found to be an independent risk factor for the incidence of laryngeal cancer. In Korea, MetS and its components are significantly associated with the development of laryngeal cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

In this study, we demonstrated that FLOT2 expression levels were greatly upregulated in glioma tissues and cell lines, and the FLOT2 expression in glioma tissue was markedly associated with tumour stage and size. Overexpression of FLOT2 was correlated with poor prognosis of glioma patients. The functional assay revealed that silenced FLOT2 repressed the viability, migration, and invasion of glioma cells. And then, we detected the relationship between miR-449 and FLOT2. Luciferase reporter assay and Western blot results showed that miR-449 directly binding the 3′UTR sequence of FLOT2 and regulated FLOT2 expression in glioma cells. Finally, we detected the expression levels of miR-449 in glioma tissue and cell lines and found that miR-449 was significantly downregulated in glioma tissues and cell lines. In conclusion, we demonstrated that overexpression FLOT2 was associated with poor prognosis of glioma patients and involved in the progression of glioma, identifying a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for glioma progression. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Chromosome changes are one of the hallmarks of human malignancies. Chromosomal rearrangement is frequent in human cancers. One of the consequences of chromosomal rearrangement is gene fusions in the cancer genome. We have previously identified a panel of fusion genes in aggressive prostate cancers. In this study, we showed that 6 of these fusion genes are present in 7 different types of human malignancies with variable frequencies. Among them, the CCNH-C5orf30 and TRMT11-GRIK2 gene fusions were found in breast cancer, colon cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, ovarian cancer and liver cancer, with frequencies ranging from 12.9% to 85%. In contrast, four other gene fusions (mTOR-TP53BP1, TMEM135-CCDC67, KDM4-AC011523.2 and LRRC59-FLJ60017) are less frequent. Both TRMT11-GRIK2 and CCNH-C5orf30 are also frequently present in lymph node metastatic cancer samples from the breast, colon and ovary. Thus, detecting these fusion transcripts may have significant biological and clinical implications in cancer patient management. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Quantifying the genetic correlation between cancers can provide important insights into the mechanisms driving cancer etiology. Using genome-wide association study summary statistics across six cancer types based on a total of 296,215 cases and 301,319 controls of European ancestry, here we estimate the pair-wise genetic correlations between breast, colorectal, head/neck, lung, ovary and prostate cancer, and between cancers and 38 other diseases. We observed statistically significant genetic correlations between lung and head/neck cancer (r g = 0.57, p = 4.6 × 10 −8 ), breast and ovarian cancer (r g = 0.24, p = 7 × 10 −5 ), breast and lung cancer (r g = 0.18, p =1.5 × 10 −6 ) and breast and colorectal cancer (r g = 0.15, p = 1.1 × 10 −4 ). We also found that multiple cancers are genetically correlated with non-cancer traits including smoking, psychiatric diseases and metabolic characteristics. Functional enrichment analysis revealed a significant excess contribution of conserved and regulatory regions to cancer heritability. Our comprehensive analysis of cross-cancer heritability suggests that solid tumors arising across tissues share in part a common germline genetic basis. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Purpose: Several previous studies have shown that oral bisphosphonates (BPs) are associated with the incidence of 13 specific cancers, including lung cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the findings are heterogeneous. Methods and results: Relevant studies published in databases such as PubMed, Embase database, and Cochrane library were systematically retrieved from inception to August 25th, 2018, regardless of language, by two investigators independently. Afterwards, the maximum adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted from the retrieved studies. Finally, 13 cohort studies involving 1,510,763 participants were enrolled into this meta-analysis. No significant relationship was found between oral BPs and the risk of all-cause cancer in osteoporosis (OP) patients among the entire population (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80–1.18; I 2 92.5%). Besides, oral BPs could remarkably reduce the incidence of breast cancer (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68–0.92; I 2 54%) and endometrial cancer (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64–0.96; I 2 0%) in postmenopausal OP females. In addition, oral BPs were also found to evidently reduce the incidence of upper gastrointestinal cancer in OP patients among the entire population (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54–0.98; I 2 36.1%). However, oral BPs may lead to increased risk of liver cancer in mixed genders (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.03–2.77; I 2 30.7%). Conclusions: Taken together, oral BPs do not increase the risk of incidence of all-cause cancer; instead, they can reduce the incidence of breast, endometrial, and upper gastrointestinal cancers among the postmenopausal OP females. Our analysis stratified by gender suggests that oral BPs may increase the incidence of liver cancer in mixed genders, while no significant association was observed in females. Careful analysis of post-marketing data should be conducted to address the clinical relevance of our results on the putative association of oral BP use and liver cancer suggested by our meta-analysis. © 2018, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play critical roles in the tumor progression. However, it remains unclear how cancer cells migrate in the three-dimensional (3D) matrix of cancer tissues and how CAFs support the cancer invasion. Here we propose a novel mechanism of fibroblast-dependent cancer cell invasion in the 3D collagen matrix. Human cancer cell lines from the pancreas (Panc-1), lung (A549) and some other organs actively adhered to normal fibroblasts and primary lung CAFs in cultures. To show its significance in tumor invasion, we designed a new invasion assay in which homogeneous microspheroids consisting of cancer cells and fibroblasts were embedded into collagen gel. Time-lapse experiments showed that cancer cells adhered to and quickly migrated on the long protrusions of fibroblasts in the 3D collagen matrix. Fibroblast-free cancer cells poorly invaded the matrix. Experiments with function-blocking antibodies, siRNAs, and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that cancer cells adhered to fibroblasts through integrin α5β1-mediated binding to fibronectin on the surface of fibroblasts. Immunochemical analyses of the co-cultures and lung cancers suggested that cancer cells could acquire the migratory force by the fibronectin/integrin signaling. Our results also revealed that the fibroblast-bound fibronectin was a preferential substrate for cancer cells to migrate in the collagen matrix. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The prognosis of pancreatic cancer remains dismal despite continuous and considerable efforts. Integrins (ITGs) are highly expressed in various malignant cancers. However, very few studies investigated the role of integrin α3 (ITGα3) in malignant cancers. Here, we determined the functional role of ITGα3 in pancreatic cancer. Analysis of public microarray databases and Western blot analysis indicated a unique expression of ITGα3 in human pancreatic cancer. Silencing ITGα3 expression significantly inhibited the viability and migration of human pancreatic cancer cells. Notably, ablation of ITGα3 expression resulted in a significant decrease of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression compared with transfection of control-siRNA through an increased number of leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domain protein 1 (LRIG1) expression. In addition, ablating ITGα3 inhibited tumour growth via blockade of EGFR signalling in vivo. Furthermore, the highly expressed ITGα3 led to a poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. Our results provide novel insights into ITGα3-induced aggressive pancreatic cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Breast cancer metastasis accounts for most of the deaths from breast cancer. Since epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in promoting metastasis of cancer, many mechanisms regarding EMT have been studied. We previously showed that Ribonucleic acid export 1 (RAE1) is dysregulated in breast cancer and its overexpression leads to aggressive breast cancer phenotypes by inducing EMT. Here, we evaluated the functional capacity of RAE1 in breast cancer metastasis by using a three-dimensional (3D) culture system and xenograft models. Furthermore, to investigate the mechanisms of RAE1-driven EMT, in vitro studies were carried out. The induction of EMT with RAE1-overexpression was confirmed under the 3D culture system and in vivo system. Importantly, RAE1 mediates upregulation of an EMT marker ZEB1, by binding to the promoter region of ZEB1. Knockdown of ZEB1 in RAE1-overexpressing cells suppressed invasive and migratory behaviors, accompanied by an increase in epithelial and a decrease in mesenchymal markers. Taken together, these data demonstrate that RAE1 contributes to breast cancer metastasis by regulating a key EMT-inducing factor ZEB1 expression, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Obesity is a risk factor for many cancers including breast, esophageal, colon, and thyroid cancer. We aimed to evaluate the association of thyroid cancer with body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and weight change. This nationwide population-based cohort study included 11,323,006 adults who joined the national health screening program. Weight change was defined as the difference between the weight of the subjects measured during the study period and the weight at the time of four years ago. For evaluating the association between the weight change and the risk of thyroid cancer, subjects without weight change for four years were defined as the reference group. Mean age was 50.1 ± 13.7 years and 44% were female. In total, 50,464 subjects (0.4%) had newly-diagnosed thyroid cancer. After multivariable analyses, the incidence of thyroid cancer increased significantly in subjects with larger WC as well as higher BMI (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). In subjects who were lean and became obese, the incidence of thyroid cancers increased significantly (hazard ratio [HR] 1.15 [1.11–1.19]). In subjects who were obese and became lean, the incidence of thyroid cancers decreased significantly (HR 0.89 [0.86–0.93]). These results demonstrated that higher BMI and larger WC were significantly associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer. Weight gain in lean subjects was associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer, and weight reduction in subjects with obesity was associated with a decreased risk of thyroid cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) has increased among Norwegian women, and is among the highest in the world. In order to understand this increase, country specific dietary exposures have been investigated. The aim of this study was to quantify the association between consumption of brown cheese, a common bread topping in Norway, and colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer in the prospective Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) Study. Data on brown cheese consumption and adjustment factors was available for 82 527 women. During a mean of 14.6 years of follow-up (1.2 million person-years), there were 1360 cases of colorectal cancer (907 colon; 453 rectal). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer sites. We modelled restricted cubic splines with 4 knots, to assess a possible non-linear relationship between brown cheese intake and the investigated cancer sites. In the age-adjusted model, consumption of more than 2 slices (>16 grams) of brown cheese per day was associated with 13% reduced risk of colon cancer (95% CI 4%-21%) compared to women who did not consume brown cheese. The multivariable-adjusted model, however, showed no association between brown cheese consumption and the risk of colorectal, colon, or rectal cancer (colorectal: HR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.76–1.13, p-trend 0.37; colon: HR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.65–1.06; p-trend = 0.10; rectal: HR = 1.16, 95% CI 0.84–1.1.61, p-trend = 0.41). In this large, prospective cohort study of women, consumption of brown cheese was suggestively protective against colon cancer. However, adjustment attenuated the inverse risk association. Brown cheese consumption was not associated with rectal cancer, or colorectal cancer overall. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Current cancer diagnosis utilizes histopathology, which requires tissue acquisition, extensive processing and, in most cases, relies on the qualitative morphological analysis of tissues and cells. Molecular biomarkers are only available for a few specific tumor subtypes. We discovered that the fluorescence polarization (Fpol) of Methylene Blue (MB) is significantly higher in cancer than in normal human breast tissues and cells. We confirmed that fluorescence polarization imaging did not affect the viability of the cells and yielded highly significant differences between cancer and normal cells using MB concentrations as low as 0.05 and 0.01 mg/ml. To explain this phenomenon we examined intracellular localization of MB and its fluorescence lifetime. We determined that higher fluorescence polarization of MB occurs due to its increased accumulation in mitochondria of cancer cells, as well as shorter fluorescence lifetime in cancer relative to normal cells. As quantitative MB Fpol imaging can be performed in vivo and in real time, it holds the potential to provide an accurate quantitative marker of cancer at the cellular level. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

However, the specific combinations of mutations responsible for the vast majority of cancers have not been identified. Current computational approaches focus on identifying driver genes and mutations. Although individually these mutations can increase the risk of cancer they do not result in cancer without additional mutations. We present a fundamentally different approach for identifying the cause of individual instances of cancer: we search for combinations of genes with carcinogenic mutations (multi-hit combinations) instead of individual driver genes or mutations. We developed an algorithm that identified a set of multi-hit combinations that differentiate between tumor and normal tissue samples with 91% sensitivity (95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 89–92%) and 93% specificity (95% CI = 91–94%) on average for seventeen cancer types. We then present an approach based on mutational profile that can be used to distinguish between driver and passenger mutations within these genes. These combinations, with experimental validation, can aid in better diagnosis, provide insights into the etiology of cancer, and provide a rational basis for designing targeted combination therapies. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

We developed a novel computational platform applying a multi-modal approach to filter out passengers and more robustly identify putative driver genes. The primary filter identifies enrichment of cancer mutations in CATH functional families (CATH-FunFams) – structurally and functionally coherent sets of evolutionary related domains. Using structural representatives from CATH-FunFams, we subsequently seek enrichment of mutations in 3D and show that these mutation clusters have a very significant tendency to lie close to known functional sites or conserved sites predicted using CATH-FunFams. Our third filter identifies enrichment of putative driver genes in functionally coherent protein network modules confirmed by literature analysis to be cancer associated. Our approach is complementary to other domain enrichment approaches exploiting Pfam families, but benefits from more functionally coherent groupings of domains. Using a set of mutations from 22 cancers we detect 151 putative cancer drivers, of which 79 are not listed in cancer resources and include recently validated cancer associated genes EPHA7, DCC netrin-1 receptor and zinc-finger protein ZNF479. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Collectively, 86.3% (63/73) of HAMPs have recurrent alterations in at least 1 cancer type and 16 HAMPs, including 9 understudied HAMPs, are identified as putative therapeutic targets across multiple cancer types. For example, the recurrent focal amplification of BRD9 is observed in 9 cancer types and genetic depletion of BRD9 inhibits tumor growth.

        fabio:abstract    "The current system for evaluating prostate cancer architecture is the Gleason grading system which divides the morphology of cancer into five distinct architectural patterns, labeled 1 to 5 in increasing levels of cancer aggressiveness, and generates a score by summing the labels of the two most dominant patterns. The Gleason score is currently the most powerful prognostic predictor of patient outcomes; however, it suffers from problems in reproducibility and consistency due to the high intra-observer and inter-observer variability amongst pathologists. In addition, the Gleason system lacks the granularity to address potentially prognostic architectural features beyond Gleason patterns. We evaluate prostate cancer for architectural subtypes using techniques from topological data analysis applied to prostate cancer glandular architecture. In this work we demonstrate the use of persistent homology to capture architectural features independently of Gleason patterns. Specifically, using persistent homology, we compute topological representations of purely graded prostate cancer histopathology images of Gleason patterns 3,4 and 5, and show that persistent homology is capable of clustering prostate cancer histology into architectural groups through a ranked persistence vector. Our results indicate the ability of persistent homology to cluster prostate cancer histopathology images into unique groups with dominant architectural patterns consistent with the continuum of Gleason patterns. In addition, of particular interest, is the sensitivity of persistent homology to identify specific sub-architectural groups within single Gleason patterns, suggesting that persistent homology could represent a robust quantification method for prostate cancer architecture with higher granularity than the existing semi-quantitative measures. The capability of these topological representations to segregate prostate cancer by architecture makes them an ideal candidate for use as inputs to future machine learning approaches with the intent of augmenting traditional approaches with topological features for improved diagnosis and prognosis. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Among 8,651,569 cancer patients, 13,311 committed suicide; the rate of suicide was 28.58/ 100,000-person years, and the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of suicide was 4.44 (95% CI, 4.33, 4.55). The predominant patients who committed suicide were male (83%) and white (92%). Cancers of the lung, head and neck, testes, bladder, and Hodgkin lymphoma had the highest SMRs (> 5-10) through the follow up period. Elderly, white, unmarried males with localized disease are at highest risk vs other cancer patients. Among those diagnosed at < 50 years of age, the plurality of suicides is from hematologic and testicular tumors; if > 50, from prostate, lung, and colorectal cancer patients. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

However, the specific combinations of mutations responsible for the vast majority of cancers have not been identified. Current computational approaches focus on identifying driver genes and mutations. Although individually these mutations can increase the risk of cancer they do not result in cancer without additional mutations. We present a fundamentally different approach for identifying the cause of individual instances of cancer: we search for combinations of genes with carcinogenic mutations (multi-hit combinations) instead of individual driver genes or mutations. We developed an algorithm that identified a set of multi-hit combinations that differentiate between tumor and normal tissue samples with 91% sensitivity (95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 89–92%) and 93% specificity (95% CI = 91–94%) on average for seventeen cancer types. We then present an approach based on mutational profile that can be used to distinguish between driver and passenger mutations within these genes. These combinations, with experimental validation, can aid in better diagnosis, provide insights into the etiology of cancer, and provide a rational basis for designing targeted combination therapies. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The UHRF1-DNMT1 axis plays a key role in DNA maintenance methylation in mammals. Accumulative studies demonstrate that UHRF1 is broadly overexpressed in cancers, which contributes to cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Interestingly, a proteasome-dependent downregulation of UHRF1 has been observed in pluripotent ground state mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) cultured in the presence of two kinase (MEK1/MEK2 and GSK3β) inhibitors (termed 2i), raising the question whether UHRF1 is similarly regulated in cancer cells. Here we present evidence that while addition of 2i broadly downregulates UHRF1 and DNMT1 in various cancer cells, distinct underlying mechanisms are involved. In contrast to mESCs, 2i-induced downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in cancer cells cannot be rescued by proteasome inhibitor and occurs primarily at the level of transcription. Furthermore, downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 by 2i is due to inhibition of MEK1/MEK2, but not GSK3β activity. Data mining reveals a marked co-expression of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in normal tissues as well as cancers. We provide evidence that multiple transcription factors including E2F1 and SP1 mediate the transcriptional activation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 by the activated MEK/ERK pathway. Together our study reveals distinct regulation of UHRF1/DNMT1 in mESCs and cancer cells and identifies activated MEK/ERK pathway as a driving force for coordinated and aberrant over-expression of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in cancers. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

When it is applied to cancer cells, solid stress hinders their proliferation rate and promotes cancer cell invasion and metastatic potential. However, the underlying mechanisms of how it is implicated in cancer metastasis is not yet fully understood. Here, we used two pancreatic cancer cell lines and an established in vitro system to study the effect of solid stress-induced signal transduction on pancreatic cancer cell migration as well as the mechanism involved. Our results show that the migratory ability of cells increases as a direct response to solid stress. We also found that Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) expression and secretion is strongly upregulated in pancreatic cancer cells in response to mechanical compression. Performing a phosphoprotein screening, we identified that solid stress activates the Akt/CREB1 pathway to transcriptionally regulate GDF15 expression, which eventually promotes pancreatic cancer cell migration. Our results suggest a novel solid stress signal transduction mechanism bringing GDF15 to the centre of pancreatic tumor biology and rendering it a potential target for future anti-metastatic therapeutic innovations. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a cancer treatment that make use of the cancer-specific accumulation of porphyrins. We have reported that mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mitROS) upregulate uptake transporter of porphyrins, heme carrier protein-1 (HCP-1). The accumulation of cancer-specific porphyrins was increased by mitROS production, thereby the cancer-specific PDT cytotoxicity was enhanced. Thus we investigated whether mitROS production by hyperthermia can enhanced the cytotoxicity of PDT or not. In this study, 1 h of hyperthermia at 42 °C increased the mitROS production, and both the accumulation of cancer-specific porphyrins and the PDT cytotoxicity increased. Moreover, the authors treated cells with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) to examine the effect of mitROS. NAC inhibited the increasing ROS production after hyperthermia to restrain the post-treatment increase of cancer-specific porphyrins accumulation. Moreover, the increase of ROS production in cancer cells after hyperthermia upregulated HCP-1 expression and downregulated ABCG2 expression. These regulation were inhibited by NAC. These results suggest that hyperthermia treatment increased mitROS production, which involved HpD accumulation and enhanced PDT effects in cancer cells. The mechanism of this phenomenon was most likely to be due to both the upregulation of HCP-1 and the downregulation of ABCG2 by mitROS. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

In this study, we assessed the relationship between breast cancer and cadaverine biosynthesis. Cadaverine treatment of Balb/c female mice (500 nmol/kg p.o. q.d.) grafted with 4T1 breast cancer cells ameliorated the disease (lower mass and infiltration of the primary tumor, fewer metastases, and lower grade tumors). Cadaverine treatment of breast cancer cell lines corresponding to its serum reference range (100–800 nM) reverted endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, inhibited cellular movement and invasion, moreover, rendered cells less stem cell-like through reducing mitochondrial oxidation. Trace amino acid receptors (TAARs), namely, TAAR1, TAAR8 and TAAR9 were instrumental in provoking the cadaverine-evoked effects. Early stage breast cancer patients, versus control women, had reduced abundance of the CadA and LdcC genes in fecal DNA, both responsible for bacterial cadaverine production. Moreover, we found low protein expression of E. coli LdcC in the feces of stage 1 breast cancer patients. In addition, higher expression of lysine decarboxylase resulted in a prolonged survival among early-stage breast cancer patients. Taken together, cadaverine production seems to be a regulator of early breast cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Exogenous overexpression of CBX6 inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation, and induced cell cycle arrest along with suppression of migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro. Microarray analyses revealed that CBX6 governs a complex gene expression program. Moreover, CBX6 induced significant downregulation of bone marrow stromal cell antigen-2 (BST2), a potential therapeutic target, via interactions with its promoter region.

        fabio:abstract    "MRI plays important roles in endometrial and cervical cancer assessment, from detection to recurrent disease evaluation. Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common malignant tumor of the female genital tract in Western countries. EC patients are divided into risk categories based on histopathological tumor type, grade, and myometrial invasion depth. EC is surgically staged using the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) system. Since FIGO (2009) stage correlates with prognosis, preoperative staging is essential for tailored treatment. MRI reveals myometrial invasion depth, which correlates with tumor grade and lymph node metastases, and thus correlates with prognosis. Cervical cancer (CC) is the second most common cancer, and the third leading cause of cancer-related death among females in developing countries. The FIGO Gynecologic Oncology Committee recently revised its CC staging guidelines, allowing staging based on imaging and pathological findings when available. The revised FIGO (2018) staging includes node involvement and thus enables both therapy selection and evaluation, prognosis estimation, and calculation of end results. MRI can accurately assess prognostic indicators, e.g., tumor size, parametrial invasion, pelvic sidewall, and lymph node invasion. Despite these important roles of MRI, radiologists still face challenges due to the technical and interpretation pitfalls of MRI during all phases of endometrial and cervical cancer evaluation. Awareness of mimics that can simulate both cancers is critical. With careful application, functional MRI with DWI and DCE sequences can help establish a correct diagnosis, although it is sometimes necessary to perform biopsy and histopathological analysis. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Our observations were confirmed in a large variety of solid and haematological malignancies. This test was able to detect dysplasia and carcinomas in situ lesions in different organs and circulating factors in cancer patients years after the removal of their lesions. To our knowledge, this ability is unique and not shared by other liquid biopsy platforms. Immunohistochemistry analysis of the xenotransplants revealed identical patterns of differentiation regardless of the cancer type, showing that differentiation through horizontal transfer might be dependent on the nature of the target cells rather than the type of cancer factors.

Various studies have shown the significance of identifying drug targets for cancer, although this process continues challenging in the field of anti-cancer drug designing. The primary purpose of this study is to design a novel approach to identify target genes for cancer. The sub-network of colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancers were constructed from human protein–protein interaction network. The potential genes were analyzed using hubs and centrality measures. For the identification of target genes, we retrieve those genes that had the highest score in both mutation rates and graph centrality. Moreover, gene deletion analysis revealed that MYC, TP53, and EGFR genes remained potential targets in colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancer respectively. Results suggest that combining network measures with mutation frequencies in cancer genes might assist in recognizing several potential drug targets. Future enhancement of this current approach is to combine these network properties with the biological insights from gene expression data, and their functions will provide a reliable method for rational drug designing. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature." ;

As extracellular matrix, glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) could bind its surface receptor adhesion molecule CD44 which is strongly expressed on breast cancer. We have previously reported a doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded HA-Lys-LA X-NPs (X-NP-DOX) NP delivery system for breast cancer treatment. In this study, we further investigated the antitumor effect of X-NP-DOX NP delivery system using low-dose DOX in both in vitro and in vivo systems. We demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX possessed the ability for inhibiting MCF-7 breast cancer cell growth, invasion, and migration, and inducing apoptosis in vitro. In in vivo experiments, injection of low-dose X-NP-DOX into tumor-bearing mouse resulted in significant reduction of tumor size. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining further revealed that low-dose X-NP-DOX induced higher percentage of apoptotic cells compared with free DOX or saline. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX inhibited Notch1 and Ras/MAPK pathways, decreased cancer stem cell population, and reduced tumorigenesis compared to free DOX in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Owing to its enhanced efficacy and higher targetability compared to free DOX, low-dose DOX delivered by NP system may be a promising novel strategy for breast cancer treatment." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Breast cancer survivors display altered inflammatory responses to immune challenges relative to cancer-naive controls likely due to previous cancer treatments, stress associated with cancer, and/or tumor physiology. Proper inflammatory responses are necessary for adaptive sickness behaviors (e.g., fatigue, anorexia, and fever) and neuroinflammatory pathways are also implicated in mental health disturbances (e.g., cognitive impairment, depression) suffered by cancer patients and survivors. Rodent cancer models indicate that tumors are sufficient to exacerbate neuroinflammatory responses after an immune challenge, however primary tumors are not usually present in cancer survivors, and the behavioral consequences of these brain changes remain understudied. Therefore, we tested the extent to which mammary tumor resection attenuates tumor-induced neuroinflammation and sickness behavior following an immune challenge (i.p. lipopolysaccharide [LPS] injection) in mice. Tnf-α, Il-1β, and Il-6 mRNA decreased in multiple brain regions of LPS-treated tumor-bearing mice relative to LPS-treated controls; tumor resection attenuated these effects in some cases (but not Tnf-α). Tumors also attenuated sickness behaviors (hypothermia and lethargy) compared to LPS-treated controls. Tumor resection reversed these behavioral consequences, although basal body temperature remained elevated, comparable to tumor-bearing mice. Thus, tumors significantly modulate neuroinflammatory pathways with functional consequences and tumor resection mitigates most, but not all, of these changes. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Although substantial advances have been obtained both in treatment and survival rates, there is still a need for new therapeutical approaches. Natural compounds are a realistic source of new bioactive compounds with anticancer activity. Among them, rosemary polyphenols have shown a vast antiproliferative capacity against colon cancer cells in vitro and in animal models. We have investigated the antitumor activity of a rosemary extract (RE) obtained by using supercritical fluid extraction through its capacity to inhibit various signatures of cancer progression and metastasis such as proliferation, migration, invasion and clonogenic survival. RE strongly inhibited proliferation, migration and colony formation of colon cancer cells regardless their phenotype. Treatment with RE led to a sharp increase of intracellular ROS that resulted in necrosis cell death. Nrf2 gene silencing increased RE cytotoxic effects, thus suggesting that this pathway was involved in cell survival. These in vitro results were in line with a reduction of tumor growth by oral administration of RE in a xenograft model of colon cancer cells using athymic nude mice. These findings indicate that targeting colon cancer cells by increasing intracellular ROS and decreasing cell survival mechanisms may suppose a therapeutic option in colon cancer through the combination of rosemary compounds and chemotherapeutic drugs. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Although cure rates are high for early stage disease, clinical outcomes for advanced, metastatic, or recurrent disease remain poor. To change this panorama, a deeper understanding of cervical cancer biology and novel study models are needed. Immortalized human cancer cell lines such as HeLa constitute crucial scientific tools, but there are few other cervical cancer cell lines available, limiting our understanding of a disease known for its molecular heterogeneity. This study aimed to establish novel cervical cancer cell lines derived from Brazilian patients. We successfully established one (HCB-514) out of 35 cervical tumors biopsied. We confirmed the phenotype of HCB-514 by verifying its’ epithelial and tumor origin through cytokeratins, EpCAM and p16 staining. It was also HPV-16 positive. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) showed relevant somatic mutations in several genes including BRCA2, TGFBR1 and IRX2. A copy number variation (CNV) analysis by nanostring and WES revealed amplification of genes mainly related to kinases proteins involved in proliferation, migration and cell differentiation, such as EGFR, PIK3CA, and MAPK7. Overexpression of EGFR was confirmed by phospho RTK-array and validated by western blot analysis. Furthermore, the HCB-514 cell line was sensitive to cisplatin. In summary, this novel Brazilian cervical cancer cell line exhibits relevant key molecular features and constitutes a new biological model for pre-clinical studies. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

To determine how cancer cells adapt to RS, we have monitored the expression of different components of the ATR-CHK1 pathway in primary tumor samples. We show that unlike upstream components of the pathway, the checkpoint mediators Claspin and Timeless are overexpressed in a coordinated manner. Remarkably, reducing the levels of Claspin and Timeless in HCT116 cells to pretumoral levels impeded fork progression without affecting checkpoint signaling. These data indicate that high level of Claspin and Timeless increase RS tolerance by protecting replication forks in cancer cells. Moreover, we report that primary fibroblasts adapt to oncogene-induced RS by spontaneously overexpressing Claspin and Timeless, independently of ATR signaling. Altogether, these data indicate that enhanced levels of Claspin and Timeless represent a gain of function that protects cancer cells from of oncogene-induced RS in a checkpoint-independent manner. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Curcumin, the active polyphenol from turmeric, helps to obstruct the growth of many types of cancers at various stages which include prostrate, melanoma, breast, brain tumor, pancreatic, leukemia, etc. The initiation and recurrence of cancer have been attributed to few mutated cells in bulk of tumor called as cancer stem cells which have the capacity of self-renewal and differentiation. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3B) is a multifunctional serine/threonine protein kinase, originally found in mammals, an important component of diverse signaling pathways, dysregulation of which leads to affect the cancer stem cell properties. The nutritional- and phytochemical-based dietary interventions may complement current chemotherapy to prevent recurrence and relapse of cancer. The objective of present study is to investigate the effect of retinoic acid and curcumin–retinoic acid conjugates against GSK-3B protein.

Endometrial cancers are associated with several critical gene mutations, including PIK3A, PTEN, and KRAS. Different gene mutations in endometrial cancer cells have varied responses to anticancer drugs and cancer therapies. The most frequently altered gene in endometrioid endometrial carcinoma tumors is PTEN. PTEN protein has lipid phosphatase and protein phosphatase activity, as well as other functions in the nucleus. Although the tumor-suppressive function of PTEN has mainly been attributed to its lipid phosphatase activity, a role for PTEN protein phosphatase activity in cell cycle regulation has also been suggested. Various tumor type-specific PTEN mutations are well documented. Here, nine endometrioid endometrial cancer cell lines with PIK3A, PTEN, and KRAS gene mutations were treated with docetaxel and radiation. One mutation with a docetaxel drug-resistant effect was a truncated form of PTEN. Among PTEN mutations in endometrial cancer cells, the Y68 frame shift mutation of PTEN constitutes a major mechanism of resistance to docetaxel treatment. The molecular mechanism involves truncation of the 403 amino acid PTEN protein at amino acid 68 by the Y68 frame shift, leading to the loss of PTEN protein phosphatase and lipid phosphatase activities. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

The present review comprehends the stimuli-responsive polymers and multi-responsiveness with respect to cancer therapy. It focuses on the exploitation of different stimuli like temperature, pH and enzymes responsiveness in a multi-stimuli setting. Nanogels and micelles being two of the most commonly used responsive polymeric carriers have also been discussed. The role of multiple stimuli delivery system is significant due to multiple changes happening in the near surroundings of cancer cells.

In contrast, antibodies to BLV were found in a very small percentage of healthy blood donors. There was no association between BLV DNA and other tumor prognostic biological markers such as hormonal receptors, HER2 oncoprotein, proliferation index, metastasis in sentinels lymph nodes, and tumor grade and size. Our findings suggest that BLV should be considered a potential predisposing factor to breast cancer in women. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Copy number loss of PIK3R1 (p85α) most commonly occurs in ovarian cancer among all cancer types. Here we report that ovarian cancer cells manifest a spectrum of tumorigenic phenotypes upon knockdown of PIK3R1. PIK3R1 loss activates AKT and p110-independent JAK2/STAT3 signaling through inducing changes in the phosphorylation of the docking protein Gab2, thereby relieving the negative inhibition on AKT and promoting the assembly of JAK2/STAT3 signalosome, respectively. Additional mechanisms leading to AKT activation include enhanced p110α kinase activity and a decrease in PTEN level. PIK3R1 loss renders ovarian cancer cells vulnerable to inhibition of AKT or JAK2/STAT3. The combination of AKT and STAT3 inhibitors significantly increases the anti-tumor effect compared to single-agent treatments. Together, our findings provide a rationale for mechanism-based therapeutic approach that targets tumors with loss of PIK3R1. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we perform Repli-Seq and integrated epigenome analyses and demonstrate that genomic regions that undergo long-range epigenetic deregulation in prostate cancer also show concordant differences in replication timing. A subset of altered replication timing domains are conserved across cancers from different tissue origins. Notably, late-replicating regions in cancer cells display a loss of DNA methylation, and a switch in heterochromatin features from H3K9me3-marked constitutive to H3K27me3-marked facultative heterochromatin. Finally, analysis of 214 prostate and 35 breast cancer genomes reveal that late-replicating regions are prone to cis and early-replication to trans chromosomal rearrangements. Together, our data suggests that the nature of chromosomal rearrangement in cancer is related to the spatial and temporal positioning and altered epigenetic states of early-replicating compared to late-replicating loci. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are promising therapies for haematological cancers. Historically, their therapeutic benefit is due to ADC targeting of lineage-restricted antigens. The C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is attractive for targeted therapy of haematological cancers, given its expression in multiple tumour types and role in cancer “homing” to bone marrow. However, CXCR4 is also expressed in haematopoietic cells and other normal tissues, raising safety challenges to the development of anti-CXCR4 ADCs for cancer treatment. Here, we designed the first anti-CXCR4 ADC with favourable therapeutic index, effective in xenografts of haematopoietic cancers resistant to standard of care and anti-CXCR4 antibodies. We screened multiple ADC configurations, by varying type of linker-payload, drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR), affinity and Fc format. The optimal ADC bears a non-cleavable linker, auristatin as payload at DAR = 4 and a low affinity antibody with effector–reduced Fc. Contrary to other drugs targeting CXCR4, anti-CXCR4 ADCs effectively eliminated cancer cells as monotherapy, while minimizing leucocytosis. The optimal ADC selectively eliminated CXCR4 + cancer cells in solid tumours, but showed limited toxicity to normal CXCR4 + tissues, sparing haematopoietic stem cells and progenitors. Our work provides proof-of-concept that through empirical ADC design, it is possible to target proteins with broad normal tissue expression. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Cancers in the bone produce a number of severe symptoms including pain that compromises patient functional status, quality of life, and survival. The source of this pain is multifaceted and includes factors secreted from tumor cells. Malignant cells release the neurotransmitter and cell-signaling molecule glutamate via the oxidative stress-related cystine/glutamate antiporter, system x C − , which reciprocally imports cystine for synthesis of glutathione and the cystine/cysteine redox cycle. Pharmacological inhibition of system x C − has shown success in reducing and delaying the onset of cancer pain-related behavior in mouse models. This investigation describes the development of a stable siRNA-induced knockdown of the functional trans-membrane system x C − subunit xCT (SLC7A11) in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Clones were verified for xCT knockdown at the transcript, protein, and functional levels. RNAseq was performed on a representative clone to comprehensively examine the transcriptional cellular signature in response to xCT knockdown, identifying multiple differentially regulated factors relevant to cancer pain including nerve growth factor, interleukin-1, and colony-stimulating factor-1. Mice were inoculated intrafemorally and recordings of pain-related behaviors including weight bearing, mechanical withdrawal, and limb use were performed. Animals implanted with xCT knockdown cancer cells displayed a delay until the onset of nociceptive behaviors relative to control cells. These results add to the body of evidence suggesting that a reduction in glutamate release from cancers in bone by inhibition of the system x C − transporter may decrease the severe and intractable pain associated with bone metastases. © The Author(s) 2019." ;

Method: For finding the related articles, the researchers searched several databases including PubMed &ProQuest and valid websites including ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Scientific Information Database, and Magiran. The key terms of \"reflexology, cancer, and chemotherapy\" individually and combined together were searched in Parisian and English, and the studies performed from 2009 to 2018 were extracted. Due to the lack of sufficient studies carried out into the outcome of reflexology on chemotherapy, both Persian and English articles were used. Results: A total of 57 studies were extracted from the databases and valid websites; five of which met the inclusion criteria. All selected studies were clinical trials. Implications for Practice: Reflexology can be used as a non-pharmacologic nursing intervention to alleviate the side effects of chemotherapy and improve the quality of life of cancer patients. © 2019 Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

For effective evaluation of this strategy it is crucial to identify which patients are suited for CD47-targeted therapy. In this respect, expression of the pro-phagocytic signal SLAMF7 on both macrophages and cancer cells was recently reported to be a requisite for CD47 antibody-mediated phagocytosis. Here, we demonstrate that in fact SLAMF7 expression on cancer cells is not required and does not impact on CD47 antibody therapy. Moreover, SLAMF7 also does not impact on phagocytosis induction by CD20 antibody rituximab nor associates with overall survival of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma patients. In contrast, expression of CD47 negatively impacts on overall and progression free survival. In conclusion, cancer cell expression of SLAMF7 is not required for phagocytosis and, in contrast to CD47 expression, should not be used as selection criterion for CD47-targeted therapy. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Increased Crabp2 levels have been found in various types of cancer, and are associated with poor patients’ survival. Although Crabp2 is found to be overexpressed in lung cancer, its role in metastasis of lung cancer is unclear. In this study, Crabp2 was overexpressed in high-metastatic C10F4 than low-metastatic lung cancer cells. Analysis of clinical samples revealed that high CRABP2 levels were correlated with lymph node metastases, poor overall survival, and increased recurrence. Knockdown of Crabp2 decreased migration, invasion, anoikis resistance, and in vivo metastasis. Crabp2 was co-immunoprecipitated with HuR, and overexpression of Crabp2 increased HuR levels, which promoted integrin β1/FAK/ERK signaling. Inhibition of HuR or integrin β1/FAK/ERK signaling reversed the promoting effect of Crabp2 in migration, invasion, and anoikis resistance. Knockdown of Crabp2 further inhibited the growth of cancer cells as compared with that by gemcitabine or irinotecan alone. The expression of Crabp2 in human lung tumors was correlated with stress marker CHOP. In conclusion, our findings have identified the promoting role of Crabp2 in anoikis resistance and metastasis. CRABP2 may serve as a prognostic marker and targeting CRABP2 may be exploited as a modality to reduce metastasis. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "SPG-56 is a newly isolated glycoprotein from sweet potatoes (Zhongshu NO. 1), but its value for suppressing breast cancer progression remains unknown. This study was designed to investigate the potential anti-cancer effects of SPG-56, which consists of 2.9% sugar and 97.1% protein. The effects of SPG-56 on the proliferation and apoptosis of breast cancer cells were determined using CCK-8 and Hoechst 33342 assays and flow cytometry, after staining with Annexin V and PI respectively. The activities of SPG-56 against breast cancer were examined using female BALB/c nude mice orthotopically implanted with human breast carcinoma cells of the types MCF-7 and 4T1-Luc. The cellular experiments showed that SPG-56 inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of MCF-7 cells dose- and time-dependently. Oral administration of SPG-56 significantly suppressed the development of MCF-7 tumor cells (P < 0.01) as compared with an untreated group. The serum tumor markers CEA, CA125 and CA153 in a 240 mg/kg/d SPG-56 decreased by 54.8%, 91.8%, and 90.3%, respectively. The experiments further demonstrated that SPG-56 inhibited the metastasis of breast cancer in MCF-7 and 4T1-bearing mice by altering the expression of MMP2, MMP9, VEGF, Occludin and Claudin. It is concluded that SPG-56 may have potential as a novel anti-tumor candidate for breast cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Lymph node metastasis is of major prognostic significance for breast cancer. Lymph node metastasis arises at a very early stage in some patients. Using the data downloaded from the TCGA database, we studied the differences between primary tumors with and without lymph node metastasis at the multi-omics level using bioinformatics approaches. Our study found that low mutation and neoantigen burdens correlated with lymph node metastazation of breast cancer. All three conserved domains in TP53 were mutated in lymph node-negative breast cancers, whereas only one domain was mutated in lymph node-positive samples. Mutations in microtubule-related proteins appear to help immune cells recognize tumors and inhibit their lymph node metastasis. Destroying microtubule-related proteins is a potential therapeutic strategy to inhibit lymph node metastasis of breast cancer. As the neoantigens specifically present in lymph node-positive breast cancers, MAPK10, BC9L, TRIM65, CD93, KITLG, CNPPD1, CPED1, CCDC146, TMEM185A, INO80D, and PSMD11 are potential targets for vaccine design. In the tumor microenvironment, reduced numbers of effector immune cells, especially activated memory CD4+ T cells and activated mast cells, facilitate breast cancer metastasis to the lymph nodes. According to transcriptome data, lymph node metastasis was mostly driven by gene mutation rather than by gene expression. Although differential gene expression analysis was based on lymph node metastasis status, many genes were shown to be differentially expressed based on estrogen receptor status. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Fibroblasts turn into cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumour microenvironment. CAFs have recently attracted attention for their function as a regulator of immune cell recruitment and function in addition to their tumour-promoting roles. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of CAFs on monocyte recruitment and macrophage polarization in breast cancer. CAFs, which were α-SMA expressing fibroblasts in contrast to normal fibroblasts (NFs), effectively recruited monocytes. Recruitment of monocytes by CAFs might be mediated by monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) as well as stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) cytokines. CAFs differentiated the recruited monocytes into M2-like macrophages which are capable of exerting their immunosuppressive roles via the PD-1 axis. CAF-educated monocytes exhibited strong immune suppression unlike NF-educated monocytes and enhanced the motility/invasion of breast cancer cells in addition to increasing the expressions of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes and vimentin protein in cancer cells. CAF-educated M1 macrophages displayed increased expression of M2 markers and production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in contrast to decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12 compared with control M1 macrophages; suggesting that CAFs were also able to induce the trans-differentiation of M1 macrophages to M2 macrophages. We then investigated the relationship between the infiltration of CAFs and tumour associated macrophages (TAMs) using tissue samples obtained from breast cancer patients. High grade of CAFs significantly correlated with the number of TAMs in human breast cancer tissue samples. It was also associated with higher Ki-67 proliferation index, and higher tumour volume. This result is in line with our finding of increased breast cancer cell proliferation due to the effects of CAF-educated monocytes in vitro. Our results concluded that CAFs play pivotal roles in sculpturing the tumour microenvironment in breast cancer, and therapeutic strategies to reverse the CAF-mediated immunosuppressive microenvironment should be taken into consideration. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

We construct iCells of four cancers and the corresponding tissue controls and identify the most rewired genes in cancer. Many of them are of unknown function and cannot be identified as different in cancer in any specific molecular network. We biologically validate that they have a role in cancer by knockdown experiments followed by cell viability assays. We find additional support through Kaplan-Meier survival curves of thousands of patients. Finally, we extend this analysis to uncover pan-cancer genes.

The increasing popularity of sequencing technologies motivates the in-silico identification of CCLs based on their mutational fingerprint, but care must be taken when identifying heterogeneous data. We recently developed the proof-of-concept Uniquorn 1 method which could reliably identify heterogeneous sequencing data from selected sequencing technologies. Here we present Uniquorn 2, a generic and robust in-silico identification method for CCLs with DNA/RNA-seq and panel-seq information. We benchmarked Uniquorn 2 by cross-identifying 1612 RNA and 3596 panel-sized NGS profiles derived from 1516 CCLs, five repositories, four technologies and three major cancer panel-designs. Our method achieves an accuracy of 96% for RNA-seq and 95% for mixed DNA-seq and RNA-seq identification. Even for a panel of only 94 cancer-related genes, accuracy remains at 82% but decreases when using smaller panels.

In this ex vivo study of nine fresh human colon specimens, we report the first use of quantified subsurface scattering coefficient maps acquired by swept-source optical coherence tomography to reveal subsurface abnormities. We generate subsurface scattering coefficient maps with a novel wavelet-based-curve-fitting method that provides significantly improved accuracy. The angular spectra of scattering coefficient maps of normal tissues exhibit a spatial feature distinct from those of abnormal tissues. An angular spectrum index to quantify the differences between the normal and abnormal tissues is derived, and its strength in revealing subsurface cancer in ex vivo samples is statistically analyzed. The study demonstrates that the angular spectrum of the scattering coefficient map can effectively reveal subsurface colorectal cancer and potentially provide a fast and more accurate diagnosis. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Current options in palliation such as hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) present severe side effects. Recent research efforts suggested the therapeutic use of oxidant-enriched liquid using cold physical plasma. To investigate a clinically accepted treatment regimen, we assessed the antitumor capacity of plasma-treated saline solution. In response to such liquid, CT26 murine colon cancer cells were readily oxidized and showed cell growth with subsequent apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and upregulation of immunogenic cell death (ICD) markers in vitro. This was accompanied by marked morphological changes with re-arrangement of actin fibers and reduced motility. Induction of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype was not observed. Key results were confirmed in MC38 colon and PDA6606 pancreatic cancer cells. Compared to plasma-treated saline, hydrogen peroxide was inferiorly toxic in 3D tumor spheroids but of similar efficacy in 2D models. In vivo, plasma-treated saline decreased tumor burden in Balb/C mice. This was concomitant with elevated numbers of intratumoral macrophages and increased T cell activation following incubation with CT26 cells ex vivo. Being a potential adjuvant for HIPEC therapy, our results suggest oxidizing saline solutions to inactivate colon cancer cells while potentially stimulating antitumor immune responses. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Although solid fuel combustion emissions are known to increase the prevalence of illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer, however, their effect on the eyes is underexplored. This study assesses the acute toxicity of solid fuel combustion emissions on healthy ocular cells and a cancer cell line. Three healthy ocular cell lines (corneal, lens, and retinal epithelial cells) and a cancer cell line (Chinese hamster ovary cells) were exposed to liquid and gas phase emissions from applewood and coal combustion. Following the exposure, real-time cell attachment behavior was monitored for at least 120 hours with electrical cell impedance spectroscopy. The viability of the cells, amount of apoptotic cells, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were quantified with MTT, ApoTox-Glo, and ROS-Glo H 2 O 2 assays, respectively. The results showed that coal emissions compromised the viability of ocular cells more than applewood emissions. Interestingly, the cancer cells, although their viability was not compromised, generated 1.7 to 2.7 times more ROS than healthy cells. This acute exposure study provides compelling proof that biomass combustion emissions compromise the viability of ocular cells and increase ROS generation. The increased ROS generation was fatal for ocular cells, but it promoted the growth of cancer cells. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

The goal of this study was to classify mice with and without tumors and compare tumors localized to the mammary pad and tumor cells injected into the iliac artery by differences in VOCs in urine. After 4T1.2 tumor cells were injected into BALB/c mice either in the mammary pad or into the iliac artery, urine was collected, VOCs from urine headspace were concentrated by solid phase microextraction and results were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry quadrupole time-of-flight. Multivariate and univariate statistical analyses were employed to find potential biomarkers for breast cancer and metastatic breast cancer in mice models. A set of six VOCs classified mice with and without tumors with an area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC AUC) of 0.98 (95% confidence interval [0.85, 1.00]) via five-fold cross validation.

Moreover, the high drug loading capacity of Cet-SLN was employed to encapsulate photothermal agent indocyanine green (ICG) to finally fabricate a versatile drug delivery system (DDS) able to co-deliver Cet and ICG (Cet-SLN/ICG) for combinational chemo-photothermal therapy of breast cancer. The obtained results clearly demonstrated that Cet-SLN/ICG was well-dispersed nanoparticles with preferable stability under physiological condition. Furthermore, due to the conjugation of Cet, Cet-SLN/ICG could target EGFR which overexpress in MCF-7 cells. Most importantly, both in vitro and in vivo results suggested that compared with Cet or ICG alone, the Cet-SLN/ICG showed superior anticancer efficacy.

        fabio:abstract    "The integration of genomic and DNA methylation data has been demonstrated as a powerful strategy in understanding cancer mechanisms and identifying therapeutic targets. The TCGA consortium has mapped DNA methylation in thousands of cancer samples using Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 K BeadChip (Illumina 450 K array) that only covers about 1.5% of CpGs in the human genome. Therefore, increasing the coverage of the DNA methylome would significantly leverage the usage of the TCGA data. Here, we present a new model called EAGLING that can expand the Illumina 450 K array data 18 times to cover about 30% of the CpGs in the human genome. We applied it to analyze 13 cancers in TCGA. By integrating the expanded methylation, gene expression, and somatic mutation data, we identified the genes showing differential patterns in each of the 13 cancers. Many of the triple-evidenced genes identified in majority of the cancers are biomarkers or potential biomarkers. Pan-cancer analysis also revealed the pathways in which the triple-evidenced genes are enriched, which include well known ones as well as new ones, such as axonal guidance signaling pathway and pathways related to inflammatory processing or inflammation response. Triple-evidenced genes, particularly TNXB, RRM2, CELSR3, SLC16A3, FANCI, MMP9, MMP11, SIK1, and TRIM59 showed superior predictive power in both tumor diagnosis and prognosis. These results have demonstrated that the integrative analysis using the expanded methylation data is powerful in identifying critical genes/pathways that may serve as new therapeutic targets. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "A key challenge facing immunotherapy is poor infiltration of T cells into tumors, along with suppression of cells reaching these sites. However, macrophages make up a majority of immune cell infiltrates into tumors, creating natural targets for immunotherapies able to direct macrophages away from tumor-supportive functions and toward anti-tumor phenotypes. Recent studies demonstrate that toll-like receptors (TLRs) – pathways that quickly trigger early immune responses – play an important role in polarizing macrophages. Here, we present emerging ways in which TLR signaling is being manipulated in macrophages to create new opportunities for cancer immunotherapy. In particular, we discuss approaches to deliver TLR agonists, to leverage biomaterials in these therapies, and to couple TLR-based approaches with other frontline treatments as combination cancer therapies. © 2019" ;

However, immune checkpoint inhibitors are only advantageous for a limited population of cancer patients. Therefore, companion diagnostics are needed in order to identify patients for whom these therapies are effective. In the present study, we evaluated detailed immunological aspects in clinical specimens from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. We analyzed the immune profiles, T cell cytotoxicity, and TCR repertoire of peripheral blood, normal lung tissue, and tumor tissue from NSCLC patients. By using bispecific T-cell engager technology to assess the cytotoxicity of T cells, we found that the cytotoxicity of tumor-infiltrated T cells closely correlated with that of peripheral T cells. This correlation was supported by the immune profiles, cytokine production, and results of the TCR repertoire analysis from these specimens. We also found that the cytotoxicity of peripheral T cells has potential as a predictor of the effects of nivolumab in the tumor microenvironment. These results imply further applications to blood-based immune monitoring systems and predictive biomarkers for cancer immunotherapy. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

This standard procedure relies on the slow radioactivity loss, usually attributed to the limited tumour expression of G6P-phosphatase (G6Pase). However, this classical interpretation intrinsically represents an approximation since, as in all tissues, cancer G6Pase activity is remarkable and is confined to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whose lumen must be reached by phosphorylated FDG to explain its hydrolysis and radioactivity release. The present study tested the impact of G6Pase sequestration on the mathematical description of FDG trafficking and handling in cultured cancer cells. Our data show that accounting for tracer access to the ER configures this compartment as the preferential site of FDG accumulation. This is confirmed by the reticular localization of fluorescent FDG analogues. Remarkably enough, reticular accumulation rate of FDG is dependent upon extracellular glucose availability, thus configuring the same ER as a significant determinant of cancer glucose metabolism. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Although current methods of treatment for cervical cancer can ablate lesions, preventing metastatic disseminations and excessive tissue injuries still remains a major concern. Hence, development of a safer and more efficient treatment modality is of vital importance. Natural products from plants are one of the principal sources of precursors to lead compounds with direct pharmaceutical application across all disease classes. One of these plants is Ficus carica, whose fruit latex, when applied on HPV-induced skin warts, has shown potential as a possible cure for this virus related lesions. This study explores the in vitro biological activities of fig latex and elucidates its possible mechanisms of action on cervical cancer cell lines CaSki and HeLa positive for HPV type 16 and 18, respectively. Our data shows that fig latex inhibits properties that are associated with HPV-positive cervical cancer transformed cells such as rapid growth and invasion and substantially downregulated the expression of p16 and HPV onco-proteins E6, E7. These findings suggest Ficus carica latex has the potential to be used in the development of therapeutic modalities for the possible treatment, cure and prevention of HPV related cervical cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing methods, the diversity and composition of the microbiota from ovarian cancer tissues (25 samples) and normal distal fallopian tube tissues (25 samples) were analyzed. High-throughput sequencing showed that the diversity and richness indexes were significantly decreased in ovarian cancer tissues compared to tissues from normal distal fallopian tubes. The ratio of the two phyla for Proteobacteria/Firmicutes was notably increased in ovarian cancer, which revealed that microbial composition change might be associated with the process of ovarian cancer development. In addition, transcriptome-sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses suggested that the transcriptional profiles were statistically different between ovarian carcinoma and normal distal fallopian tubes. Moreover, a set of genes including 84 different inflammation-associated or immune-associated genes, which had been named as the human antibacterial-response genes were also modulated expression. Therefore, we hypothesize that the microbial composition change, as a novel risk factor, may be involving the initiation and progression of ovarian cancer via influencing and regulating the local immune microenvironment of fallopian tubes except for regular pathways. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Several pioneering work have established that apart from genetic alterations, epigenetic modifications contribute significantly in tumor progression. Remarkable role of EZH2 in cancer highlights the importance of identifying its targets. Although much emphasis has been placed in recent years in designing drugs and inhibitors targeting EZH2, less effort has been given in exploring its existing targets that will help in understanding the oncogenic role of EZH2 in turn which may provide a more stringent method of targeting EZH2. In the present study, we validated six direct targets of EZH2 that are GPNMB, PMEPA1, CoL5A1, VGLL4, POMT2 and SUMF1 associated with cancer related pathways. Upon EZH2 knockdown, more than two fold increase in the target gene expression was evident. CHIP-qPCR performed in both MCF-7 and MDA-MDA-231 confirmed the in-vivo binding of EZH2 on its identified target. Thirty invasive breast carcinoma cases with their adjacent normal tissues were included in the study. Immunohistochemistry in primary breast tumor tissue array showed tumor dependent expression of EZH2. Array of MERAV expression database revealed the strength of association of EZH2 with its target genes. Real time PCR performed with RNA extracted from breast tumor tissues further authenticated the existing negative correlation between EZH2 and its target genes. Pearson correlation coefficient & statistical significance computed using the matrix provided in the database strengthened the negative correlation between identified target genes and EZH2. KM plotter analysis showed improved relapse-free survival with increased expression of PMEPA1, POMT2, VGLL4 and SUMF1 in breast cancer patients indicating their therapeutic potential. While investigating the relevance of these target genes, different mutations of them were found in breast cancer patients. Seeking the clinical relevance of our study, following our recent publication that reports the role of EZH2 in nicotine-mediated breast cancer development and progression, we observed significant reduced expression of SUMF1 in breast cancer patient samples with smoking history in comparison to never-smoked patient samples. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we report that TOP1MT is overexpressed in cancer tissues and demonstrate that TOP1MT deficiency attenuates tumor growth in human and mouse models of colon and liver cancer. Due to their mitochondrial dysfunction, TOP1MT-KO cells become addicted to glycolysis, which limits synthetic building blocks and energy supply required for the proliferation of cancer cells in a nutrient-deprived tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, we show that TOP1MT associates with mitoribosomal subunits, ensuring optimal mitochondrial translation and assembly of oxidative phosphorylation complexes that are critical for sustaining tumor growth. The TOP1MT genomic signature profile, based on Top1mt-KO liver cancers, is correlated with enhanced survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients.

A new data integrative approach, based on graphical models, was applied on our multi-modal –omics, and clinical data cohort of metastatic melanoma patients. We found that response to chemotherapy is directly linked to ten gene expression, four methylation variables and PARP1 SNP rs1805407. PARP1 is a DNA repair gene critical for chemotherapy response and for which FDA-approved inhibitors are clinically available (olaparib). We demonstrated that two PARP inhibitors (ABT-888 and olaparib) make SNP carrier cancer cells of various histologic subtypes more sensitive to alkylating agents, but they have no effect in wild-type cells. Furthermore, PARP1 inhibitors act synergistically with chemotherapy in SNP carrier cells (especially in ovarian cancer for which olaparib is FDA-approved), but they are additive at best in wild-type cancer cells. Taken together, our results suggest that the combination of chemotherapy and PARP1 inhibition may benefit the carriers of rs1805407 in the future and may be used in personalized therapy strategies to select patients that are more likely to respond to PARP inhibitors. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Earlier studies have shown that bovine α -lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells (BAMLET) becomes cytotoxic against cancer cells in complex with oleic acid {Hoque, M. et. al., PLoSOne8, e68390 (2013)}. In our study, we obtained bovine α-lactalbumin complexed with lanthanum ion (La 3+ -B-α-LA) and determined its high resolution crystal structure. The natural calcium binding site of bovine α-lactalbumin is replaced by lanthanum. The La 3+ complex formation by B-α-apo-LA was also supported by various biophysical methods. Interestingly, our complex, La 3+ -B-α-LA exhibits much greater anticancer activity against breast cancer cells as compared to the reported BAMLET-oleic acid complex. This study shows that La 3+ -B-α-LA complex is preferentially more toxic to MCF-7 cells as compared to KB (oral cancer) and HeLa (cervical) cells, while almost non-toxic to the healthy cells that we studied. Our data indicates that the cytotoxicity of La 3+ -B-α-LA against cancer cells is through apoptotic path way. The higher anticancer activity of La 3+ -B-α-LA is attributable to the requisite structural changes induced in the protein by La 3+ binding as supported by the crystal structure of the complex. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

However, no studies have evaluated vascular pain in patients with colorectal cancer in relation to peripheral venous administration of chemotherapy with or without oxaliplatin. We evaluated oxaliplatin-induced vascular pain using subjective and objective methods. We determined if oxaliplatin induced vascular pain in patients with colorectal cancer using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and a PainVision PS-2100 device. We compared VAS score between chemotherapy regimens with or without oxaliplatin, and between genders. We also examined the correlations of VAS score with pain intensity examined by the PainVision PS-2100, and with age and vessel diameter. A total of 98 patients with colorectal cancer were enrolled in this study, including 78 patients who received oxaliplatin via peripheral venous administration and 20 who received chemotherapy without oxaliplatin. The median VAS scores in patients with and without oxaliplatin were 36.5 (interquartile range 9.0–60.0) and 0 (0–4.0), respectively (P < 0.001), and the median pain intensities according to PainVision were 43.5 (14.3–98) and 36.5 (9.3–58.5), respectively (P < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between VAS and pain intensity (r = 0.584), but no correlation between VAS score and age (r = −0.174) or vessel diameter (r = −0.107). Peripheral venous administration of oxaliplatin induced vascular pain, measured both subjectively and objectively, in patients with colorectal cancer, regardless of vessel diameter. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Primary bronchial cancer accounts for almost 20% of all cancer death worldwide. One of the emerging techniques with tremendous power for lung cancer therapy is magnetic aerosol drug targeting (MADT). The use of a permanent magnet for effective drug delivery in a desired location throughout the lung requires extensive optimization, but it has not been addressed yet. In the present study, the possibility of using a permanent magnet for trapping the particles on a lung tumor is evaluated numerically in the Weibel's model from G0 to G3. The effect of different parameters is considered on the efficiency of particle deposition in a tumor located on a distant position of the lung bronchi and bronchioles. Also, the effective position of the magnetic source, tumor size, and location are the objectives for particle deposition. The results show that a limited particle deposition occurs on the lung branches in passive targeting. However, the incorporation of a permanent magnet next to the tumor enhanced the particle deposition fraction on G2 to up to 49% for the particles of 7 µm diameter. Optimizing the magnet size could also improve the particle deposition fraction by 68%. It was also shown that the utilization of MADT is essential for effective drug delivery to the tumors located on the lower wall of airway branches given the dominance of the air velocity and resultant drag force in this region. The results demonstrated the high competence and necessity of MADT as a noninvasive drug delivery method for lung cancer therapy." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. Adjuvant chemotherapy has significantly reduced mortality but increased cognitive impairments, including attention function, making quality of life issues a crucial concern. This study enrolled nineteen breast cancer patients who were treated with standard chemotherapy within 6 months and 20 sex-matched healthy controls to investigate the brain effects of chemotherapy. All participants underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) with mean fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (mfALFF) analysis and were correlated with neuropsychological tests, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised (CAMS-R), and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), to explore the possible underlying mechanism of cognitive alternations. We found increased mfALFF over the frontoparietal lobe and decreased mfALFF over the occipital lobe in the cancer patients compared with the healthy controls; the altered brain regions may be associated with the dorsal attention network (DAN) and may be explained by a compensatory mechanism. Both MMSE and CAMS-R scores showed a positive correlation with mfALFF in the occipital lobe but a negative correlation in the frontoparietal lobe. By contrast, IES-R scores showed a positive correlation with mfALFF in the frontoparietal lobe but a negative correlation in the occipital lobe. These alterations are potentially related to the effects of both chemotherapy and psychological distress. Future research involving a larger sample size of patients with breast cancer is recommended. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

In the case of mutations in individual genes that cause them to be incorrectly spliced, engineered splicing factors can be introduced to correct splicing of these aberrant transcripts and reduce the effects of the disease phenotype. Mutations that occur in certain splicing factor genes themselves have been implicated in many cancers, particularly myelodysplastic syndromes. Small molecules that target splicing factors have been developed as therapies to preferentially induce apoptosis in these cancer cells. Specifically, drugs targeting the splicing factor SF3B1 have led to recent clinical trials.

Analysis of AA-reconstructed amplicons in a pan-cancer dataset reveals many novel properties of copy number amplifications in cancer. These findings support a model in which focal amplifications arise due to the formation and replication of extrachromosomal DNA. Applying AA to 68 viral-mediated cancer samples, we identify a large fraction of amplicons with specific structural signatures suggestive of hybrid, human-viral extrachromosomal DNA.

There have been many attempts to identify markers and key pathways induced throughout EMT but the process is complex and depends on the cancer type and tumour microenvironment. Here we used the colon cancer cell line HT29, which stably overexpressed Snail, the key transcription factor in early EMT, as a model for colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with a pro-metastatic phenotype. We investigated miRNA expression regulation during that phenotypic switching. We found that overexpression of Snail in HT29 cells triggered significant changes in individual miRNA levels but did not change the global efficiency of miRNA processing. Snail abundance repressed the expression of miR-192 and miR-194 and increased miR-205, let-7i and SNORD13 levels. These identified changes correlated with the reported transcriptomic alterations in Snail-overexpressing HT29 cells. We also investigated how Snail affected the miRNA content of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from HT29 cells. Our data suggest that the presence of Snail significantly alters the complex mRNA/miRNA interactions in the early steps of metastasis and also has an impact on the content of EVs released from HT29 cells. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

This retrospective case-control study compared patients who had lung cancer with PJP (n = 112) or without PJP (n = 336) matched according to age, sex, histopathology, and stage. PJP definition was based on (i) positive PCR or direct immunofluorescence results for pneumocystis, (ii) clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities that were consistent with a pneumonic process, and (iii) received targeted PJP treatment. The development of PJP was associated with radiotherapy (RTx), concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRTx), lymphopenia, and prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (20 mg of prednisolone equivalent per day for ≥3 weeks). Multivariate analysis revealed independent associations with prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06–3.63; p = 0.032) and CCRTx (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.27–3.43; p = 0.004). Steroid use was frequently related to RTx pneumonitis or esophagitis (29 patients, 43.3%). Prolonged high-dose steroid therapy and CCRTx were risk factors for PJP development among patients with lung cancer. As these patients had a poor prognosis, clinicians should consider PJP prophylaxis for high-risk patients with lung cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

We performed an in silico analysis to determine the concordance in the frequencies of actionable mutations and copy number alterations/aberrations (CNAs) in the two most common breast cancer histologies, invasive lobular and invasive ductal carcinoma. We found that targeted sequencing identified a larger number of mutational hotspots and clinically significant amplifications that would have been missed by WES and SNP arrays in many actionable genes such as PIK3CA, EGFR, AKT3, FGFR1, ERBB2, ERBB3 and ESR1. The striking differences between the number of mutational hotspots and CNAs generated from these platforms highlight a number of factors that should be considered in the interpretation of array and NGS-based genomic data for precision medicine.

Several oxaliplatin transporters were previously identified but their relative contributions to determining oxaliplatin tumour responses and gastrointestinal tumour cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin remains unclear. We studied clinical associations between tumour expression of oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes and patient response to oxaliplatin, then experimentally verified associations found with MRP2 in models of human gastrointestinal cancer. Among 18 oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes, MRP2 was the only one to be differentially expressed in the tumours of colorectal cancer patients who did or did not respond to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Over-expression of MRP2 (endogenously in HepG2 and PANC-1 cells, or induced by stable transfection of HEK293 cells) decreased oxaliplatin accumulation and cytotoxicity but those deficits were reversed by inhibition of MRP2 with myricetin or siRNA knockdown. Mice bearing subcutaneous HepG2 tumour xenografts were sensitised to oxaliplatin antitumour activity by concurrent myricetin treatment with little or no increase in toxicity. In conclusion, MRP2 limits oxaliplatin accumulation and response in human gastrointestinal cancer.

We compare optimized gene signatures for cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin responses in the same cell lines and validate each signature using data from patients with cancer. Supervised support vector machine learning is used to derive gene sets whose expression is related to the cell line GI50 values by backwards feature selection with cross-validation. Specific genes and functional pathways distinguishing sensitive from resistant cell lines are identified by contrasting signatures obtained at extreme and median GI50 thresholds. Ensembles of gene signatures at different thresholds are combined to reduce the dependence on specific GI50 values for predicting drug responses. The most accurate gene signatures for each platin are: cisplatin: BARD1, BCL2, BCL2L1, CDKN2C, FAAP24, FEN1, MAP3K1, MAPK13, MAPK3, NFKB1, NFKB2, SLC22A5, SLC31A2, TLR4, and TWIST1; carboplatin: AKT1, EIF3K, ERCC1, GNGT1, GSR, MTHFR, NEDD4L, NLRP1, NRAS, RAF1, SGK1, TIGD1, TP53, VEGFB, and VEGFC; and oxaliplatin: BRAF, FCGR2A, IGF1, MSH2, NAGK, NFE2L2, NQO1, PANK3, SLC47A1, SLCO1B1, and UGT1A1. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with bladder, ovarian, and colorectal cancer were used to test the cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin signatures, resulting in 71.0%, 60.2%, and 54.5% accuracies in predicting disease recurrence and 59%, 61%, and 72% accuracies in predicting remission, respectively. One cisplatin signature predicted 100% of recurrence in non-smoking patients with bladder cancer (57% disease-free; N = 19), and 79% recurrence in smokers (62% disease-free; N = 35).

MTH1 dephosphorylates oxidized nucleotides, thereby preventing their incorporation into DNA and protecting tumour cells from oxidative DNA damage. Inhibitors of MTH1 (TH588 and (S)-crizotinib) were shown to reduce cancer cell viability. However, the MTH1-dependency of the anti-cancer effects of these drugs has recently been questioned. Here, we have assessed anti-tumour effects of TH588 and (S)-crizotinib in patient-derived 3D colorectal cancer cultures. Hypoxia and reoxygenation – conditions that increase intracellular ROS levels – increased sensitivity to (S)-crizotinib, but not to TH588. (S)-crizotinib reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-MET and ErbB3 whereas TH588 induced a mitotic cell cycle arrest, which was not affected by adding ROS-modulating compounds. Furthermore, we show that both compounds induced DNA damage that could not be prevented by adding the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Moreover, adding ROS-modulating compounds did not alter the reduction in viability in response to TH588 and (S)-crizotinib. We conclude that TH588 and (S)-crizotinib have very clear and distinct anti-tumour effects in 3D colorectal cancer cultures, but that these effects most likely occur through distinct and ROS-independent mechanisms. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Iron deposits are a phenotypic trait of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Histological iron imaging and contrast-agent free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect these deposits, but their presence in human cancer, and correlation with immunotherapeutic response is largely untested. Here, primarily using these iron imaging approaches, we evaluated the spatial distribution of polarized macrophage populations containing high endogenous levels of iron in preclinical murine models and human breast cancer, and used them as metabolic biomarkers to correlate TAM infiltration with response to immunotherapy in preclinical trials. Macrophage-targeted inhibition of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) by immunotherapy was confirmed to inhibit macrophage accumulation and slow mammary tumor growth in mouse models while also reducing hemosiderin iron-laden TAM accumulation as measured by both iron histology and in vivo iron MRI (FeMRI). Spatial profiling of TAM iron deposit infiltration defined regions of maximal accumulation and response to the CSF1R inhibitor, and revealed differences between microenvironments of human cancer according to levels of polarized macrophage iron accumulation in stromal margins. We therefore demonstrate that iron deposition serves as an endogenous metabolic imaging biomarker of TAM infiltration in breast cancer that has high translational potential for evaluation of immunotherapeutic response. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "More than 50% of colon cancers bear mutations in p53, one of the most important tumor suppressors, and its family members p63 or p73 are expected to contribute to inhibiting the progression of colon cancers. The AP2 family also acts as a tumor suppressor. Here we found that p73 and AP2 are able to activate NEU4, a neuraminidase gene, which removes the terminal sialic acid residues from cancer-associated glycans. Under serum starvation, NEU4 was up-regulated and one of the NEU4 target glycans, sialyl Lewis X, was decreased, whereas p73 and AP2 were up-regulated. Sialyl Lewis X levels were not, however, decreased under starvation conditions in p73- or AP2-knockdown cells. p53 and AP2 underwent protein-protein interactions, exerting synergistic effects to activate p21, and interaction of p53 with AP2 was lost in cells expressing the L350P mutation of p53. The homologous residues in p63 and p73 are L423 and L377, respectively. The synergistic effect of p53/p63 with AP2 to activate genes was lost with the L350P/L423P mutation in p53/p63, but p73 bearing the L377P mutation was able to interact with AP2 and exerted its normal synergistic effects. We propose that p73 and AP2 synergistically activate the NEU4 promoter in colon cancer cells. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Nanoparticles prepared by single emulsion method had a size of less than 300 nm with 70.7 ± 3.9% reaction yield and 26.4 ± 1.1% Hsp loading capacity. Treatment of C6 glioma cells with HspNPs for 24 and 48 h resulted in dose- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability, with approximate IC50 of 28 and 21 μg/mL, respectively (p = .036 for 24 h, p = .025 for 48 h). The percentage of PCNA positive cells decreased to 20% and 10%, respectively, for Hsp- and HspNP-treated cells at concentration of 100 µg/mL. Treatment with increasing concentrations of HspNPs (25, 50, 75 and 100 µg/mL) resulted in 9.1-, 7-, 12.5- and 12.7-fold in increase in apoptotic cell number. Optimum doses of Hsp and HspNPs were found to increase oxidative damage in C6 glioma cells. MDA levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were found to be significantly elevated at 75 and 100 µg/mL exposure concentration of HspNPs with (p = .002) and (p = .018), respectively for 48-h treatment. The results obtained with this study showed biocompatible polymeric nanoparticle systems has great advantages to enhance anti-cancer activity and poor solubility of therapeutic agents. Overall our findings suggest that Hsp-loaded PLGA nanoparticle systems showed significant anti-cancer activity and HspNPs could be used as promising novel anti-cancer agent." ;

GO exhibits pH-dependent fluorescence emission in the visible/near-infrared, providing a possibility of molecular imaging and pH-sensing. It is also water soluble and has a substantial platform for functionalization, allowing for the delivery of multiple therapeutics. GO physical properties are modified to enhance cellular internalization, producing fluorescent nanoflakes with low (<15%) cytotoxicity at the imaging concentrations of 15 μg/mL. As a result, at lower flake sizes GO rapidly internalizes into HeLa cells with the following 70% fluorescence based clearance at 24 h, assessed by its characteristic emission in red/near-IR. pH-dependence of GO emission is utilized to provide the sensing of acidic extracellular environments of cancer cells. The results demonstrate diminishing green/red (550/630 nm) fluorescence intensity ratios for HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells in comparison to HEK-293 healthy cells suggesting a potential use of GO as a non-invasive optical sensor for cancer microenvironments.

There have been many attempts to identify markers and key pathways induced throughout EMT but the process is complex and depends on the cancer type and tumour microenvironment. Here we used the colon cancer cell line HT29, which stably overexpressed Snail, the key transcription factor in early EMT, as a model for colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with a pro-metastatic phenotype. We investigated miRNA expression regulation during that phenotypic switching. We found that overexpression of Snail in HT29 cells triggered significant changes in individual miRNA levels but did not change the global efficiency of miRNA processing. Snail abundance repressed the expression of miR-192 and miR-194 and increased miR-205, let-7i and SNORD13 levels. These identified changes correlated with the reported transcriptomic alterations in Snail-overexpressing HT29 cells. We also investigated how Snail affected the miRNA content of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from HT29 cells. Our data suggest that the presence of Snail significantly alters the complex mRNA/miRNA interactions in the early steps of metastasis and also has an impact on the content of EVs released from HT29 cells. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

This retrospective case-control study compared patients who had lung cancer with PJP (n = 112) or without PJP (n = 336) matched according to age, sex, histopathology, and stage. PJP definition was based on (i) positive PCR or direct immunofluorescence results for pneumocystis, (ii) clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities that were consistent with a pneumonic process, and (iii) received targeted PJP treatment. The development of PJP was associated with radiotherapy (RTx), concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRTx), lymphopenia, and prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (20 mg of prednisolone equivalent per day for ≥3 weeks). Multivariate analysis revealed independent associations with prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06–3.63; p = 0.032) and CCRTx (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.27–3.43; p = 0.004). Steroid use was frequently related to RTx pneumonitis or esophagitis (29 patients, 43.3%). Prolonged high-dose steroid therapy and CCRTx were risk factors for PJP development among patients with lung cancer. As these patients had a poor prognosis, clinicians should consider PJP prophylaxis for high-risk patients with lung cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

We performed an in silico analysis to determine the concordance in the frequencies of actionable mutations and copy number alterations/aberrations (CNAs) in the two most common breast cancer histologies, invasive lobular and invasive ductal carcinoma. We found that targeted sequencing identified a larger number of mutational hotspots and clinically significant amplifications that would have been missed by WES and SNP arrays in many actionable genes such as PIK3CA, EGFR, AKT3, FGFR1, ERBB2, ERBB3 and ESR1. The striking differences between the number of mutational hotspots and CNAs generated from these platforms highlight a number of factors that should be considered in the interpretation of array and NGS-based genomic data for precision medicine.

Several oxaliplatin transporters were previously identified but their relative contributions to determining oxaliplatin tumour responses and gastrointestinal tumour cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin remains unclear. We studied clinical associations between tumour expression of oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes and patient response to oxaliplatin, then experimentally verified associations found with MRP2 in models of human gastrointestinal cancer. Among 18 oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes, MRP2 was the only one to be differentially expressed in the tumours of colorectal cancer patients who did or did not respond to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Over-expression of MRP2 (endogenously in HepG2 and PANC-1 cells, or induced by stable transfection of HEK293 cells) decreased oxaliplatin accumulation and cytotoxicity but those deficits were reversed by inhibition of MRP2 with myricetin or siRNA knockdown. Mice bearing subcutaneous HepG2 tumour xenografts were sensitised to oxaliplatin antitumour activity by concurrent myricetin treatment with little or no increase in toxicity. In conclusion, MRP2 limits oxaliplatin accumulation and response in human gastrointestinal cancer.

We compare optimized gene signatures for cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin responses in the same cell lines and validate each signature using data from patients with cancer. Supervised support vector machine learning is used to derive gene sets whose expression is related to the cell line GI50 values by backwards feature selection with cross-validation. Specific genes and functional pathways distinguishing sensitive from resistant cell lines are identified by contrasting signatures obtained at extreme and median GI50 thresholds. Ensembles of gene signatures at different thresholds are combined to reduce the dependence on specific GI50 values for predicting drug responses. The most accurate gene signatures for each platin are: cisplatin: BARD1, BCL2, BCL2L1, CDKN2C, FAAP24, FEN1, MAP3K1, MAPK13, MAPK3, NFKB1, NFKB2, SLC22A5, SLC31A2, TLR4, and TWIST1; carboplatin: AKT1, EIF3K, ERCC1, GNGT1, GSR, MTHFR, NEDD4L, NLRP1, NRAS, RAF1, SGK1, TIGD1, TP53, VEGFB, and VEGFC; and oxaliplatin: BRAF, FCGR2A, IGF1, MSH2, NAGK, NFE2L2, NQO1, PANK3, SLC47A1, SLCO1B1, and UGT1A1. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with bladder, ovarian, and colorectal cancer were used to test the cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin signatures, resulting in 71.0%, 60.2%, and 54.5% accuracies in predicting disease recurrence and 59%, 61%, and 72% accuracies in predicting remission, respectively. One cisplatin signature predicted 100% of recurrence in non-smoking patients with bladder cancer (57% disease-free; N = 19), and 79% recurrence in smokers (62% disease-free; N = 35).

MTH1 dephosphorylates oxidized nucleotides, thereby preventing their incorporation into DNA and protecting tumour cells from oxidative DNA damage. Inhibitors of MTH1 (TH588 and (S)-crizotinib) were shown to reduce cancer cell viability. However, the MTH1-dependency of the anti-cancer effects of these drugs has recently been questioned. Here, we have assessed anti-tumour effects of TH588 and (S)-crizotinib in patient-derived 3D colorectal cancer cultures. Hypoxia and reoxygenation – conditions that increase intracellular ROS levels – increased sensitivity to (S)-crizotinib, but not to TH588. (S)-crizotinib reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-MET and ErbB3 whereas TH588 induced a mitotic cell cycle arrest, which was not affected by adding ROS-modulating compounds. Furthermore, we show that both compounds induced DNA damage that could not be prevented by adding the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Moreover, adding ROS-modulating compounds did not alter the reduction in viability in response to TH588 and (S)-crizotinib. We conclude that TH588 and (S)-crizotinib have very clear and distinct anti-tumour effects in 3D colorectal cancer cultures, but that these effects most likely occur through distinct and ROS-independent mechanisms. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Iron deposits are a phenotypic trait of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Histological iron imaging and contrast-agent free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect these deposits, but their presence in human cancer, and correlation with immunotherapeutic response is largely untested. Here, primarily using these iron imaging approaches, we evaluated the spatial distribution of polarized macrophage populations containing high endogenous levels of iron in preclinical murine models and human breast cancer, and used them as metabolic biomarkers to correlate TAM infiltration with response to immunotherapy in preclinical trials. Macrophage-targeted inhibition of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) by immunotherapy was confirmed to inhibit macrophage accumulation and slow mammary tumor growth in mouse models while also reducing hemosiderin iron-laden TAM accumulation as measured by both iron histology and in vivo iron MRI (FeMRI). Spatial profiling of TAM iron deposit infiltration defined regions of maximal accumulation and response to the CSF1R inhibitor, and revealed differences between microenvironments of human cancer according to levels of polarized macrophage iron accumulation in stromal margins. We therefore demonstrate that iron deposition serves as an endogenous metabolic imaging biomarker of TAM infiltration in breast cancer that has high translational potential for evaluation of immunotherapeutic response. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "More than 50% of colon cancers bear mutations in p53, one of the most important tumor suppressors, and its family members p63 or p73 are expected to contribute to inhibiting the progression of colon cancers. The AP2 family also acts as a tumor suppressor. Here we found that p73 and AP2 are able to activate NEU4, a neuraminidase gene, which removes the terminal sialic acid residues from cancer-associated glycans. Under serum starvation, NEU4 was up-regulated and one of the NEU4 target glycans, sialyl Lewis X, was decreased, whereas p73 and AP2 were up-regulated. Sialyl Lewis X levels were not, however, decreased under starvation conditions in p73- or AP2-knockdown cells. p53 and AP2 underwent protein-protein interactions, exerting synergistic effects to activate p21, and interaction of p53 with AP2 was lost in cells expressing the L350P mutation of p53. The homologous residues in p63 and p73 are L423 and L377, respectively. The synergistic effect of p53/p63 with AP2 to activate genes was lost with the L350P/L423P mutation in p53/p63, but p73 bearing the L377P mutation was able to interact with AP2 and exerted its normal synergistic effects. We propose that p73 and AP2 synergistically activate the NEU4 promoter in colon cancer cells. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Nanoparticles prepared by single emulsion method had a size of less than 300 nm with 70.7 ± 3.9% reaction yield and 26.4 ± 1.1% Hsp loading capacity. Treatment of C6 glioma cells with HspNPs for 24 and 48 h resulted in dose- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability, with approximate IC50 of 28 and 21 μg/mL, respectively (p = .036 for 24 h, p = .025 for 48 h). The percentage of PCNA positive cells decreased to 20% and 10%, respectively, for Hsp- and HspNP-treated cells at concentration of 100 µg/mL. Treatment with increasing concentrations of HspNPs (25, 50, 75 and 100 µg/mL) resulted in 9.1-, 7-, 12.5- and 12.7-fold in increase in apoptotic cell number. Optimum doses of Hsp and HspNPs were found to increase oxidative damage in C6 glioma cells. MDA levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were found to be significantly elevated at 75 and 100 µg/mL exposure concentration of HspNPs with (p = .002) and (p = .018), respectively for 48-h treatment. The results obtained with this study showed biocompatible polymeric nanoparticle systems has great advantages to enhance anti-cancer activity and poor solubility of therapeutic agents. Overall our findings suggest that Hsp-loaded PLGA nanoparticle systems showed significant anti-cancer activity and HspNPs could be used as promising novel anti-cancer agent." ;

GO exhibits pH-dependent fluorescence emission in the visible/near-infrared, providing a possibility of molecular imaging and pH-sensing. It is also water soluble and has a substantial platform for functionalization, allowing for the delivery of multiple therapeutics. GO physical properties are modified to enhance cellular internalization, producing fluorescent nanoflakes with low (<15%) cytotoxicity at the imaging concentrations of 15 μg/mL. As a result, at lower flake sizes GO rapidly internalizes into HeLa cells with the following 70% fluorescence based clearance at 24 h, assessed by its characteristic emission in red/near-IR. pH-dependence of GO emission is utilized to provide the sensing of acidic extracellular environments of cancer cells. The results demonstrate diminishing green/red (550/630 nm) fluorescence intensity ratios for HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells in comparison to HEK-293 healthy cells suggesting a potential use of GO as a non-invasive optical sensor for cancer microenvironments. The results of this work demonstrate the potential of GO as a novel multifunctional platform for therapeutic delivery, biological imaging and cancer sensing. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Patients with primary cervical cancer and newly diagnosed were selected from ten different cancer specialist hospitals of Malaysia. Patients’ demographic and clinical data were obtained for the prognostic analysis. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate patients’ survival time (CSS and OS) with DM status and values were compared using the log-rank test. A total of 19,785 newly diagnosed CC patients were registered during 2010–2016, among them only 16,946 (85.6%) with primary CC tumor. There was no difference in treatment modality between DM and non-DM patients. However intergroup assessment showed that type 2DM have significantly higher rate of mortality in both overall mortality (28.3%) and CC-specific (11.7%) as compared to Type 1DM (17.3%; 5.5%) and non DM patients (12.7%; 9.1%) (p < 0.001). Within group assessments showed that Type 2DM patients have better quality of life (mean 7.13 ± 3.67) (p < 0.001) and less distress levels (mean 2.41 ± 0.63) (p < 0.011) as compared to type1 DM (meant 10.54 ± 2.11; 3.19 ± 1.07).

In order to tackle cancer heterogeneity and comply with the data dimensionality, a number of network and pathway approaches were invented but rarely systematically applied to this task. We propose a new method, called NEAmarker, for finding sensitive and robust biomarkers at the pathway level. scores from network enrichment analysis transform the original space of altered genes into a lower-dimensional space of pathways. These dimensions are then correlated with phenotype variables. The method was first tested using in vitro data from three anti-cancer drug screens and then on clinical data of The Cancer Genome Atlas. It proved superior to the single-gene and alternative enrichment analyses in terms of (1) universal applicability to different data types with a possibility of cross-platform integration, (2) consistency of the discovered correlates between independent drug screens, and (3) ability to explain differential survival of treated patients. Our new screen of anti-cancer compounds validated the performance of multivariate models of drug sensitivity. The previously proposed methods of enrichment analysis could achieve comparable levels of performance in certain tests. However, only our method could discover predictors of both in vitro response and patient survival given administration of the same drug. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

SPIONs entrapped in the core of the nanocomplex may act as a hyperthermia agent and generate localized heat upon excitation with an alternating magnetic field (AMF), thus enabling a thermo-chemotherapy strategy for cancer treatment. Accordingly, the cytotoxic effect and the mode of cell death triggered by the nanocomplex in combination with AMF were evaluated on two different cancer cell lines with various folate receptor (FR) expression levels, including KB nasopharyngeal cancer cells overexpressing FRs as the model and MCF-7 breast cancer cells with low level of FRs as the blank sample. The obtained results showed that KB cell death was greater than the cell death observed in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, a majority of cell death in both cell lines were related to apoptosis when the folate-modified nanocomplex was used instated of the non-folate-modified nanocomplex. Therefore, functionalizing the nanocomplex with folate modulated the response to thermo-chemotherapy by shifting the cell death pathways toward apoptosis." ;

We examined TILs grades of pretreatment cancer tissue specimens and residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab and determined the predictive utility of the TILs grade in pathological complete response (pCR) and the prognostic power of TILs in HER2-positive breast cancer. This cohort study included 128 HER2-positive breast cancer who received NAC with trastuzumab. TILs grading of the tumor stroma in pretreatment biopsy specimens and residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab was categorized as low, intermediate, and high based on the criteria of the International Working Group. In current study, the pCR rate was 64.8%, and the Relapse-free survival (RFS) was significantly worse in the non-pCR group than in the pCR group. The pCR rate correlated with the TILs grade in pretreatment tumors. In 45 non-pCR patients, TILs grade was higher in the residual tumors than in the pretreatment tumors. The RFS was significantly better in residual tumors with high TILs grade than those with low TILs grade (p = 0.033). In conclusion, assessment of the TILs grade in residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab might be necessary to determine patients with good prognosis among those who do not achieve pCR. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Most targeting strategies of anticancer drug delivery systems (DDSs) rely on the surface functionalization of nanocarriers with specific ligands, which trigger the internalization in cancer cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The endocytosis implies the entrapment of DDSs in acidic vesicles (endosomes and lysosomes) and their eventual ejection by exocytosis. This process, intrinsic to eukaryotic cells, is one of the main drawbacks of DDSs because it reduces the drug bioavailability in the intracellular environment. The escape of DDSs from the acidic vesicles is, therefore, crucial to enhance the therapeutic performance at low drug dose. To this end, we developed a multifunctionalized DDS that combines high specificity towards cancer cells with endosomal escape capabilities. Doxorubicin-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles were functionalized with polyethylenimine, a polymer commonly used to induce endosomal rupture, and hyaluronic acid, which binds to CD44 receptors, overexpressed in cancer cells. We show irrefutable proof that the developed DDS can escape the endosomal pathway upon polymeric functionalization. Interestingly, the combination of the two polymers resulted in higher endosomal escape efficiency than the polyethylenimine coating alone. Hyaluronic acid additionally provides the system with cancer targeting capability and enzymatically controlled drug release. Thanks to this multifunctionality, the engineered DDS had cytotoxicity comparable to the pure drug whilst displaying high specificity towards cancer cells. The polymeric engineering here developed enhances the performance of DDS at low drug dose, holding great potential for anticancer therapeutic applications. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The use of oncolytic viruses (OVs) for cancer treatment is emerging as a successful strategy that combines the direct, targeted killing of the cancer with the induction of a long-lasting anti-tumor immune response. Using multiple aggressive murine models of triple-negative breast cancer, we have recently demonstrated that the early administration of oncolytic Maraba virus (MRB) prior to surgical resection of the primary tumor is sufficient to minimize the metastatic burden, protect against tumor rechallenge, cure a fraction of the mice and sensitize refractory tumors to immune checkpoint blockade without the need for further treatment. Here, we apply our surgical model to other OVs: Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Adenovirus (Ad), Reovirus (Reo) and Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and show that all of the tested OVs could positively change the outcome of the treated animals. The growth of the primary and secondary tumors was differently affected by the various OVs and most of the viruses conferred survival benefits in this neoadjuvant setting despite the absence of direct treatment following rechallenge. This study establishes that OV-therapy confers long-term protection when administered in the pre-operative window of opportunity. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase is overexpressed in approximately 15–20% of breast tumors and associated with aggressive disease and poor clinical outcome. p130Cas represents a nodal scaffold protein regulating cell survival, migration and proliferation in normal and pathological contexts. p130Cas overexpression in ErbB2 human breast cancer correlates with poor prognosis and metastasis formation. Recent data indicate that p130Cas association to ErbB2 protects ErbB2 from degradation, thus enhancing tumorigenesis. Therefore, inhibiting p130Cas/ErbB2 interaction might represent a new therapeutic strategy to target breast cancer. Here we demonstrate by performing Molecular Modeling, Molecular Dynamics, dot blot, ELISA and fluorescence quenching experiments, that p130Cas binds directly to ErbB2. Then, by structure-based virtual screening, we identified two potential inhibitors of p130Cas/ErbB2 interaction. Their experimental validation was performed in vitro and in ErbB2-positive breast cancer cellular models. The results highlight that both compounds interfere with p130Cas/ErbB2 binding and significantly affect cell proliferation and sensitivity to Trastuzumab. Overall, this study identifies p130Cas/ErbB2 complex as a potential breast cancer target revealing new therapeutic perspectives for protein-protein interaction (PPI). © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Gastric cancer (GC) ranks as the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, and approximately 42% of all cases diagnosed each year worldwide are diagnosed in China. A large number of clinical applications have revealed that Trametes robiniophila Μurr. (Huaier) exhibits an anti-tumour effect. However, loss of the bioactive components of Huaier during the extraction procedure with water is unavoidable, and the underlying mechanism of the anti-cancer effect of Huaier remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer effect of Huaier n-butanol extract, which contained 51.4% total flavonoids, on HGC27, MGC803, and AGS human GC cell lines in vitro. At a low concentration, Huaier n-butanol extract inhibited the growth of these GC cell types, induced cell cycle arrest and reduced cell metastasis. Moreover, Huaier n-butanol extract suppressed the c-Myc-Bmi1 signalling pathway, and overexpression of Bmi1 reversed the effects of Huaier n-butanol extract on GC cells. Thus, our findings indicate that Huaier n-butanol extract suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of GC cells via a c-Myc-Bmi1-mediated approach, providing a new perspective for our understanding of the anti-tumour effects of Huaier. These results suggest that Huaier n-butanol extract could be an attractive therapeutic adjuvant for the treatment of human GC. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

In the present study, we screened the anticancer potential of supernatant metabolites from eight native haloarchaeal strains obtained from a culture collection in Iran. Five human cancer cell lines including breast, lung, prostate and also human fibroblast cells as the normal control were used in the present study. Moreover, to evaluate the anti-tumor effect of the selected supernatant, inhibition of sphere formation and tumor development was assessed in-vitro and in-vivo, respectively. Among all strains, supernatant metabolites from Halobacterium salinarum IBRC M10715 had the most potent cytotoxic effect on prostate cancer cell lines (IC50 = 0.5 mg/mL) without any effects on normal cells. It significantly increased both early and late apoptosis (about 11% and 9%, respectively) in the androgen-dependent PC3 cell line, reduced sphere formation ability of DU145 and PC3 cells with down-regulation of SOX2 gene expression. Furthermore, our results revealed that tumors developed in nude mice significantly shrank post intratumor injection of metabolites of the haloarchaeal strain. In conclusion, we suggested here for the first time that supernatant metabolites from Halobacterium salinarum IBRC M10715 could be a novel component against prostate cancer in-vitro and in-vivo with remarkable reduction in stem-like properties of tumor. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

The main HNSCC risk factors are tobacco, excessive alcohol use, and the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV positive (+) cancers are etiologically different from other HNSCC and often show better prognosis. The current knowledge regarding HNSCC miRNA profiles is still incomplete especially in the context of HPV+ cancer. Thus, we analyzed 61 freshly collected primary oral (OSCC) and oropharyngeal (OPSCC) SCC samples. HPV DNA and RNA was found in 21% cases. The Illumina whole-genome small-RNA profiling by next-generation sequencing was done on 22 samples and revealed 7 specific miRNAs to HPV+ OSCC, 77 to HPV+ OPSCC, and additional 3 shared with both; 51 miRNAs were specific to HPV− OPSCC, 62 to HPV− OSCC, and 31 shared with both. The results for 9 miRNAs (miR-9, -21, -29a, -100, -106b, -143 and -145) were assessed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction on the whole study population. The data was additionally confirmed by reanalyzing publicly available miRNA sequencing Cancer Genome Atlas consortium (TCGA) HNSCC data. Cell signaling pathway analysis revealed differences between HPV+ and HPV− HNSCC. Our findings compared with literature data revealed extensive heterogeneity of miRNA deregulation with only several miRNAs consistently affected, and miR-9 being the most likely HPV related miRNA. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Development of combined therapies constitutes an effective strategy to inhibit cancer cells and prevent the emergence of drug resistance. For this purpose, we investigated the anti-tumoral effect of thirteen phenolic compounds, from the Tunisian quince Cydonia oblonga Miller, alone or combined to 5-FU, on the human 5-FU-resistant LS174-R colon cancer cells in comparison to parental cells. Our results showed that only Kaempferol was able to chemo-sensitize 5-FU-resistant LS174-R cells. This phenolic compound combined with 5-FU exerted synergistic inhibitory effect on cell viability. This combination enhanced the apoptosis and induced cell cycle arrest of both chemo-resistant and sensitive cells through impacting the expression levels of different cellular effectors. Kaempferol also blocked the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and modulated the expression of JAK/STAT3, MAPK, PI3K/AKT and NF-κB. In silico docking analysis suggested that the potent anti-tumoral effect of Kaempferol, compared to its two analogs (Kaempferol 3-O-glucoside and Kampferol 3-O-rutinoside), can be explained by the absence of glucosyl groups. Overall, our data propose Kaempferol as a potential chemotherapeutic agent to be used alone or in combination with 5-FU to overcome colon cancer drug resistance. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Considering the high prevalence and mortality rate of colorectal cancer, in this study we tried to design and validate a standard printed form and evaluate oncologists’ and nurses’ adherence to this form. This cross-sectional study was performed in Omid hospital, Mashhad, Iran from January 2015 to October 2015. A Chemotherapy form including various demographic and clinical parameters and approved chemotherapy regimens for colorectal cancer was designed by the clinical pharmacist and validated by clinical oncologists working in this center. All eligible patients admitted in this center during this period of time were included in the study. Adherence of the oncologists and nurses to this form and probable medication errors were identified by the pharmacy student. Sixty-seven patients with colorectal cancer and a total of 251 chemotherapy courses were evaluated. All patients received regimens compatible with developed form but in 206 courses (98.56%) of chemotherapy dosing error happened and in most of cases patients received lower than calculated dose (37.8%). Three errors occurred in administration step by nurses which they infused the medication in shorter than recommended duration. In general, oncologists’ adherence with developed form for chemotherapy of colorectal cancer was relatively high, except in dose calculation. Avoiding from rounding the calculated medications’ doses and precise calculation of patients’ body surface area can prevent most of medication errors and reduce risk of adverse drug reaction occurrence. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

Nevertheless, the importance of transfusion timing is still unclear. The primary purpose of this study is to appraise whether the receipt of intraoperative blood transfusion (BT) differ from postoperative BT in regards to cancer outcomes in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients treated with nephrectomy. Data on 1168 patients with RCC, who underwent radical or partial nephrectomy as primary therapy between 1988–2013 were analyzed. PBT was defined as transfusion of allogeneic red blood cells (RBC) during surgery or the postsurgical period. Survival was analyzed and compared using the Kaplan–Meier method with the log-rank test. Of 1168 patients, 198 patients (16.9%) received a PBT. Including 117 intraoperative BT and 81 postoperative BT. Only 21 (10.6%) patients required both intraoperative and postoperative BT. On multivariate analyses, receipt of PBT was associated with significantly worse local disease recurrence (HR: 2.4; P = 0.017), metastatic progression (HR: 2.7; P = 0.005), cancer-specific mortality (HR: 3.5; P = 0.002) and all-cause mortality (HR: 2.1; P = 0.005). Nevertheless, postoperative BT was not independently associated with increased risk of local recurrence (p = 0.1), metastatic progression (P = 0.16) or kidney cancer death (P = 0.63), yet did significantly increase the risk of overall mortality (HR: 2.6; P = 0.004).

For this reason novel therapies accounting for PDAC peculiarities, such as the relevant stromal reaction, are urgently needed. Here adipose mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (AD-MSC) have been armed to constantly release a soluble trimeric and multimeric variant of the known anti-cancer TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (sTRAIL). This cancer gene therapy strategy was in vitro challenged demonstrating that sTRAIL was thermally stable and able to induce apoptosis in the PDAC lines BxPC-3, MIA PaCa-2 and against primary PDAC cells. sTRAIL released by AD-MSC relocated into the tumor stroma was able to significantly counteract tumor growth in vivo with a significant reduction in tumor size, in cytokeratin-7+ cells and by an anti-angiogenic effect. In parallel, histology on PDAC specimens form patients (n = 19) was performed to investigate the levels of TRAIL DR4, DR5 and OPG receptors generating promising insights on the possible clinical translation of our approach. These results indicate that adipose MSC can very efficiently vehicle a novel TRAIL variant opening unexplored opportunities for PDAC treatment. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Malignant melanoma is one of the untreatable cancers in which conventional therapeutic strategies, including chemotherapy, are hardly effective. Therefore, identification of novel therapeutic targets involved in melanoma progression is urgently needed for developing effective therapeutic methods. Overexpression of interleukin-13 receptor α2 (IL13Rα2) is observed in several cancer types including glioma and pancreatic cancer. Although IL13Rα2 is implicated in the progression of various types of cancer, its expression and roles in the malignant melanoma have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we showed that IL13Rα2 was expressed in approximately 7.5% melanoma patients. While IL13Rα2 expression in human melanoma cells decreased their proliferation in vitro, it promoted in vivo tumour growth and angiogenesis in melanoma xenograft mouse model. We also found that the expression of amphiregulin, a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, was correlated with IL13Rα2 expression in cultured melanoma cells, xenograft tumour tissues and melanoma clinical samples. Furthermore, expression of amphiregulin promoted tumour growth, implicating causal relationship between the expression of IL13Rα2 and amphiregulin. These results suggest that IL13Rα2 enhances tumorigenicity by inducing angiogenesis in malignant melanoma, and serves as a potential therapeutic target of malignant melanoma. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

However, its prognostic value and the underlying mechanism in lung cancer remains unclear. Herein we evaluated the expression of PKD2 in lung adenocarcinoma and investigated its relationship with EMT. GSEA, TCGA and K-M plotter database were applied and revealed that high PKD2 expression predicted poor outcome and related with lymph nodes metastasis in lung cancer. IHC and qRT-PCR were performed and found PKD2 was elevated in lung adenocarcinoma and negatively related with OS (p = 0.015), PFS (p = 0.006) and the level of E-cadherin (p = 0.021). Experiment in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines demonstrated up-regulation of PKD2 led to high expression of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vim, mmp9 et al.) and EMT transcription factors(zeb1, twist, snail), and the results were reversed when PKD2 was knocked down. Further investigation showed that abrogation of PKD2 inhibited A549 cell migration, invasion, proliferation and induced cell arrest in G2/M phase. We concluded that high expression of PKD2 was associated with poor prognosis and cancer progression in lung adenocarcinoma patients by promoting EMT. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

We showed for the first time that Raman imaging can be used to distinguish successfully between glycosylated and nonglycosylated proteins in normal and cancer tissue. Thousands of protein, lipid and glycan species exist in cells and tissues and their metabolism is monitored via numerous pathways, networks and methods. The metabolism can change in response to cellular environment alterations, such as development of a disease. Measuring such alterations and understanding the pathways involved are crucial to fully understand cellular metabolism in cancer development. In this paper Raman markers of glycogen, glycosaminoglycan, chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate proteoglycan were identified based on their vibrational signatures. High spatial resolution of Raman imaging combined with chemometrics allows separation of individual species from many chemical components present in each cell. We have found that metabolism of proteins, lipids and glycans is markedly deregulated in breast (adenocarcinoma) and brain (medulloblastoma) tumors. We have identified two glycoforms in the normal breast tissue and the malignant brain tissue in contrast to the breast cancer tissue where only one glycoform has been identified. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Very recently, we postulated that the incorporation of citral into nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC-Citral) improves solubility and delivery of the citral without toxic effects in vivo. Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate anti-cancer effects of NLC-Citral in MDA MB-231 cells in vitro through the Annexin V, cell cycle, JC-1 and fluorometric assays. Additionally, this study is aimed to effects of NLC-Citral in reducing the tumor weight and size in 4T1 induced murine breast cancer model. Results showed that NLC-Citral induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest in MDA MB-231 cells. Furthermore, a prominent anti-metastatic ability of NLC-Citral was demonstrated in vitro using scratch, migration and invasion assays. A significant reduction of migrated and invaded cells was observed in the NLC-Citral treated MDA MB-231 cells. To further evaluate the apoptotic and anti-metastatic mechanism of NLC-Citral at the molecular level, microarray-based gene expression and proteomic profiling were conducted. Based on the result obtained, NLC-Citral was found to regulate several important signaling pathways related to cancer development such as apoptosis, cell cycle, and metastasis signaling pathways. Additionally, gene expression analysis was validated through the targeted RNA sequencing and real-time polymerase chain reaction. In conclusion, the NLC-Citral inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells in vitro, majorly through the induction of apoptosis, anti-metastasis, anti-angiogenesis potentials, and reducing the tumor weight and size without altering the therapeutic effects of citral. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The incidence of developing cancer should increase with the body mass, yet is not the case, a conundrum referred to as Peto’s paradox. Elephants have a lower incidence of cancer suggesting that these animals have probably evolved different ways to protect themselves against the disease. The paradox is worth revisiting with the realization that most mammals encode an endogenous APOBEC3 cytidine deaminase capable of mutating single stranded DNA. Indeed, the mutagenic activity of some APOBEC3 enzymes has been shown to introduce somatic mutations into genomic DNA. These enzymes are now recognized as causal agent responsible for the accumulation of CG- > TA transitions and DNA breaks leading to chromosomal rearrangements in human cancer genomes. Here, we identified an elephant A3Z1 gene, related to human APOBEC3A and showed that it could efficiently deaminate cytidine, 5-methylcytidine and produce DNA breaks leading to massive apoptosis, similar to other mammalian APOBEC3A enzymes where body mass varies by up to four orders of magnitude. Consequently, it could be considered that eAZ1 might contribute to cancer in elephants in a manner similar to their proposed role in humans. If so, eAZ1 might be particularly well regulated to counter Peto’s paradox. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

The cells and mitochondria were isolated from cancerous and non-cancerous ovarian tissues and exposed to IC 50 concentration of F1 fraction for evaluation of mitochondrial and cellular parameters. Our results showed that F1 fraction of T. coronatus crude extract significantly induced toxic effects only in the cancerous ovarian mitochondria, including increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, mitochondrial swelling, and cytochrome c release.Flow-cytometry analysis demonstrated that F1 fraction of T. coronatus progressively induced apoptosis and necrosis only on EOC but not non-cancerous cells.

Biotin-PEG-PCL polymers have been used for targeted drug delivery to cancer, as well as to improve the pharmacokinetics of the drug and reduce its effects. In this study, biotin-conjugated copolymers were fabricated with polymerization of the ring opening method and the properties of copolymer and nanoparticles were investigated using various techniques. The toxicity of artemisinin and its nanoparticles have been investigated on MCF-7 and normal HFF2 cells. The results showed that the encapsulation efficacy of artemisinin in nanoparticles was 45.5 ± 0.41%. The release profile of the drug indicates that the release is slow and controlled and is approximately pH dependent. The results of artemisinin cell culture on human breast cancer cells showed that biotin-PEG-PCL nanoparticles had an inhibitory effect on MCF-7 cells and had no toxic effects on HFF2 cells. Anticancer activity in vivo in the 4T1 breast cancer model showed that tumour volumes were decreased up 40 mm3 by ART-loaded micelles and 76 mm3 by free ART, compared to the control group (2150 mm). In vivo results showed that this formulation significantly increases the accumulation of substances in the tumours. Therefore, the molecular formulation of ART-based copolymers can be a desirable process for cancer treatment purposes. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group." ;

Previous reports have shown the effectiveness of BP in treating cancer diseases. However, BP has no targeting capacity towards specific cancer cells. To improve treatment efficiency and reduce the dose of BP used in cancer treatment, targeting-based approaches should be developed. In the present study, we used riboflavin-5′-phosphate (RFMP) immobilized iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4 MNPs) as carriers for BP to treat cancer cell lines derived from liver, prostate and breast. These model cancer cells overexpress riboflavin receptors on their cell membrane and are also sensitive to BP treatment. Thus, BP-binding free RFMP on MNPs can be used as probes to target these model cells, whereas BP can be readily released on target cancer cells. Cell viability was twofold lower by using Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs immobilized with BP than that achieved by using free-form BP at a similar amount. Moreover, BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs have no apparent harmful effects on non-target cells. In addition, we evaluated the level of cysteine-aspartic acid protease 3 (caspase 3) in the resultant cell lysate obtained after treatment by BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs to demonstrate that apoptosis is mainly involved in the growth inhibition of target cells. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Patients with laryngeal cancer (ICD-10: C32) between 2009 and 2010 were retrospectively identified and tracked until 2015 using the Korean Health Insurance claims database. During the seven-year follow-up period, 5,322 subjects were newly diagnosed with larynx cancer. The mean age of people with laryngeal cancer was much higher than those without (63.29 vs. 47.7 years, p < 0.0001), and the incidence of larynx cancer in men was much higher than that in women (93.16% vs. 6.84%, p < 0.0001). Age, gender, smoking status, alcohol intake, and exercise-adjusted hazard ratios indicated that participants with MetS had a 1.13-fold higher hazard of having larynx cancer than those without MetS. The number of MetS components was a strong risk factor for laryngeal cancer with a higher risk estimate of this cancer in both ex- and current smokers as well as people who have never smoked. MetS was found to be an independent risk factor for the incidence of laryngeal cancer.

        fabio:abstract    "Chromosome changes are one of the hallmarks of human malignancies. Chromosomal rearrangement is frequent in human cancers. One of the consequences of chromosomal rearrangement is gene fusions in the cancer genome. We have previously identified a panel of fusion genes in aggressive prostate cancers. In this study, we showed that 6 of these fusion genes are present in 7 different types of human malignancies with variable frequencies. Among them, the CCNH-C5orf30 and TRMT11-GRIK2 gene fusions were found in breast cancer, colon cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, ovarian cancer and liver cancer, with frequencies ranging from 12.9% to 85%. In contrast, four other gene fusions (mTOR-TP53BP1, TMEM135-CCDC67, KDM4-AC011523.2 and LRRC59-FLJ60017) are less frequent. Both TRMT11-GRIK2 and CCNH-C5orf30 are also frequently present in lymph node metastatic cancer samples from the breast, colon and ovary. Thus, detecting these fusion transcripts may have significant biological and clinical implications in cancer patient management. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Quantifying the genetic correlation between cancers can provide important insights into the mechanisms driving cancer etiology. Using genome-wide association study summary statistics across six cancer types based on a total of 296,215 cases and 301,319 controls of European ancestry, here we estimate the pair-wise genetic correlations between breast, colorectal, head/neck, lung, ovary and prostate cancer, and between cancers and 38 other diseases. We observed statistically significant genetic correlations between lung and head/neck cancer (r g = 0.57, p = 4.6 × 10 −8 ), breast and ovarian cancer (r g = 0.24, p = 7 × 10 −5 ), breast and lung cancer (r g = 0.18, p =1.5 × 10 −6 ) and breast and colorectal cancer (r g = 0.15, p = 1.1 × 10 −4 ). We also found that multiple cancers are genetically correlated with non-cancer traits including smoking, psychiatric diseases and metabolic characteristics.

        fabio:abstract    "Purpose: Several previous studies have shown that oral bisphosphonates (BPs) are associated with the incidence of 13 specific cancers, including lung cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the findings are heterogeneous. Methods and results: Relevant studies published in databases such as PubMed, Embase database, and Cochrane library were systematically retrieved from inception to August 25th, 2018, regardless of language, by two investigators independently. Afterwards, the maximum adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted from the retrieved studies. Finally, 13 cohort studies involving 1,510,763 participants were enrolled into this meta-analysis. No significant relationship was found between oral BPs and the risk of all-cause cancer in osteoporosis (OP) patients among the entire population (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80–1.18; I 2 92.5%). Besides, oral BPs could remarkably reduce the incidence of breast cancer (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68–0.92; I 2 54%) and endometrial cancer (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64–0.96; I 2 0%) in postmenopausal OP females. In addition, oral BPs were also found to evidently reduce the incidence of upper gastrointestinal cancer in OP patients among the entire population (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54–0.98; I 2 36.1%). However, oral BPs may lead to increased risk of liver cancer in mixed genders (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.03–2.77; I 2 30.7%). Conclusions: Taken together, oral BPs do not increase the risk of incidence of all-cause cancer; instead, they can reduce the incidence of breast, endometrial, and upper gastrointestinal cancers among the postmenopausal OP females. Our analysis stratified by gender suggests that oral BPs may increase the incidence of liver cancer in mixed genders, while no significant association was observed in females. Careful analysis of post-marketing data should be conducted to address the clinical relevance of our results on the putative association of oral BP use and liver cancer suggested by our meta-analysis. © 2018, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation." ;

However, it remains unclear how cancer cells migrate in the three-dimensional (3D) matrix of cancer tissues and how CAFs support the cancer invasion. Here we propose a novel mechanism of fibroblast-dependent cancer cell invasion in the 3D collagen matrix. Human cancer cell lines from the pancreas (Panc-1), lung (A549) and some other organs actively adhered to normal fibroblasts and primary lung CAFs in cultures. To show its significance in tumor invasion, we designed a new invasion assay in which homogeneous microspheroids consisting of cancer cells and fibroblasts were embedded into collagen gel. Time-lapse experiments showed that cancer cells adhered to and quickly migrated on the long protrusions of fibroblasts in the 3D collagen matrix. Fibroblast-free cancer cells poorly invaded the matrix. Experiments with function-blocking antibodies, siRNAs, and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that cancer cells adhered to fibroblasts through integrin α5β1-mediated binding to fibronectin on the surface of fibroblasts. Immunochemical analyses of the co-cultures and lung cancers suggested that cancer cells could acquire the migratory force by the fibronectin/integrin signaling. Our results also revealed that the fibroblast-bound fibronectin was a preferential substrate for cancer cells to migrate in the collagen matrix. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

However, very few studies investigated the role of integrin α3 (ITGα3) in malignant cancers. Here, we determined the functional role of ITGα3 in pancreatic cancer. Analysis of public microarray databases and Western blot analysis indicated a unique expression of ITGα3 in human pancreatic cancer. Silencing ITGα3 expression significantly inhibited the viability and migration of human pancreatic cancer cells. Notably, ablation of ITGα3 expression resulted in a significant decrease of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression compared with transfection of control-siRNA through an increased number of leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domain protein 1 (LRIG1) expression. In addition, ablating ITGα3 inhibited tumour growth via blockade of EGFR signalling in vivo. Furthermore, the highly expressed ITGα3 led to a poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. Our results provide novel insights into ITGα3-induced aggressive pancreatic cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Since epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in promoting metastasis of cancer, many mechanisms regarding EMT have been studied. We previously showed that Ribonucleic acid export 1 (RAE1) is dysregulated in breast cancer and its overexpression leads to aggressive breast cancer phenotypes by inducing EMT. Here, we evaluated the functional capacity of RAE1 in breast cancer metastasis by using a three-dimensional (3D) culture system and xenograft models. Furthermore, to investigate the mechanisms of RAE1-driven EMT, in vitro studies were carried out. The induction of EMT with RAE1-overexpression was confirmed under the 3D culture system and in vivo system. Importantly, RAE1 mediates upregulation of an EMT marker ZEB1, by binding to the promoter region of ZEB1. Knockdown of ZEB1 in RAE1-overexpressing cells suppressed invasive and migratory behaviors, accompanied by an increase in epithelial and a decrease in mesenchymal markers. Taken together, these data demonstrate that RAE1 contributes to breast cancer metastasis by regulating a key EMT-inducing factor ZEB1 expression, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Obesity is a risk factor for many cancers including breast, esophageal, colon, and thyroid cancer. We aimed to evaluate the association of thyroid cancer with body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and weight change. This nationwide population-based cohort study included 11,323,006 adults who joined the national health screening program. Weight change was defined as the difference between the weight of the subjects measured during the study period and the weight at the time of four years ago. For evaluating the association between the weight change and the risk of thyroid cancer, subjects without weight change for four years were defined as the reference group. Mean age was 50.1 ± 13.7 years and 44% were female. In total, 50,464 subjects (0.4%) had newly-diagnosed thyroid cancer. After multivariable analyses, the incidence of thyroid cancer increased significantly in subjects with larger WC as well as higher BMI (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). In subjects who were lean and became obese, the incidence of thyroid cancers increased significantly (hazard ratio [HR] 1.15 [1.11–1.19]). In subjects who were obese and became lean, the incidence of thyroid cancers decreased significantly (HR 0.89 [0.86–0.93]). These results demonstrated that higher BMI and larger WC were significantly associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer. Weight gain in lean subjects was associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer, and weight reduction in subjects with obesity was associated with a decreased risk of thyroid cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

In order to understand this increase, country specific dietary exposures have been investigated. The aim of this study was to quantify the association between consumption of brown cheese, a common bread topping in Norway, and colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer in the prospective Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) Study. Data on brown cheese consumption and adjustment factors was available for 82 527 women. During a mean of 14.6 years of follow-up (1.2 million person-years), there were 1360 cases of colorectal cancer (907 colon; 453 rectal). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer sites. We modelled restricted cubic splines with 4 knots, to assess a possible non-linear relationship between brown cheese intake and the investigated cancer sites. In the age-adjusted model, consumption of more than 2 slices (>16 grams) of brown cheese per day was associated with 13% reduced risk of colon cancer (95% CI 4%-21%) compared to women who did not consume brown cheese. The multivariable-adjusted model, however, showed no association between brown cheese consumption and the risk of colorectal, colon, or rectal cancer (colorectal: HR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.76–1.13, p-trend 0.37; colon: HR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.65–1.06; p-trend = 0.10; rectal: HR = 1.16, 95% CI 0.84–1.1.61, p-trend = 0.41). In this large, prospective cohort study of women, consumption of brown cheese was suggestively protective against colon cancer. However, adjustment attenuated the inverse risk association. Brown cheese consumption was not associated with rectal cancer, or colorectal cancer overall. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Current cancer diagnosis utilizes histopathology, which requires tissue acquisition, extensive processing and, in most cases, relies on the qualitative morphological analysis of tissues and cells. Molecular biomarkers are only available for a few specific tumor subtypes. We discovered that the fluorescence polarization (Fpol) of Methylene Blue (MB) is significantly higher in cancer than in normal human breast tissues and cells. We confirmed that fluorescence polarization imaging did not affect the viability of the cells and yielded highly significant differences between cancer and normal cells using MB concentrations as low as 0.05 and 0.01 mg/ml. To explain this phenomenon we examined intracellular localization of MB and its fluorescence lifetime. We determined that higher fluorescence polarization of MB occurs due to its increased accumulation in mitochondria of cancer cells, as well as shorter fluorescence lifetime in cancer relative to normal cells. As quantitative MB Fpol imaging can be performed in vivo and in real time, it holds the potential to provide an accurate quantitative marker of cancer at the cellular level. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

The anticancer polymers are designed to target anionic lipids exposed on the cancer cell surfaces and act by disrupting the cancer cell membranes. Because the polymer mechanism is not dependent on cell proliferation, we hypothesized that the polymers were active against dormant cancer cells. The polymers exhibited cytotoxicity to proliferating prostate cancer. Importantly, the polymer killed dormant prostate cancer cells that were resistant to docetaxel. This study demonstrates a new approach to discover novel anticancer therapeutics. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

We developed a novel computational platform applying a multi-modal approach to filter out passengers and more robustly identify putative driver genes. The primary filter identifies enrichment of cancer mutations in CATH functional families (CATH-FunFams) – structurally and functionally coherent sets of evolutionary related domains. Using structural representatives from CATH-FunFams, we subsequently seek enrichment of mutations in 3D and show that these mutation clusters have a very significant tendency to lie close to known functional sites or conserved sites predicted using CATH-FunFams. Our third filter identifies enrichment of putative driver genes in functionally coherent protein network modules confirmed by literature analysis to be cancer associated. Our approach is complementary to other domain enrichment approaches exploiting Pfam families, but benefits from more functionally coherent groupings of domains. Using a set of mutations from 22 cancers we detect 151 putative cancer drivers, of which 79 are not listed in cancer resources and include recently validated cancer associated genes EPHA7, DCC netrin-1 receptor and zinc-finger protein ZNF479. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Cox proportional hazards models were used. Males and females classified as obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg /m −2 ) have a 33% and 22% increased risk of all-cancer, respectively, than their normal weight counterparts. Similar all-cancer risk increases are observed for those above sex-specific WC guidelines.

Collectively, 86.3% (63/73) of HAMPs have recurrent alterations in at least 1 cancer type and 16 HAMPs, including 9 understudied HAMPs, are identified as putative therapeutic targets across multiple cancer types. For example, the recurrent focal amplification of BRD9 is observed in 9 cancer types and genetic depletion of BRD9 inhibits tumor growth.

        fabio:abstract    "The current system for evaluating prostate cancer architecture is the Gleason grading system which divides the morphology of cancer into five distinct architectural patterns, labeled 1 to 5 in increasing levels of cancer aggressiveness, and generates a score by summing the labels of the two most dominant patterns. The Gleason score is currently the most powerful prognostic predictor of patient outcomes; however, it suffers from problems in reproducibility and consistency due to the high intra-observer and inter-observer variability amongst pathologists. In addition, the Gleason system lacks the granularity to address potentially prognostic architectural features beyond Gleason patterns. We evaluate prostate cancer for architectural subtypes using techniques from topological data analysis applied to prostate cancer glandular architecture. In this work we demonstrate the use of persistent homology to capture architectural features independently of Gleason patterns. Specifically, using persistent homology, we compute topological representations of purely graded prostate cancer histopathology images of Gleason patterns 3,4 and 5, and show that persistent homology is capable of clustering prostate cancer histology into architectural groups through a ranked persistence vector. Our results indicate the ability of persistent homology to cluster prostate cancer histopathology images into unique groups with dominant architectural patterns consistent with the continuum of Gleason patterns. In addition, of particular interest, is the sensitivity of persistent homology to identify specific sub-architectural groups within single Gleason patterns, suggesting that persistent homology could represent a robust quantification method for prostate cancer architecture with higher granularity than the existing semi-quantitative measures. The capability of these topological representations to segregate prostate cancer by architecture makes them an ideal candidate for use as inputs to future machine learning approaches with the intent of augmenting traditional approaches with topological features for improved diagnosis and prognosis. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Accumulative studies demonstrate that UHRF1 is broadly overexpressed in cancers, which contributes to cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Interestingly, a proteasome-dependent downregulation of UHRF1 has been observed in pluripotent ground state mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) cultured in the presence of two kinase (MEK1/MEK2 and GSK3β) inhibitors (termed 2i), raising the question whether UHRF1 is similarly regulated in cancer cells. Here we present evidence that while addition of 2i broadly downregulates UHRF1 and DNMT1 in various cancer cells, distinct underlying mechanisms are involved. In contrast to mESCs, 2i-induced downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in cancer cells cannot be rescued by proteasome inhibitor and occurs primarily at the level of transcription. Furthermore, downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 by 2i is due to inhibition of MEK1/MEK2, but not GSK3β activity. Data mining reveals a marked co-expression of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in normal tissues as well as cancers. We provide evidence that multiple transcription factors including E2F1 and SP1 mediate the transcriptional activation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 by the activated MEK/ERK pathway. Together our study reveals distinct regulation of UHRF1/DNMT1 in mESCs and cancer cells and identifies activated MEK/ERK pathway as a driving force for coordinated and aberrant over-expression of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in cancers. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

When it is applied to cancer cells, solid stress hinders their proliferation rate and promotes cancer cell invasion and metastatic potential.

Here, we used two pancreatic cancer cell lines and an established in vitro system to study the effect of solid stress-induced signal transduction on pancreatic cancer cell migration as well as the mechanism involved. Our results show that the migratory ability of cells increases as a direct response to solid stress. We also found that Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) expression and secretion is strongly upregulated in pancreatic cancer cells in response to mechanical compression. Performing a phosphoprotein screening, we identified that solid stress activates the Akt/CREB1 pathway to transcriptionally regulate GDF15 expression, which eventually promotes pancreatic cancer cell migration. Our results suggest a novel solid stress signal transduction mechanism bringing GDF15 to the centre of pancreatic tumor biology and rendering it a potential target for future anti-metastatic therapeutic innovations. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

We have reported that mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mitROS) upregulate uptake transporter of porphyrins, heme carrier protein-1 (HCP-1). The accumulation of cancer-specific porphyrins was increased by mitROS production, thereby the cancer-specific PDT cytotoxicity was enhanced. Thus we investigated whether mitROS production by hyperthermia can enhanced the cytotoxicity of PDT or not. In this study, 1 h of hyperthermia at 42 °C increased the mitROS production, and both the accumulation of cancer-specific porphyrins and the PDT cytotoxicity increased. Moreover, the authors treated cells with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) to examine the effect of mitROS. NAC inhibited the increasing ROS production after hyperthermia to restrain the post-treatment increase of cancer-specific porphyrins accumulation. Moreover, the increase of ROS production in cancer cells after hyperthermia upregulated HCP-1 expression and downregulated ABCG2 expression. These regulation were inhibited by NAC. These results suggest that hyperthermia treatment increased mitROS production, which involved HpD accumulation and enhanced PDT effects in cancer cells. The mechanism of this phenomenon was most likely to be due to both the upregulation of HCP-1 and the downregulation of ABCG2 by mitROS. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Recent studies showed that changes to the gut microbiome alters the microbiome-derived metabolome, potentially promoting carcinogenesis in organs that are distal to the gut. In this study, we assessed the relationship between breast cancer and cadaverine biosynthesis. Cadaverine treatment of Balb/c female mice (500 nmol/kg p.o. q.d.) grafted with 4T1 breast cancer cells ameliorated the disease (lower mass and infiltration of the primary tumor, fewer metastases, and lower grade tumors). Cadaverine treatment of breast cancer cell lines corresponding to its serum reference range (100–800 nM) reverted endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, inhibited cellular movement and invasion, moreover, rendered cells less stem cell-like through reducing mitochondrial oxidation. Trace amino acid receptors (TAARs), namely, TAAR1, TAAR8 and TAAR9 were instrumental in provoking the cadaverine-evoked effects. Early stage breast cancer patients, versus control women, had reduced abundance of the CadA and LdcC genes in fecal DNA, both responsible for bacterial cadaverine production. Moreover, we found low protein expression of E. coli LdcC in the feces of stage 1 breast cancer patients. In addition, higher expression of lysine decarboxylase resulted in a prolonged survival among early-stage breast cancer patients. Taken together, cadaverine production seems to be a regulator of early breast cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

The specific function of CBX6 in breast cancer is currently undefined. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset led to the identification of CBX6 as a consistently downregulated gene in breast cancer. We provided evidence showing enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) negatively regulated CBX6 expression in a Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)-dependent manner. Exogenous overexpression of CBX6 inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation, and induced cell cycle arrest along with suppression of migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro. Microarray analyses revealed that CBX6 governs a complex gene expression program. Moreover, CBX6 induced significant downregulation of bone marrow stromal cell antigen-2 (BST2), a potential therapeutic target, via interactions with its promoter region. Our collective findings support a tumor suppressor role of CBX6 in breast cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "MRI plays important roles in endometrial and cervical cancer assessment, from detection to recurrent disease evaluation. Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common malignant tumor of the female genital tract in Western countries. EC patients are divided into risk categories based on histopathological tumor type, grade, and myometrial invasion depth. EC is surgically staged using the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) system. Since FIGO (2009) stage correlates with prognosis, preoperative staging is essential for tailored treatment. MRI reveals myometrial invasion depth, which correlates with tumor grade and lymph node metastases, and thus correlates with prognosis. Cervical cancer (CC) is the second most common cancer, and the third leading cause of cancer-related death among females in developing countries. The FIGO Gynecologic Oncology Committee recently revised its CC staging guidelines, allowing staging based on imaging and pathological findings when available. The revised FIGO (2018) staging includes node involvement and thus enables both therapy selection and evaluation, prognosis estimation, and calculation of end results. MRI can accurately assess prognostic indicators, e.g., tumor size, parametrial invasion, pelvic sidewall, and lymph node invasion. Despite these important roles of MRI, radiologists still face challenges due to the technical and interpretation pitfalls of MRI during all phases of endometrial and cervical cancer evaluation. Awareness of mimics that can simulate both cancers is critical. With careful application, functional MRI with DWI and DCE sequences can help establish a correct diagnosis, although it is sometimes necessary to perform biopsy and histopathological analysis. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

This led to the first biological based liquid biopsy test, which we called MATER-D platform. In the present study, we showed for the first time that a different type of OMCs (PTEN-deficient human epithelial MCF10A cells) turn malignant when exposed to cancer patient’s sera, confirming the concept that different cells with diverse oncosuppressor mutations can uptake cancer factors and be used in biological based liquid biopsy tests. Our observations were confirmed in a large variety of solid and haematological malignancies. This test was able to detect dysplasia and carcinomas in situ lesions in different organs and circulating factors in cancer patients years after the removal of their lesions. To our knowledge, this ability is unique and not shared by other liquid biopsy platforms. Immunohistochemistry analysis of the xenotransplants revealed identical patterns of differentiation regardless of the cancer type, showing that differentiation through horizontal transfer might be dependent on the nature of the target cells rather than the type of cancer factors. These data strengthen the notion that OMC-based liquid biopsy tests might be promising platforms for cancer screening. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Various studies have shown the significance of identifying drug targets for cancer, although this process continues challenging in the field of anti-cancer drug designing. The primary purpose of this study is to design a novel approach to identify target genes for cancer. The sub-network of colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancers were constructed from human protein–protein interaction network. The potential genes were analyzed using hubs and centrality measures. For the identification of target genes, we retrieve those genes that had the highest score in both mutation rates and graph centrality. Moreover, gene deletion analysis revealed that MYC, TP53, and EGFR genes remained potential targets in colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancer respectively. Results suggest that combining network measures with mutation frequencies in cancer genes might assist in recognizing several potential drug targets. Future enhancement of this current approach is to combine these network properties with the biological insights from gene expression data, and their functions will provide a reliable method for rational drug designing. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature." ;

Owing to enhanced permeability and retention in solid tumor tissue, nanoparticle (NP) delivery systems have been emerged as novel strategy in cancer chemotherapy. As extracellular matrix, glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) could bind its surface receptor adhesion molecule CD44 which is strongly expressed on breast cancer. We have previously reported a doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded HA-Lys-LA X-NPs (X-NP-DOX) NP delivery system for breast cancer treatment. In this study, we further investigated the antitumor effect of X-NP-DOX NP delivery system using low-dose DOX in both in vitro and in vivo systems. We demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX possessed the ability for inhibiting MCF-7 breast cancer cell growth, invasion, and migration, and inducing apoptosis in vitro. In in vivo experiments, injection of low-dose X-NP-DOX into tumor-bearing mouse resulted in significant reduction of tumor size. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining further revealed that low-dose X-NP-DOX induced higher percentage of apoptotic cells compared with free DOX or saline. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX inhibited Notch1 and Ras/MAPK pathways, decreased cancer stem cell population, and reduced tumorigenesis compared to free DOX in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Owing to its enhanced efficacy and higher targetability compared to free DOX, low-dose DOX delivered by NP system may be a promising novel strategy for breast cancer treatment." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Breast cancer survivors display altered inflammatory responses to immune challenges relative to cancer-naive controls likely due to previous cancer treatments, stress associated with cancer, and/or tumor physiology. Proper inflammatory responses are necessary for adaptive sickness behaviors (e.g., fatigue, anorexia, and fever) and neuroinflammatory pathways are also implicated in mental health disturbances (e.g., cognitive impairment, depression) suffered by cancer patients and survivors. Rodent cancer models indicate that tumors are sufficient to exacerbate neuroinflammatory responses after an immune challenge, however primary tumors are not usually present in cancer survivors, and the behavioral consequences of these brain changes remain understudied. Therefore, we tested the extent to which mammary tumor resection attenuates tumor-induced neuroinflammation and sickness behavior following an immune challenge (i.p. lipopolysaccharide [LPS] injection) in mice. Tnf-α, Il-1β, and Il-6 mRNA decreased in multiple brain regions of LPS-treated tumor-bearing mice relative to LPS-treated controls; tumor resection attenuated these effects in some cases (but not Tnf-α). Tumors also attenuated sickness behaviors (hypothermia and lethargy) compared to LPS-treated controls. Tumor resection reversed these behavioral consequences, although basal body temperature remained elevated, comparable to tumor-bearing mice. Thus, tumors significantly modulate neuroinflammatory pathways with functional consequences and tumor resection mitigates most, but not all, of these changes. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Although substantial advances have been obtained both in treatment and survival rates, there is still a need for new therapeutical approaches. Natural compounds are a realistic source of new bioactive compounds with anticancer activity. Among them, rosemary polyphenols have shown a vast antiproliferative capacity against colon cancer cells in vitro and in animal models. We have investigated the antitumor activity of a rosemary extract (RE) obtained by using supercritical fluid extraction through its capacity to inhibit various signatures of cancer progression and metastasis such as proliferation, migration, invasion and clonogenic survival. RE strongly inhibited proliferation, migration and colony formation of colon cancer cells regardless their phenotype. Treatment with RE led to a sharp increase of intracellular ROS that resulted in necrosis cell death. Nrf2 gene silencing increased RE cytotoxic effects, thus suggesting that this pathway was involved in cell survival. These in vitro results were in line with a reduction of tumor growth by oral administration of RE in a xenograft model of colon cancer cells using athymic nude mice. These findings indicate that targeting colon cancer cells by increasing intracellular ROS and decreasing cell survival mechanisms may suppose a therapeutic option in colon cancer through the combination of rosemary compounds and chemotherapeutic drugs. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Although cure rates are high for early stage disease, clinical outcomes for advanced, metastatic, or recurrent disease remain poor. To change this panorama, a deeper understanding of cervical cancer biology and novel study models are needed. Immortalized human cancer cell lines such as HeLa constitute crucial scientific tools, but there are few other cervical cancer cell lines available, limiting our understanding of a disease known for its molecular heterogeneity. This study aimed to establish novel cervical cancer cell lines derived from Brazilian patients. We successfully established one (HCB-514) out of 35 cervical tumors biopsied. We confirmed the phenotype of HCB-514 by verifying its’ epithelial and tumor origin through cytokeratins, EpCAM and p16 staining. It was also HPV-16 positive. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) showed relevant somatic mutations in several genes including BRCA2, TGFBR1 and IRX2. A copy number variation (CNV) analysis by nanostring and WES revealed amplification of genes mainly related to kinases proteins involved in proliferation, migration and cell differentiation, such as EGFR, PIK3CA, and MAPK7. Overexpression of EGFR was confirmed by phospho RTK-array and validated by western blot analysis. Furthermore, the HCB-514 cell line was sensitive to cisplatin. In summary, this novel Brazilian cervical cancer cell line exhibits relevant key molecular features and constitutes a new biological model for pre-clinical studies. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Oncogene-induced replication stress (RS) promotes cancer development but also impedes tumor growth by activating anti-cancer barriers. To determine how cancer cells adapt to RS, we have monitored the expression of different components of the ATR-CHK1 pathway in primary tumor samples. We show that unlike upstream components of the pathway, the checkpoint mediators Claspin and Timeless are overexpressed in a coordinated manner. Remarkably, reducing the levels of Claspin and Timeless in HCT116 cells to pretumoral levels impeded fork progression without affecting checkpoint signaling. These data indicate that high level of Claspin and Timeless increase RS tolerance by protecting replication forks in cancer cells. Moreover, we report that primary fibroblasts adapt to oncogene-induced RS by spontaneously overexpressing Claspin and Timeless, independently of ATR signaling. Altogether, these data indicate that enhanced levels of Claspin and Timeless represent a gain of function that protects cancer cells from of oncogene-induced RS in a checkpoint-independent manner. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Turmeric, since in ancient Indian traditional medicinal system, has been implicated for its therapeutic and chemopreventive properties against a broad spectrum of diseases. Curcumin, the active polyphenol from turmeric, helps to obstruct the growth of many types of cancers at various stages which include prostrate, melanoma, breast, brain tumor, pancreatic, leukemia, etc. The initiation and recurrence of cancer have been attributed to few mutated cells in bulk of tumor called as cancer stem cells which have the capacity of self-renewal and differentiation. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3B) is a multifunctional serine/threonine protein kinase, originally found in mammals, an important component of diverse signaling pathways, dysregulation of which leads to affect the cancer stem cell properties. The nutritional- and phytochemical-based dietary interventions may complement current chemotherapy to prevent recurrence and relapse of cancer. The objective of present study is to investigate the effect of retinoic acid and curcumin–retinoic acid conjugates against GSK-3B protein. The in silico results indicate that molecule 3 (curcumin–retinoic acid conjugates) might be a potent inhibitor of GSK-3B and a novel future drug candidate for the treatment of cancer. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature." ;

        fabio:abstract    "In this study, we aimed to identify mutations of key genes associated with docetaxel resistance in nine endometrial cancer cell lines. Endometrial cancers are associated with several critical gene mutations, including PIK3A, PTEN, and KRAS. Different gene mutations in endometrial cancer cells have varied responses to anticancer drugs and cancer therapies. The most frequently altered gene in endometrioid endometrial carcinoma tumors is PTEN. PTEN protein has lipid phosphatase and protein phosphatase activity, as well as other functions in the nucleus. Although the tumor-suppressive function of PTEN has mainly been attributed to its lipid phosphatase activity, a role for PTEN protein phosphatase activity in cell cycle regulation has also been suggested. Various tumor type-specific PTEN mutations are well documented. Here, nine endometrioid endometrial cancer cell lines with PIK3A, PTEN, and KRAS gene mutations were treated with docetaxel and radiation. One mutation with a docetaxel drug-resistant effect was a truncated form of PTEN. Among PTEN mutations in endometrial cancer cells, the Y68 frame shift mutation of PTEN constitutes a major mechanism of resistance to docetaxel treatment. The molecular mechanism involves truncation of the 403 amino acid PTEN protein at amino acid 68 by the Y68 frame shift, leading to the loss of PTEN protein phosphatase and lipid phosphatase activities. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Hence to mimic such complex biological processes, an understanding of stimuli responsiveness is needed to sense specific changes and respond in a predictable manner. Such responses due to polymers may take place either simultaneously at the site or in a sequential manner from preparation to transporting pathways to cellular compartments. The present review comprehends the stimuli-responsive polymers and multi-responsiveness with respect to cancer therapy. It focuses on the exploitation of different stimuli like temperature, pH and enzymes responsiveness in a multi-stimuli setting. Nanogels and micelles being two of the most commonly used responsive polymeric carriers have also been discussed. The role of multiple stimuli delivery system is significant due to multiple changes happening in the near surroundings of cancer cells. These responsive materials are able to mimic some biological processes and recognize at the molecular level itself to manipulate development of custom-designed molecules for targeting cancer cells." ;

In contrast, antibodies to BLV were found in a very small percentage of healthy blood donors. There was no association between BLV DNA and other tumor prognostic biological markers such as hormonal receptors, HER2 oncoprotein, proliferation index, metastasis in sentinels lymph nodes, and tumor grade and size. Our findings suggest that BLV should be considered a potential predisposing factor to breast cancer in women. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Here we report that ovarian cancer cells manifest a spectrum of tumorigenic phenotypes upon knockdown of PIK3R1. PIK3R1 loss activates AKT and p110-independent JAK2/STAT3 signaling through inducing changes in the phosphorylation of the docking protein Gab2, thereby relieving the negative inhibition on AKT and promoting the assembly of JAK2/STAT3 signalosome, respectively. Additional mechanisms leading to AKT activation include enhanced p110α kinase activity and a decrease in PTEN level. PIK3R1 loss renders ovarian cancer cells vulnerable to inhibition of AKT or JAK2/STAT3. The combination of AKT and STAT3 inhibitors significantly increases the anti-tumor effect compared to single-agent treatments.

Finally, analysis of 214 prostate and 35 breast cancer genomes reveal that late-replicating regions are prone to cis and early-replication to trans chromosomal rearrangements.

        fabio:abstract    "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are promising therapies for haematological cancers. Historically, their therapeutic benefit is due to ADC targeting of lineage-restricted antigens. The C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is attractive for targeted therapy of haematological cancers, given its expression in multiple tumour types and role in cancer “homing” to bone marrow. However, CXCR4 is also expressed in haematopoietic cells and other normal tissues, raising safety challenges to the development of anti-CXCR4 ADCs for cancer treatment. Here, we designed the first anti-CXCR4 ADC with favourable therapeutic index, effective in xenografts of haematopoietic cancers resistant to standard of care and anti-CXCR4 antibodies. We screened multiple ADC configurations, by varying type of linker-payload, drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR), affinity and Fc format. The optimal ADC bears a non-cleavable linker, auristatin as payload at DAR = 4 and a low affinity antibody with effector–reduced Fc. Contrary to other drugs targeting CXCR4, anti-CXCR4 ADCs effectively eliminated cancer cells as monotherapy, while minimizing leucocytosis. The optimal ADC selectively eliminated CXCR4 + cancer cells in solid tumours, but showed limited toxicity to normal CXCR4 + tissues, sparing haematopoietic stem cells and progenitors. Our work provides proof-of-concept that through empirical ADC design, it is possible to target proteins with broad normal tissue expression. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Cancers in the bone produce a number of severe symptoms including pain that compromises patient functional status, quality of life, and survival. The source of this pain is multifaceted and includes factors secreted from tumor cells. Malignant cells release the neurotransmitter and cell-signaling molecule glutamate via the oxidative stress-related cystine/glutamate antiporter, system x C − , which reciprocally imports cystine for synthesis of glutathione and the cystine/cysteine redox cycle. Pharmacological inhibition of system x C − has shown success in reducing and delaying the onset of cancer pain-related behavior in mouse models. This investigation describes the development of a stable siRNA-induced knockdown of the functional trans-membrane system x C − subunit xCT (SLC7A11) in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Clones were verified for xCT knockdown at the transcript, protein, and functional levels. RNAseq was performed on a representative clone to comprehensively examine the transcriptional cellular signature in response to xCT knockdown, identifying multiple differentially regulated factors relevant to cancer pain including nerve growth factor, interleukin-1, and colony-stimulating factor-1. Mice were inoculated intrafemorally and recordings of pain-related behaviors including weight bearing, mechanical withdrawal, and limb use were performed. Animals implanted with xCT knockdown cancer cells displayed a delay until the onset of nociceptive behaviors relative to control cells. These results add to the body of evidence suggesting that a reduction in glutamate release from cancers in bone by inhibition of the system x C − transporter may decrease the severe and intractable pain associated with bone metastases. © The Author(s) 2018." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Background: The global cancer incidence and the number of survivors are increasing. Therefore, it is necessary to pay more attention to the side effects of treatment. Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of reflexology on the side effects of chemotherapy in cancer patients. Method: For finding the related articles, the researchers searched several databases including PubMed &ProQuest and valid websites including ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Scientific Information Database, and Magiran. The key terms of \"reflexology, cancer, and chemotherapy\" individually and combined together were searched in Parisian and English, and the studies performed from 2009 to 2018 were extracted. Due to the lack of sufficient studies carried out into the outcome of reflexology on chemotherapy, both Persian and English articles were used. Results: A total of 57 studies were extracted from the databases and valid websites; five of which met the inclusion criteria. All selected studies were clinical trials. Implications for Practice: Reflexology can be used as a non-pharmacologic nursing intervention to alleviate the side effects of chemotherapy and improve the quality of life of cancer patients. © 2018 Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

        fabio:abstract    "CD47 is a prominent new target in cancer immunotherapy, with antagonistic antibodies currently being evaluated in clinical trials. For effective evaluation of this strategy it is crucial to identify which patients are suited for CD47-targeted therapy. In this respect, expression of the pro-phagocytic signal SLAMF7 on both macrophages and cancer cells was recently reported to be a requisite for CD47 antibody-mediated phagocytosis. Here, we demonstrate that in fact SLAMF7 expression on cancer cells is not required and does not impact on CD47 antibody therapy. Moreover, SLAMF7 also does not impact on phagocytosis induction by CD20 antibody rituximab nor associates with overall survival of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma patients. In contrast, expression of CD47 negatively impacts on overall and progression free survival. In conclusion, cancer cell expression of SLAMF7 is not required for phagocytosis and, in contrast to CD47 expression, should not be used as selection criterion for CD47-targeted therapy. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Increased Crabp2 levels have been found in various types of cancer, and are associated with poor patients’ survival. Although Crabp2 is found to be overexpressed in lung cancer, its role in metastasis of lung cancer is unclear. In this study, Crabp2 was overexpressed in high-metastatic C10F4 than low-metastatic lung cancer cells. Analysis of clinical samples revealed that high CRABP2 levels were correlated with lymph node metastases, poor overall survival, and increased recurrence. Knockdown of Crabp2 decreased migration, invasion, anoikis resistance, and in vivo metastasis. Crabp2 was co-immunoprecipitated with HuR, and overexpression of Crabp2 increased HuR levels, which promoted integrin β1/FAK/ERK signaling. Inhibition of HuR or integrin β1/FAK/ERK signaling reversed the promoting effect of Crabp2 in migration, invasion, and anoikis resistance. Knockdown of Crabp2 further inhibited the growth of cancer cells as compared with that by gemcitabine or irinotecan alone. The expression of Crabp2 in human lung tumors was correlated with stress marker CHOP. In conclusion, our findings have identified the promoting role of Crabp2 in anoikis resistance and metastasis. CRABP2 may serve as a prognostic marker and targeting CRABP2 may be exploited as a modality to reduce metastasis. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "SPG-56 is a newly isolated glycoprotein from sweet potatoes (Zhongshu NO. 1), but its value for suppressing breast cancer progression remains unknown. This study was designed to investigate the potential anti-cancer effects of SPG-56, which consists of 2.9% sugar and 97.1% protein. The effects of SPG-56 on the proliferation and apoptosis of breast cancer cells were determined using CCK-8 and Hoechst 33342 assays and flow cytometry, after staining with Annexin V and PI respectively. The activities of SPG-56 against breast cancer were examined using female BALB/c nude mice orthotopically implanted with human breast carcinoma cells of the types MCF-7 and 4T1-Luc. The cellular experiments showed that SPG-56 inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of MCF-7 cells dose- and time-dependently. Oral administration of SPG-56 significantly suppressed the development of MCF-7 tumor cells (P < 0.01) as compared with an untreated group. The serum tumor markers CEA, CA125 and CA153 in a 240 mg/kg/d SPG-56 decreased by 54.8%, 91.8%, and 90.3%, respectively. The experiments further demonstrated that SPG-56 inhibited the metastasis of breast cancer in MCF-7 and 4T1-bearing mice by altering the expression of MMP2, MMP9, VEGF, Occludin and Claudin. It is concluded that SPG-56 may have potential as a novel anti-tumor candidate for breast cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Lymph node metastasis is of major prognostic significance for breast cancer. Lymph node metastasis arises at a very early stage in some patients. Using the data downloaded from the TCGA database, we studied the differences between primary tumors with and without lymph node metastasis at the multi-omics level using bioinformatics approaches. Our study found that low mutation and neoantigen burdens correlated with lymph node metastazation of breast cancer. All three conserved domains in TP53 were mutated in lymph node-negative breast cancers, whereas only one domain was mutated in lymph node-positive samples. Mutations in microtubule-related proteins appear to help immune cells recognize tumors and inhibit their lymph node metastasis. Destroying microtubule-related proteins is a potential therapeutic strategy to inhibit lymph node metastasis of breast cancer. As the neoantigens specifically present in lymph node-positive breast cancers, MAPK10, BC9L, TRIM65, CD93, KITLG, CNPPD1, CPED1, CCDC146, TMEM185A, INO80D, and PSMD11 are potential targets for vaccine design. In the tumor microenvironment, reduced numbers of effector immune cells, especially activated memory CD4+ T cells and activated mast cells, facilitate breast cancer metastasis to the lymph nodes. According to transcriptome data, lymph node metastasis was mostly driven by gene mutation rather than by gene expression. Although differential gene expression analysis was based on lymph node metastasis status, many genes were shown to be differentially expressed based on estrogen receptor status. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Fibroblasts turn into cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumour microenvironment. CAFs have recently attracted attention for their function as a regulator of immune cell recruitment and function in addition to their tumour-promoting roles. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of CAFs on monocyte recruitment and macrophage polarization in breast cancer. CAFs, which were α-SMA expressing fibroblasts in contrast to normal fibroblasts (NFs), effectively recruited monocytes. Recruitment of monocytes by CAFs might be mediated by monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) as well as stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) cytokines. CAFs differentiated the recruited monocytes into M2-like macrophages which are capable of exerting their immunosuppressive roles via the PD-1 axis. CAF-educated monocytes exhibited strong immune suppression unlike NF-educated monocytes and enhanced the motility/invasion of breast cancer cells in addition to increasing the expressions of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes and vimentin protein in cancer cells. CAF-educated M1 macrophages displayed increased expression of M2 markers and production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in contrast to decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12 compared with control M1 macrophages; suggesting that CAFs were also able to induce the trans-differentiation of M1 macrophages to M2 macrophages. We then investigated the relationship between the infiltration of CAFs and tumour associated macrophages (TAMs) using tissue samples obtained from breast cancer patients. High grade of CAFs significantly correlated with the number of TAMs in human breast cancer tissue samples. It was also associated with higher Ki-67 proliferation index, and higher tumour volume. This result is in line with our finding of increased breast cancer cell proliferation due to the effects of CAF-educated monocytes in vitro. Our results concluded that CAFs play pivotal roles in sculpturing the tumour microenvironment in breast cancer, and therapeutic strategies to reverse the CAF-mediated immunosuppressive microenvironment should be taken into consideration. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

We construct iCells of four cancers and the corresponding tissue controls and identify the most rewired genes in cancer.

We biologically validate that they have a role in cancer by knockdown experiments followed by cell viability assays.

Our method achieves an accuracy of 96% for RNA-seq and 95% for mixed DNA-seq and RNA-seq identification. Even for a panel of only 94 cancer-related genes, accuracy remains at 82% but decreases when using smaller panels.

The angular spectra of scattering coefficient maps of normal tissues exhibit a spatial feature distinct from those of abnormal tissues. An angular spectrum index to quantify the differences between the normal and abnormal tissues is derived, and its strength in revealing subsurface cancer in ex vivo samples is statistically analyzed.

        fabio:abstract    "Metastatic colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer death. Current options in palliation such as hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) present severe side effects. Recent research efforts suggested the therapeutic use of oxidant-enriched liquid using cold physical plasma. To investigate a clinically accepted treatment regimen, we assessed the antitumor capacity of plasma-treated saline solution. In response to such liquid, CT26 murine colon cancer cells were readily oxidized and showed cell growth with subsequent apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and upregulation of immunogenic cell death (ICD) markers in vitro. This was accompanied by marked morphological changes with re-arrangement of actin fibers and reduced motility. Induction of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype was not observed. Key results were confirmed in MC38 colon and PDA6606 pancreatic cancer cells. Compared to plasma-treated saline, hydrogen peroxide was inferiorly toxic in 3D tumor spheroids but of similar efficacy in 2D models. In vivo, plasma-treated saline decreased tumor burden in Balb/C mice. This was concomitant with elevated numbers of intratumoral macrophages and increased T cell activation following incubation with CT26 cells ex vivo. Being a potential adjuvant for HIPEC therapy, our results suggest oxidizing saline solutions to inactivate colon cancer cells while potentially stimulating antitumor immune responses. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Although solid fuel combustion emissions are known to increase the prevalence of illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer, however, their effect on the eyes is underexplored. This study assesses the acute toxicity of solid fuel combustion emissions on healthy ocular cells and a cancer cell line. Three healthy ocular cell lines (corneal, lens, and retinal epithelial cells) and a cancer cell line (Chinese hamster ovary cells) were exposed to liquid and gas phase emissions from applewood and coal combustion. Following the exposure, real-time cell attachment behavior was monitored for at least 120 hours with electrical cell impedance spectroscopy. The viability of the cells, amount of apoptotic cells, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were quantified with MTT, ApoTox-Glo, and ROS-Glo H 2 O 2 assays, respectively. The results showed that coal emissions compromised the viability of ocular cells more than applewood emissions. Interestingly, the cancer cells, although their viability was not compromised, generated 1.7 to 2.7 times more ROS than healthy cells. This acute exposure study provides compelling proof that biomass combustion emissions compromise the viability of ocular cells and increase ROS generation. The increased ROS generation was fatal for ocular cells, but it promoted the growth of cancer cells. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) include endogenous metabolites that provide information about health and disease which might be useful to develop a better screening method for breast cancer. The goal of this study was to classify mice with and without tumors and compare tumors localized to the mammary pad and tumor cells injected into the iliac artery by differences in VOCs in urine. After 4T1.2 tumor cells were injected into BALB/c mice either in the mammary pad or into the iliac artery, urine was collected, VOCs from urine headspace were concentrated by solid phase microextraction and results were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry quadrupole time-of-flight. Multivariate and univariate statistical analyses were employed to find potential biomarkers for breast cancer and metastatic breast cancer in mice models. A set of six VOCs classified mice with and without tumors with an area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC AUC) of 0.98 (95% confidence interval [0.85, 1.00]) via five-fold cross validation. Classification of mice with tumors in the mammary pad and iliac artery was executed utilizing a different set of six VOCs, with a ROC AUC of 0.96 (95% confidence interval [0.75, 1.00]). © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

In an additional two metastatic colon cancer patients, we detected CD8 + neoantigen-specific cells targeting the mutated SMAD5 and MUC4 proteins.

Moreover, the high drug loading capacity of Cet-SLN was employed to encapsulate photothermal agent indocyanine green (ICG) to finally fabricate a versatile drug delivery system (DDS) able to co-deliver Cet and ICG (Cet-SLN/ICG) for combinational chemo-photothermal therapy of breast cancer. The obtained results clearly demonstrated that Cet-SLN/ICG was well-dispersed nanoparticles with preferable stability under physiological condition. Furthermore, due to the conjugation of Cet, Cet-SLN/ICG could target EGFR which overexpress in MCF-7 cells. Most importantly, both in vitro and in vivo results suggested that compared with Cet or ICG alone, the Cet-SLN/ICG showed superior anticancer efficacy. In conclusion, Cet-SLN/ICG could be a potential platform for effective combinational chemo-photothermal therapy for breast cancer." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The integration of genomic and DNA methylation data has been demonstrated as a powerful strategy in understanding cancer mechanisms and identifying therapeutic targets. The TCGA consortium has mapped DNA methylation in thousands of cancer samples using Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 K BeadChip (Illumina 450 K array) that only covers about 1.5% of CpGs in the human genome. Therefore, increasing the coverage of the DNA methylome would significantly leverage the usage of the TCGA data. Here, we present a new model called EAGLING that can expand the Illumina 450 K array data 18 times to cover about 30% of the CpGs in the human genome. We applied it to analyze 13 cancers in TCGA. By integrating the expanded methylation, gene expression, and somatic mutation data, we identified the genes showing differential patterns in each of the 13 cancers. Many of the triple-evidenced genes identified in majority of the cancers are biomarkers or potential biomarkers. Pan-cancer analysis also revealed the pathways in which the triple-evidenced genes are enriched, which include well known ones as well as new ones, such as axonal guidance signaling pathway and pathways related to inflammatory processing or inflammation response. Triple-evidenced genes, particularly TNXB, RRM2, CELSR3, SLC16A3, FANCI, MMP9, MMP11, SIK1, and TRIM59 showed superior predictive power in both tumor diagnosis and prognosis. These results have demonstrated that the integrative analysis using the expanded methylation data is powerful in identifying critical genes/pathways that may serve as new therapeutic targets. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

However, macrophages make up a majority of immune cell infiltrates into tumors, creating natural targets for immunotherapies able to direct macrophages away from tumor-supportive functions and toward anti-tumor phenotypes. Recent studies demonstrate that toll-like receptors (TLRs) – pathways that quickly trigger early immune responses – play an important role in polarizing macrophages. Here, we present emerging ways in which TLR signaling is being manipulated in macrophages to create new opportunities for cancer immunotherapy. In particular, we discuss approaches to deliver TLR agonists, to leverage biomaterials in these therapies, and to couple TLR-based approaches with other frontline treatments as combination cancer therapies. © 2018" ;

We analyzed the immune profiles, T cell cytotoxicity, and TCR repertoire of peripheral blood, normal lung tissue, and tumor tissue from NSCLC patients. By using bispecific T-cell engager technology to assess the cytotoxicity of T cells, we found that the cytotoxicity of tumor-infiltrated T cells closely correlated with that of peripheral T cells. This correlation was supported by the immune profiles, cytokine production, and results of the TCR repertoire analysis from these specimens. We also found that the cytotoxicity of peripheral T cells has potential as a predictor of the effects of nivolumab in the tumor microenvironment.

This standard procedure relies on the slow radioactivity loss, usually attributed to the limited tumour expression of G6P-phosphatase (G6Pase). However, this classical interpretation intrinsically represents an approximation since, as in all tissues, cancer G6Pase activity is remarkable and is confined to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whose lumen must be reached by phosphorylated FDG to explain its hydrolysis and radioactivity release. The present study tested the impact of G6Pase sequestration on the mathematical description of FDG trafficking and handling in cultured cancer cells. Our data show that accounting for tracer access to the ER configures this compartment as the preferential site of FDG accumulation. This is confirmed by the reticular localization of fluorescent FDG analogues. Remarkably enough, reticular accumulation rate of FDG is dependent upon extracellular glucose availability, thus configuring the same ER as a significant determinant of cancer glucose metabolism. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Although current methods of treatment for cervical cancer can ablate lesions, preventing metastatic disseminations and excessive tissue injuries still remains a major concern. Hence, development of a safer and more efficient treatment modality is of vital importance. Natural products from plants are one of the principal sources of precursors to lead compounds with direct pharmaceutical application across all disease classes. One of these plants is Ficus carica, whose fruit latex, when applied on HPV-induced skin warts, has shown potential as a possible cure for this virus related lesions. This study explores the in vitro biological activities of fig latex and elucidates its possible mechanisms of action on cervical cancer cell lines CaSki and HeLa positive for HPV type 16 and 18, respectively. Our data shows that fig latex inhibits properties that are associated with HPV-positive cervical cancer transformed cells such as rapid growth and invasion and substantially downregulated the expression of p16 and HPV onco-proteins E6, E7. These findings suggest Ficus carica latex has the potential to be used in the development of therapeutic modalities for the possible treatment, cure and prevention of HPV related cervical cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing methods, the diversity and composition of the microbiota from ovarian cancer tissues (25 samples) and normal distal fallopian tube tissues (25 samples) were analyzed. High-throughput sequencing showed that the diversity and richness indexes were significantly decreased in ovarian cancer tissues compared to tissues from normal distal fallopian tubes. The ratio of the two phyla for Proteobacteria/Firmicutes was notably increased in ovarian cancer, which revealed that microbial composition change might be associated with the process of ovarian cancer development. In addition, transcriptome-sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses suggested that the transcriptional profiles were statistically different between ovarian carcinoma and normal distal fallopian tubes. Moreover, a set of genes including 84 different inflammation-associated or immune-associated genes, which had been named as the human antibacterial-response genes were also modulated expression.

        fabio:abstract    "Several pioneering work have established that apart from genetic alterations, epigenetic modifications contribute significantly in tumor progression. Remarkable role of EZH2 in cancer highlights the importance of identifying its targets. Although much emphasis has been placed in recent years in designing drugs and inhibitors targeting EZH2, less effort has been given in exploring its existing targets that will help in understanding the oncogenic role of EZH2 in turn which may provide a more stringent method of targeting EZH2. In the present study, we validated six direct targets of EZH2 that are GPNMB, PMEPA1, CoL5A1, VGLL4, POMT2 and SUMF1 associated with cancer related pathways. Upon EZH2 knockdown, more than two fold increase in the target gene expression was evident. CHIP-qPCR performed in both MCF-7 and MDA-MDA-231 confirmed the in-vivo binding of EZH2 on its identified target. Thirty invasive breast carcinoma cases with their adjacent normal tissues were included in the study. Immunohistochemistry in primary breast tumor tissue array showed tumor dependent expression of EZH2. Array of MERAV expression database revealed the strength of association of EZH2 with its target genes. Real time PCR performed with RNA extracted from breast tumor tissues further authenticated the existing negative correlation between EZH2 and its target genes. Pearson correlation coefficient & statistical significance computed using the matrix provided in the database strengthened the negative correlation between identified target genes and EZH2. KM plotter analysis showed improved relapse-free survival with increased expression of PMEPA1, POMT2, VGLL4 and SUMF1 in breast cancer patients indicating their therapeutic potential. While investigating the relevance of these target genes, different mutations of them were found in breast cancer patients. Seeking the clinical relevance of our study, following our recent publication that reports the role of EZH2 in nicotine-mediated breast cancer development and progression, we observed significant reduced expression of SUMF1 in breast cancer patient samples with smoking history in comparison to never-smoked patient samples. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we report that TOP1MT is overexpressed in cancer tissues and demonstrate that TOP1MT deficiency attenuates tumor growth in human and mouse models of colon and liver cancer. Due to their mitochondrial dysfunction, TOP1MT-KO cells become addicted to glycolysis, which limits synthetic building blocks and energy supply required for the proliferation of cancer cells in a nutrient-deprived tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, we show that TOP1MT associates with mitoribosomal subunits, ensuring optimal mitochondrial translation and assembly of oxidative phosphorylation complexes that are critical for sustaining tumor growth. The TOP1MT genomic signature profile, based on Top1mt-KO liver cancers, is correlated with enhanced survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Our results highlight the importance of TOP1MT for tumor development, providing a potential rationale to develop TOP1MT-targeted drugs as anticancer therapies. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

A new data integrative approach, based on graphical models, was applied on our multi-modal –omics, and clinical data cohort of metastatic melanoma patients. We found that response to chemotherapy is directly linked to ten gene expression, four methylation variables and PARP1 SNP rs1805407. PARP1 is a DNA repair gene critical for chemotherapy response and for which FDA-approved inhibitors are clinically available (olaparib). We demonstrated that two PARP inhibitors (ABT-888 and olaparib) make SNP carrier cancer cells of various histologic subtypes more sensitive to alkylating agents, but they have no effect in wild-type cells. Furthermore, PARP1 inhibitors act synergistically with chemotherapy in SNP carrier cells (especially in ovarian cancer for which olaparib is FDA-approved), but they are additive at best in wild-type cancer cells. Taken together, our results suggest that the combination of chemotherapy and PARP1 inhibition may benefit the carriers of rs1805407 in the future and may be used in personalized therapy strategies to select patients that are more likely to respond to PARP inhibitors. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Cancer remains one of the biggest threats to human society. There are massive demands for compounds to selectively kill cancerous cells. Earlier studies have shown that bovine α -lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells (BAMLET) becomes cytotoxic against cancer cells in complex with oleic acid {Hoque, M. et. al., PLoSOne8, e68390 (2013)}. In our study, we obtained bovine α-lactalbumin complexed with lanthanum ion (La 3+ -B-α-LA) and determined its high resolution crystal structure. The natural calcium binding site of bovine α-lactalbumin is replaced by lanthanum. The La 3+ complex formation by B-α-apo-LA was also supported by various biophysical methods. Interestingly, our complex, La 3+ -B-α-LA exhibits much greater anticancer activity against breast cancer cells as compared to the reported BAMLET-oleic acid complex. This study shows that La 3+ -B-α-LA complex is preferentially more toxic to MCF-7 cells as compared to KB (oral cancer) and HeLa (cervical) cells, while almost non-toxic to the healthy cells that we studied. Our data indicates that the cytotoxicity of La 3+ -B-α-LA against cancer cells is through apoptotic path way. The higher anticancer activity of La 3+ -B-α-LA is attributable to the requisite structural changes induced in the protein by La 3+ binding as supported by the crystal structure of the complex. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

However, no studies have evaluated vascular pain in patients with colorectal cancer in relation to peripheral venous administration of chemotherapy with or without oxaliplatin. We evaluated oxaliplatin-induced vascular pain using subjective and objective methods. We determined if oxaliplatin induced vascular pain in patients with colorectal cancer using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and a PainVision PS-2100 device. We compared VAS score between chemotherapy regimens with or without oxaliplatin, and between genders. We also examined the correlations of VAS score with pain intensity examined by the PainVision PS-2100, and with age and vessel diameter. A total of 98 patients with colorectal cancer were enrolled in this study, including 78 patients who received oxaliplatin via peripheral venous administration and 20 who received chemotherapy without oxaliplatin. The median VAS scores in patients with and without oxaliplatin were 36.5 (interquartile range 9.0–60.0) and 0 (0–4.0), respectively (P < 0.001), and the median pain intensities according to PainVision were 43.5 (14.3–98) and 36.5 (9.3–58.5), respectively (P < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between VAS and pain intensity (r = 0.584), but no correlation between VAS score and age (r = −0.174) or vessel diameter (r = −0.107).

One of the emerging techniques with tremendous power for lung cancer therapy is magnetic aerosol drug targeting (MADT). The use of a permanent magnet for effective drug delivery in a desired location throughout the lung requires extensive optimization, but it has not been addressed yet. In the present study, the possibility of using a permanent magnet for trapping the particles on a lung tumor is evaluated numerically in the Weibel's model from G0 to G3. The effect of different parameters is considered on the efficiency of particle deposition in a tumor located on a distant position of the lung bronchi and bronchioles. Also, the effective position of the magnetic source, tumor size, and location are the objectives for particle deposition. The results show that a limited particle deposition occurs on the lung branches in passive targeting. However, the incorporation of a permanent magnet next to the tumor enhanced the particle deposition fraction on G2 to up to 49% for the particles of 7 µm diameter. Optimizing the magnet size could also improve the particle deposition fraction by 68%. It was also shown that the utilization of MADT is essential for effective drug delivery to the tumors located on the lower wall of airway branches given the dominance of the air velocity and resultant drag force in this region. The results demonstrated the high competence and necessity of MADT as a noninvasive drug delivery method for lung cancer therapy." ;

Adjuvant chemotherapy has significantly reduced mortality but increased cognitive impairments, including attention function, making quality of life issues a crucial concern. This study enrolled nineteen breast cancer patients who were treated with standard chemotherapy within 6 months and 20 sex-matched healthy controls to investigate the brain effects of chemotherapy. All participants underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) with mean fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (mfALFF) analysis and were correlated with neuropsychological tests, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised (CAMS-R), and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), to explore the possible underlying mechanism of cognitive alternations. We found increased mfALFF over the frontoparietal lobe and decreased mfALFF over the occipital lobe in the cancer patients compared with the healthy controls; the altered brain regions may be associated with the dorsal attention network (DAN) and may be explained by a compensatory mechanism. Both MMSE and CAMS-R scores showed a positive correlation with mfALFF in the occipital lobe but a negative correlation in the frontoparietal lobe. By contrast, IES-R scores showed a positive correlation with mfALFF in the frontoparietal lobe but a negative correlation in the occipital lobe. These alterations are potentially related to the effects of both chemotherapy and psychological distress.

Mutations that occur in certain splicing factor genes themselves have been implicated in many cancers, particularly myelodysplastic syndromes. Small molecules that target splicing factors have been developed as therapies to preferentially induce apoptosis in these cancer cells.

There have been many attempts to identify markers and key pathways induced throughout EMT but the process is complex and depends on the cancer type and tumour microenvironment. Here we used the colon cancer cell line HT29, which stably overexpressed Snail, the key transcription factor in early EMT, as a model for colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with a pro-metastatic phenotype. We investigated miRNA expression regulation during that phenotypic switching. We found that overexpression of Snail in HT29 cells triggered significant changes in individual miRNA levels but did not change the global efficiency of miRNA processing. Snail abundance repressed the expression of miR-192 and miR-194 and increased miR-205, let-7i and SNORD13 levels. These identified changes correlated with the reported transcriptomic alterations in Snail-overexpressing HT29 cells. We also investigated how Snail affected the miRNA content of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from HT29 cells.

        fabio:abstract    "Solid malignancies are associated with the development of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP). This study aimed to evaluate the risk factors for PJP among patients with lung cancer. This retrospective case-control study compared patients who had lung cancer with PJP (n = 112) or without PJP (n = 336) matched according to age, sex, histopathology, and stage. PJP definition was based on (i) positive PCR or direct immunofluorescence results for pneumocystis, (ii) clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities that were consistent with a pneumonic process, and (iii) received targeted PJP treatment. The development of PJP was associated with radiotherapy (RTx), concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRTx), lymphopenia, and prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (20 mg of prednisolone equivalent per day for ≥3 weeks). Multivariate analysis revealed independent associations with prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06–3.63; p = 0.032) and CCRTx (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.27–3.43; p = 0.004). Steroid use was frequently related to RTx pneumonitis or esophagitis (29 patients, 43.3%). Prolonged high-dose steroid therapy and CCRTx were risk factors for PJP development among patients with lung cancer. As these patients had a poor prognosis, clinicians should consider PJP prophylaxis for high-risk patients with lung cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we compared The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) breast cancer genomic datasets (array and next generation sequencing (NGS) data) in detecting genomic alterations in clinically relevant genes. We performed an in silico analysis to determine the concordance in the frequencies of actionable mutations and copy number alterations/aberrations (CNAs) in the two most common breast cancer histologies, invasive lobular and invasive ductal carcinoma. We found that targeted sequencing identified a larger number of mutational hotspots and clinically significant amplifications that would have been missed by WES and SNP arrays in many actionable genes such as PIK3CA, EGFR, AKT3, FGFR1, ERBB2, ERBB3 and ESR1. The striking differences between the number of mutational hotspots and CNAs generated from these platforms highlight a number of factors that should be considered in the interpretation of array and NGS-based genomic data for precision medicine. Targeted panel sequencing was preferable to WES to define the full spectrum of somatic mutations present in a tumor. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Several oxaliplatin transporters were previously identified but their relative contributions to determining oxaliplatin tumour responses and gastrointestinal tumour cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin remains unclear. We studied clinical associations between tumour expression of oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes and patient response to oxaliplatin, then experimentally verified associations found with MRP2 in models of human gastrointestinal cancer. Among 18 oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes, MRP2 was the only one to be differentially expressed in the tumours of colorectal cancer patients who did or did not respond to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Over-expression of MRP2 (endogenously in HepG2 and PANC-1 cells, or induced by stable transfection of HEK293 cells) decreased oxaliplatin accumulation and cytotoxicity but those deficits were reversed by inhibition of MRP2 with myricetin or siRNA knockdown. Mice bearing subcutaneous HepG2 tumour xenografts were sensitised to oxaliplatin antitumour activity by concurrent myricetin treatment with little or no increase in toxicity. In conclusion, MRP2 limits oxaliplatin accumulation and response in human gastrointestinal cancer. Screening tumour MRP2 expression levels, to select patients for treatment with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy alone or in combination with a MRP2 inhibitor, could improve treatment outcomes. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

We compare optimized gene signatures for cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin responses in the same cell lines and validate each signature using data from patients with cancer. Supervised support vector machine learning is used to derive gene sets whose expression is related to the cell line GI50 values by backwards feature selection with cross-validation. Specific genes and functional pathways distinguishing sensitive from resistant cell lines are identified by contrasting signatures obtained at extreme and median GI50 thresholds. Ensembles of gene signatures at different thresholds are combined to reduce the dependence on specific GI50 values for predicting drug responses. The most accurate gene signatures for each platin are: cisplatin: BARD1, BCL2, BCL2L1, CDKN2C, FAAP24, FEN1, MAP3K1, MAPK13, MAPK3, NFKB1, NFKB2, SLC22A5, SLC31A2, TLR4, and TWIST1; carboplatin: AKT1, EIF3K, ERCC1, GNGT1, GSR, MTHFR, NEDD4L, NLRP1, NRAS, RAF1, SGK1, TIGD1, TP53, VEGFB, and VEGFC; and oxaliplatin: BRAF, FCGR2A, IGF1, MSH2, NAGK, NFE2L2, NQO1, PANK3, SLC47A1, SLCO1B1, and UGT1A1. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with bladder, ovarian, and colorectal cancer were used to test the cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin signatures, resulting in 71.0%, 60.2%, and 54.5% accuracies in predicting disease recurrence and 59%, 61%, and 72% accuracies in predicting remission, respectively. One cisplatin signature predicted 100% of recurrence in non-smoking patients with bladder cancer (57% disease-free; N = 19), and 79% recurrence in smokers (62% disease-free; N = 35).

MTH1 dephosphorylates oxidized nucleotides, thereby preventing their incorporation into DNA and protecting tumour cells from oxidative DNA damage. Inhibitors of MTH1 (TH588 and (S)-crizotinib) were shown to reduce cancer cell viability. However, the MTH1-dependency of the anti-cancer effects of these drugs has recently been questioned. Here, we have assessed anti-tumour effects of TH588 and (S)-crizotinib in patient-derived 3D colorectal cancer cultures. Hypoxia and reoxygenation – conditions that increase intracellular ROS levels – increased sensitivity to (S)-crizotinib, but not to TH588. (S)-crizotinib reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-MET and ErbB3 whereas TH588 induced a mitotic cell cycle arrest, which was not affected by adding ROS-modulating compounds. Furthermore, we show that both compounds induced DNA damage that could not be prevented by adding the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Moreover, adding ROS-modulating compounds did not alter the reduction in viability in response to TH588 and (S)-crizotinib. We conclude that TH588 and (S)-crizotinib have very clear and distinct anti-tumour effects in 3D colorectal cancer cultures, but that these effects most likely occur through distinct and ROS-independent mechanisms. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Histological iron imaging and contrast-agent free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect these deposits, but their presence in human cancer, and correlation with immunotherapeutic response is largely untested. Here, primarily using these iron imaging approaches, we evaluated the spatial distribution of polarized macrophage populations containing high endogenous levels of iron in preclinical murine models and human breast cancer, and used them as metabolic biomarkers to correlate TAM infiltration with response to immunotherapy in preclinical trials. Macrophage-targeted inhibition of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) by immunotherapy was confirmed to inhibit macrophage accumulation and slow mammary tumor growth in mouse models while also reducing hemosiderin iron-laden TAM accumulation as measured by both iron histology and in vivo iron MRI (FeMRI). Spatial profiling of TAM iron deposit infiltration defined regions of maximal accumulation and response to the CSF1R inhibitor, and revealed differences between microenvironments of human cancer according to levels of polarized macrophage iron accumulation in stromal margins. We therefore demonstrate that iron deposition serves as an endogenous metabolic imaging biomarker of TAM infiltration in breast cancer that has high translational potential for evaluation of immunotherapeutic response. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

The AP2 family also acts as a tumor suppressor. Here we found that p73 and AP2 are able to activate NEU4, a neuraminidase gene, which removes the terminal sialic acid residues from cancer-associated glycans. Under serum starvation, NEU4 was up-regulated and one of the NEU4 target glycans, sialyl Lewis X, was decreased, whereas p73 and AP2 were up-regulated. Sialyl Lewis X levels were not, however, decreased under starvation conditions in p73- or AP2-knockdown cells. p53 and AP2 underwent protein-protein interactions, exerting synergistic effects to activate p21, and interaction of p53 with AP2 was lost in cells expressing the L350P mutation of p53. The homologous residues in p63 and p73 are L423 and L377, respectively. The synergistic effect of p53/p63 with AP2 to activate genes was lost with the L350P/L423P mutation in p53/p63, but p73 bearing the L377P mutation was able to interact with AP2 and exerted its normal synergistic effects. We propose that p73 and AP2 synergistically activate the NEU4 promoter in colon cancer cells. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Treatment with increasing concentrations of HspNPs (25, 50, 75 and 100 µg/mL) resulted in 9.1-, 7-, 12.5- and 12.7-fold in increase in apoptotic cell number. Optimum doses of Hsp and HspNPs were found to increase oxidative damage in C6 glioma cells. MDA levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were found to be significantly elevated at 75 and 100 µg/mL exposure concentration of HspNPs with (p = .002) and (p = .018), respectively for 48-h treatment.

GO exhibits pH-dependent fluorescence emission in the visible/near-infrared, providing a possibility of molecular imaging and pH-sensing. It is also water soluble and has a substantial platform for functionalization, allowing for the delivery of multiple therapeutics. GO physical properties are modified to enhance cellular internalization, producing fluorescent nanoflakes with low (<15%) cytotoxicity at the imaging concentrations of 15 μg/mL. As a result, at lower flake sizes GO rapidly internalizes into HeLa cells with the following 70% fluorescence based clearance at 24 h, assessed by its characteristic emission in red/near-IR. pH-dependence of GO emission is utilized to provide the sensing of acidic extracellular environments of cancer cells. The results demonstrate diminishing green/red (550/630 nm) fluorescence intensity ratios for HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells in comparison to HEK-293 healthy cells suggesting a potential use of GO as a non-invasive optical sensor for cancer microenvironments.

        fabio:abstract    "Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells, represents early stages of metastasis and is a promising target in colorectal cancer (CRC) therapy. There have been many attempts to identify markers and key pathways induced throughout EMT but the process is complex and depends on the cancer type and tumour microenvironment. Here we used the colon cancer cell line HT29, which stably overexpressed Snail, the key transcription factor in early EMT, as a model for colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with a pro-metastatic phenotype. We investigated miRNA expression regulation during that phenotypic switching. We found that overexpression of Snail in HT29 cells triggered significant changes in individual miRNA levels but did not change the global efficiency of miRNA processing. Snail abundance repressed the expression of miR-192 and miR-194 and increased miR-205, let-7i and SNORD13 levels. These identified changes correlated with the reported transcriptomic alterations in Snail-overexpressing HT29 cells. We also investigated how Snail affected the miRNA content of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from HT29 cells. Our data suggest that the presence of Snail significantly alters the complex mRNA/miRNA interactions in the early steps of metastasis and also has an impact on the content of EVs released from HT29 cells. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Solid malignancies are associated with the development of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP). This study aimed to evaluate the risk factors for PJP among patients with lung cancer. This retrospective case-control study compared patients who had lung cancer with PJP (n = 112) or without PJP (n = 336) matched according to age, sex, histopathology, and stage. PJP definition was based on (i) positive PCR or direct immunofluorescence results for pneumocystis, (ii) clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities that were consistent with a pneumonic process, and (iii) received targeted PJP treatment. The development of PJP was associated with radiotherapy (RTx), concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRTx), lymphopenia, and prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (20 mg of prednisolone equivalent per day for ≥3 weeks). Multivariate analysis revealed independent associations with prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06–3.63; p = 0.032) and CCRTx (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.27–3.43; p = 0.004). Steroid use was frequently related to RTx pneumonitis or esophagitis (29 patients, 43.3%). Prolonged high-dose steroid therapy and CCRTx were risk factors for PJP development among patients with lung cancer. As these patients had a poor prognosis, clinicians should consider PJP prophylaxis for high-risk patients with lung cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we compared The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) breast cancer genomic datasets (array and next generation sequencing (NGS) data) in detecting genomic alterations in clinically relevant genes. We performed an in silico analysis to determine the concordance in the frequencies of actionable mutations and copy number alterations/aberrations (CNAs) in the two most common breast cancer histologies, invasive lobular and invasive ductal carcinoma. We found that targeted sequencing identified a larger number of mutational hotspots and clinically significant amplifications that would have been missed by WES and SNP arrays in many actionable genes such as PIK3CA, EGFR, AKT3, FGFR1, ERBB2, ERBB3 and ESR1. The striking differences between the number of mutational hotspots and CNAs generated from these platforms highlight a number of factors that should be considered in the interpretation of array and NGS-based genomic data for precision medicine. Targeted panel sequencing was preferable to WES to define the full spectrum of somatic mutations present in a tumor. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Several oxaliplatin transporters were previously identified but their relative contributions to determining oxaliplatin tumour responses and gastrointestinal tumour cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin remains unclear. We studied clinical associations between tumour expression of oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes and patient response to oxaliplatin, then experimentally verified associations found with MRP2 in models of human gastrointestinal cancer. Among 18 oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes, MRP2 was the only one to be differentially expressed in the tumours of colorectal cancer patients who did or did not respond to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Over-expression of MRP2 (endogenously in HepG2 and PANC-1 cells, or induced by stable transfection of HEK293 cells) decreased oxaliplatin accumulation and cytotoxicity but those deficits were reversed by inhibition of MRP2 with myricetin or siRNA knockdown. Mice bearing subcutaneous HepG2 tumour xenografts were sensitised to oxaliplatin antitumour activity by concurrent myricetin treatment with little or no increase in toxicity. In conclusion, MRP2 limits oxaliplatin accumulation and response in human gastrointestinal cancer. Screening tumour MRP2 expression levels, to select patients for treatment with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy alone or in combination with a MRP2 inhibitor, could improve treatment outcomes. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

We compare optimized gene signatures for cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin responses in the same cell lines and validate each signature using data from patients with cancer. Supervised support vector machine learning is used to derive gene sets whose expression is related to the cell line GI50 values by backwards feature selection with cross-validation. Specific genes and functional pathways distinguishing sensitive from resistant cell lines are identified by contrasting signatures obtained at extreme and median GI50 thresholds. Ensembles of gene signatures at different thresholds are combined to reduce the dependence on specific GI50 values for predicting drug responses. The most accurate gene signatures for each platin are: cisplatin: BARD1, BCL2, BCL2L1, CDKN2C, FAAP24, FEN1, MAP3K1, MAPK13, MAPK3, NFKB1, NFKB2, SLC22A5, SLC31A2, TLR4, and TWIST1; carboplatin: AKT1, EIF3K, ERCC1, GNGT1, GSR, MTHFR, NEDD4L, NLRP1, NRAS, RAF1, SGK1, TIGD1, TP53, VEGFB, and VEGFC; and oxaliplatin: BRAF, FCGR2A, IGF1, MSH2, NAGK, NFE2L2, NQO1, PANK3, SLC47A1, SLCO1B1, and UGT1A1. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with bladder, ovarian, and colorectal cancer were used to test the cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin signatures, resulting in 71.0%, 60.2%, and 54.5% accuracies in predicting disease recurrence and 59%, 61%, and 72% accuracies in predicting remission, respectively. One cisplatin signature predicted 100% of recurrence in non-smoking patients with bladder cancer (57% disease-free; N = 19), and 79% recurrence in smokers (62% disease-free; N = 35).

MTH1 dephosphorylates oxidized nucleotides, thereby preventing their incorporation into DNA and protecting tumour cells from oxidative DNA damage. Inhibitors of MTH1 (TH588 and (S)-crizotinib) were shown to reduce cancer cell viability. However, the MTH1-dependency of the anti-cancer effects of these drugs has recently been questioned. Here, we have assessed anti-tumour effects of TH588 and (S)-crizotinib in patient-derived 3D colorectal cancer cultures. Hypoxia and reoxygenation – conditions that increase intracellular ROS levels – increased sensitivity to (S)-crizotinib, but not to TH588. (S)-crizotinib reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-MET and ErbB3 whereas TH588 induced a mitotic cell cycle arrest, which was not affected by adding ROS-modulating compounds. Furthermore, we show that both compounds induced DNA damage that could not be prevented by adding the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Moreover, adding ROS-modulating compounds did not alter the reduction in viability in response to TH588 and (S)-crizotinib. We conclude that TH588 and (S)-crizotinib have very clear and distinct anti-tumour effects in 3D colorectal cancer cultures, but that these effects most likely occur through distinct and ROS-independent mechanisms. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Histological iron imaging and contrast-agent free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect these deposits, but their presence in human cancer, and correlation with immunotherapeutic response is largely untested. Here, primarily using these iron imaging approaches, we evaluated the spatial distribution of polarized macrophage populations containing high endogenous levels of iron in preclinical murine models and human breast cancer, and used them as metabolic biomarkers to correlate TAM infiltration with response to immunotherapy in preclinical trials. Macrophage-targeted inhibition of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) by immunotherapy was confirmed to inhibit macrophage accumulation and slow mammary tumor growth in mouse models while also reducing hemosiderin iron-laden TAM accumulation as measured by both iron histology and in vivo iron MRI (FeMRI). Spatial profiling of TAM iron deposit infiltration defined regions of maximal accumulation and response to the CSF1R inhibitor, and revealed differences between microenvironments of human cancer according to levels of polarized macrophage iron accumulation in stromal margins. We therefore demonstrate that iron deposition serves as an endogenous metabolic imaging biomarker of TAM infiltration in breast cancer that has high translational potential for evaluation of immunotherapeutic response. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

The AP2 family also acts as a tumor suppressor. Here we found that p73 and AP2 are able to activate NEU4, a neuraminidase gene, which removes the terminal sialic acid residues from cancer-associated glycans. Under serum starvation, NEU4 was up-regulated and one of the NEU4 target glycans, sialyl Lewis X, was decreased, whereas p73 and AP2 were up-regulated. Sialyl Lewis X levels were not, however, decreased under starvation conditions in p73- or AP2-knockdown cells. p53 and AP2 underwent protein-protein interactions, exerting synergistic effects to activate p21, and interaction of p53 with AP2 was lost in cells expressing the L350P mutation of p53. The homologous residues in p63 and p73 are L423 and L377, respectively. The synergistic effect of p53/p63 with AP2 to activate genes was lost with the L350P/L423P mutation in p53/p63, but p73 bearing the L377P mutation was able to interact with AP2 and exerted its normal synergistic effects. We propose that p73 and AP2 synergistically activate the NEU4 promoter in colon cancer cells. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Treatment of C6 glioma cells with HspNPs for 24 and 48 h resulted in dose- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability, with approximate IC50 of 28 and 21 μg/mL, respectively (p = .036 for 24 h, p = .025 for 48 h). The percentage of PCNA positive cells decreased to 20% and 10%, respectively, for Hsp- and HspNP-treated cells at concentration of 100 µg/mL. Treatment with increasing concentrations of HspNPs (25, 50, 75 and 100 µg/mL) resulted in 9.1-, 7-, 12.5- and 12.7-fold in increase in apoptotic cell number. Optimum doses of Hsp and HspNPs were found to increase oxidative damage in C6 glioma cells. MDA levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were found to be significantly elevated at 75 and 100 µg/mL exposure concentration of HspNPs with (p = .002) and (p = .018), respectively for 48-h treatment.

GO exhibits pH-dependent fluorescence emission in the visible/near-infrared, providing a possibility of molecular imaging and pH-sensing. It is also water soluble and has a substantial platform for functionalization, allowing for the delivery of multiple therapeutics. GO physical properties are modified to enhance cellular internalization, producing fluorescent nanoflakes with low (<15%) cytotoxicity at the imaging concentrations of 15 μg/mL. As a result, at lower flake sizes GO rapidly internalizes into HeLa cells with the following 70% fluorescence based clearance at 24 h, assessed by its characteristic emission in red/near-IR. pH-dependence of GO emission is utilized to provide the sensing of acidic extracellular environments of cancer cells. The results demonstrate diminishing green/red (550/630 nm) fluorescence intensity ratios for HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells in comparison to HEK-293 healthy cells suggesting a potential use of GO as a non-invasive optical sensor for cancer microenvironments.

A total of 19,785 newly diagnosed CC patients were registered during 2010–2016, among them only 16,946 (85.6%) with primary CC tumor. There was no difference in treatment modality between DM and non-DM patients. However intergroup assessment showed that type 2DM have significantly higher rate of mortality in both overall mortality (28.3%) and CC-specific (11.7%) as compared to Type 1DM (17.3%; 5.5%) and non DM patients (12.7%; 9.1%) (p < 0.001). Within group assessments showed that Type 2DM patients have better quality of life (mean 7.13 ± 3.67) (p < 0.001) and less distress levels (mean 2.41 ± 0.63) (p < 0.011) as compared to type1 DM (meant 10.54 ± 2.11; 3.19 ± 1.07). This study concluded that T2DM prognostic effect still remained after adjusting demographic and clinical parameters. Type 1 diabetes mellitus showed better OS and CSS then type2 DM. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Despite the widening range of high-throughput platforms and exponential growth of generated data volume, the validation of biomarkers discovered from large-scale data remains a challenging field. In order to tackle cancer heterogeneity and comply with the data dimensionality, a number of network and pathway approaches were invented but rarely systematically applied to this task. We propose a new method, called NEAmarker, for finding sensitive and robust biomarkers at the pathway level. scores from network enrichment analysis transform the original space of altered genes into a lower-dimensional space of pathways. These dimensions are then correlated with phenotype variables. The method was first tested using in vitro data from three anti-cancer drug screens and then on clinical data of The Cancer Genome Atlas. It proved superior to the single-gene and alternative enrichment analyses in terms of (1) universal applicability to different data types with a possibility of cross-platform integration, (2) consistency of the discovered correlates between independent drug screens, and (3) ability to explain differential survival of treated patients. Our new screen of anti-cancer compounds validated the performance of multivariate models of drug sensitivity. The previously proposed methods of enrichment analysis could achieve comparable levels of performance in certain tests. However, only our method could discover predictors of both in vitro response and patient survival given administration of the same drug. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

SPIONs entrapped in the core of the nanocomplex may act as a hyperthermia agent and generate localized heat upon excitation with an alternating magnetic field (AMF), thus enabling a thermo-chemotherapy strategy for cancer treatment. Accordingly, the cytotoxic effect and the mode of cell death triggered by the nanocomplex in combination with AMF were evaluated on two different cancer cell lines with various folate receptor (FR) expression levels, including KB nasopharyngeal cancer cells overexpressing FRs as the model and MCF-7 breast cancer cells with low level of FRs as the blank sample. The obtained results showed that KB cell death was greater than the cell death observed in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, a majority of cell death in both cell lines were related to apoptosis when the folate-modified nanocomplex was used instated of the non-folate-modified nanocomplex. Therefore, functionalizing the nanocomplex with folate modulated the response to thermo-chemotherapy by shifting the cell death pathways toward apoptosis." ;

We examined TILs grades of pretreatment cancer tissue specimens and residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab and determined the predictive utility of the TILs grade in pathological complete response (pCR) and the prognostic power of TILs in HER2-positive breast cancer. This cohort study included 128 HER2-positive breast cancer who received NAC with trastuzumab. TILs grading of the tumor stroma in pretreatment biopsy specimens and residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab was categorized as low, intermediate, and high based on the criteria of the International Working Group. In current study, the pCR rate was 64.8%, and the Relapse-free survival (RFS) was significantly worse in the non-pCR group than in the pCR group. The pCR rate correlated with the TILs grade in pretreatment tumors. In 45 non-pCR patients, TILs grade was higher in the residual tumors than in the pretreatment tumors. The RFS was significantly better in residual tumors with high TILs grade than those with low TILs grade (p = 0.033). In conclusion, assessment of the TILs grade in residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab might be necessary to determine patients with good prognosis among those who do not achieve pCR. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

However, their clinical importance in gallbladder cancer has rarely been explored. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of surgical intervention and the effectiveness of preoperative test on neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) for predicting the prognosis in gallbladder cancer patients. In this study, a total of 255 gallbladder cancer patients were retrospectively selected. For each patient, we recorded his/her treatment algorithm (with or without surgery) and their preoperative inflammatory biomarkers, as well as their detailed survival information for 5 years. A total of 216 patients received surgical intervention and the other 39 chose conservative treatment. The median survival time was 4.6 months for non-surgical group (P < 0.001), and 12.2 months for surgical intervention group. Among the surgical group, ROC analysis showed the AUC of NLR, PLR and MLR were 0.675 (95% CI: 0.600 to 0.751, P < 0.001), 0.599 (95% CI: 0.520 to 0.677, P = 0.017) and 0.607 (95% CI: 0.529 to 0.686, P = 0.009), respectively.

        fabio:abstract    "Most targeting strategies of anticancer drug delivery systems (DDSs) rely on the surface functionalization of nanocarriers with specific ligands, which trigger the internalization in cancer cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The endocytosis implies the entrapment of DDSs in acidic vesicles (endosomes and lysosomes) and their eventual ejection by exocytosis. This process, intrinsic to eukaryotic cells, is one of the main drawbacks of DDSs because it reduces the drug bioavailability in the intracellular environment. The escape of DDSs from the acidic vesicles is, therefore, crucial to enhance the therapeutic performance at low drug dose. To this end, we developed a multifunctionalized DDS that combines high specificity towards cancer cells with endosomal escape capabilities. Doxorubicin-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles were functionalized with polyethylenimine, a polymer commonly used to induce endosomal rupture, and hyaluronic acid, which binds to CD44 receptors, overexpressed in cancer cells. We show irrefutable proof that the developed DDS can escape the endosomal pathway upon polymeric functionalization. Interestingly, the combination of the two polymers resulted in higher endosomal escape efficiency than the polyethylenimine coating alone. Hyaluronic acid additionally provides the system with cancer targeting capability and enzymatically controlled drug release. Thanks to this multifunctionality, the engineered DDS had cytotoxicity comparable to the pure drug whilst displaying high specificity towards cancer cells. The polymeric engineering here developed enhances the performance of DDS at low drug dose, holding great potential for anticancer therapeutic applications. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Using multiple aggressive murine models of triple-negative breast cancer, we have recently demonstrated that the early administration of oncolytic Maraba virus (MRB) prior to surgical resection of the primary tumor is sufficient to minimize the metastatic burden, protect against tumor rechallenge, cure a fraction of the mice and sensitize refractory tumors to immune checkpoint blockade without the need for further treatment. Here, we apply our surgical model to other OVs: Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Adenovirus (Ad), Reovirus (Reo) and Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and show that all of the tested OVs could positively change the outcome of the treated animals. The growth of the primary and secondary tumors was differently affected by the various OVs and most of the viruses conferred survival benefits in this neoadjuvant setting despite the absence of direct treatment following rechallenge.

Recent data indicate that p130Cas association to ErbB2 protects ErbB2 from degradation, thus enhancing tumorigenesis. Therefore, inhibiting p130Cas/ErbB2 interaction might represent a new therapeutic strategy to target breast cancer. Here we demonstrate by performing Molecular Modeling, Molecular Dynamics, dot blot, ELISA and fluorescence quenching experiments, that p130Cas binds directly to ErbB2. Then, by structure-based virtual screening, we identified two potential inhibitors of p130Cas/ErbB2 interaction. Their experimental validation was performed in vitro and in ErbB2-positive breast cancer cellular models. The results highlight that both compounds interfere with p130Cas/ErbB2 binding and significantly affect cell proliferation and sensitivity to Trastuzumab. Overall, this study identifies p130Cas/ErbB2 complex as a potential breast cancer target revealing new therapeutic perspectives for protein-protein interaction (PPI). © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

A large number of clinical applications have revealed that Trametes robiniophila Μurr. (Huaier) exhibits an anti-tumour effect. However, loss of the bioactive components of Huaier during the extraction procedure with water is unavoidable, and the underlying mechanism of the anti-cancer effect of Huaier remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer effect of Huaier n-butanol extract, which contained 51.4% total flavonoids, on HGC27, MGC803, and AGS human GC cell lines in vitro. At a low concentration, Huaier n-butanol extract inhibited the growth of these GC cell types, induced cell cycle arrest and reduced cell metastasis. Moreover, Huaier n-butanol extract suppressed the c-Myc-Bmi1 signalling pathway, and overexpression of Bmi1 reversed the effects of Huaier n-butanol extract on GC cells. Thus, our findings indicate that Huaier n-butanol extract suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of GC cells via a c-Myc-Bmi1-mediated approach, providing a new perspective for our understanding of the anti-tumour effects of Huaier. These results suggest that Huaier n-butanol extract could be an attractive therapeutic adjuvant for the treatment of human GC. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

In the present study, we screened the anticancer potential of supernatant metabolites from eight native haloarchaeal strains obtained from a culture collection in Iran. Five human cancer cell lines including breast, lung, prostate and also human fibroblast cells as the normal control were used in the present study. Moreover, to evaluate the anti-tumor effect of the selected supernatant, inhibition of sphere formation and tumor development was assessed in-vitro and in-vivo, respectively. Among all strains, supernatant metabolites from Halobacterium salinarum IBRC M10715 had the most potent cytotoxic effect on prostate cancer cell lines (IC50 = 0.5 mg/mL) without any effects on normal cells. It significantly increased both early and late apoptosis (about 11% and 9%, respectively) in the androgen-dependent PC3 cell line, reduced sphere formation ability of DU145 and PC3 cells with down-regulation of SOX2 gene expression. Furthermore, our results revealed that tumors developed in nude mice significantly shrank post intratumor injection of metabolites of the haloarchaeal strain. In conclusion, we suggested here for the first time that supernatant metabolites from Halobacterium salinarum IBRC M10715 could be a novel component against prostate cancer in-vitro and in-vivo with remarkable reduction in stem-like properties of tumor. © 2018, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

The main HNSCC risk factors are tobacco, excessive alcohol use, and the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV positive (+) cancers are etiologically different from other HNSCC and often show better prognosis. The current knowledge regarding HNSCC miRNA profiles is still incomplete especially in the context of HPV+ cancer. Thus, we analyzed 61 freshly collected primary oral (OSCC) and oropharyngeal (OPSCC) SCC samples. HPV DNA and RNA was found in 21% cases. The Illumina whole-genome small-RNA profiling by next-generation sequencing was done on 22 samples and revealed 7 specific miRNAs to HPV+ OSCC, 77 to HPV+ OPSCC, and additional 3 shared with both; 51 miRNAs were specific to HPV− OPSCC, 62 to HPV− OSCC, and 31 shared with both. The results for 9 miRNAs (miR-9, -21, -29a, -100, -106b, -143 and -145) were assessed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction on the whole study population. The data was additionally confirmed by reanalyzing publicly available miRNA sequencing Cancer Genome Atlas consortium (TCGA) HNSCC data. Cell signaling pathway analysis revealed differences between HPV+ and HPV− HNSCC. Our findings compared with literature data revealed extensive heterogeneity of miRNA deregulation with only several miRNAs consistently affected, and miR-9 being the most likely HPV related miRNA. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Resistance to 5-Fluorouracil chemotherapy is a major cause of therapeutic failure in colon cancer cure. Development of combined therapies constitutes an effective strategy to inhibit cancer cells and prevent the emergence of drug resistance. For this purpose, we investigated the anti-tumoral effect of thirteen phenolic compounds, from the Tunisian quince Cydonia oblonga Miller, alone or combined to 5-FU, on the human 5-FU-resistant LS174-R colon cancer cells in comparison to parental cells. Our results showed that only Kaempferol was able to chemo-sensitize 5-FU-resistant LS174-R cells. This phenolic compound combined with 5-FU exerted synergistic inhibitory effect on cell viability. This combination enhanced the apoptosis and induced cell cycle arrest of both chemo-resistant and sensitive cells through impacting the expression levels of different cellular effectors. Kaempferol also blocked the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and modulated the expression of JAK/STAT3, MAPK, PI3K/AKT and NF-κB. In silico docking analysis suggested that the potent anti-tumoral effect of Kaempferol, compared to its two analogs (Kaempferol 3-O-glucoside and Kampferol 3-O-rutinoside), can be explained by the absence of glucosyl groups. Overall, our data propose Kaempferol as a potential chemotherapeutic agent to be used alone or in combination with 5-FU to overcome colon cancer drug resistance. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Considering the high prevalence and mortality rate of colorectal cancer, in this study we tried to design and validate a standard printed form and evaluate oncologists’ and nurses’ adherence to this form. This cross-sectional study was performed in Omid hospital, Mashhad, Iran from January 2015 to October 2015. A Chemotherapy form including various demographic and clinical parameters and approved chemotherapy regimens for colorectal cancer was designed by the clinical pharmacist and validated by clinical oncologists working in this center. All eligible patients admitted in this center during this period of time were included in the study. Adherence of the oncologists and nurses to this form and probable medication errors were identified by the pharmacy student. Sixty-seven patients with colorectal cancer and a total of 251 chemotherapy courses were evaluated. All patients received regimens compatible with developed form but in 206 courses (98.56%) of chemotherapy dosing error happened and in most of cases patients received lower than calculated dose (37.8%). Three errors occurred in administration step by nurses which they infused the medication in shorter than recommended duration. In general, oncologists’ adherence with developed form for chemotherapy of colorectal cancer was relatively high, except in dose calculation. Avoiding from rounding the calculated medications’ doses and precise calculation of patients’ body surface area can prevent most of medication errors and reduce risk of adverse drug reaction occurrence. © 2018, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

Nevertheless, the importance of transfusion timing is still unclear. The primary purpose of this study is to appraise whether the receipt of intraoperative blood transfusion (BT) differ from postoperative BT in regards to cancer outcomes in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients treated with nephrectomy. Data on 1168 patients with RCC, who underwent radical or partial nephrectomy as primary therapy between 1988–2013 were analyzed. PBT was defined as transfusion of allogeneic red blood cells (RBC) during surgery or the postsurgical period. Survival was analyzed and compared using the Kaplan–Meier method with the log-rank test. Of 1168 patients, 198 patients (16.9%) received a PBT. Including 117 intraoperative BT and 81 postoperative BT. Only 21 (10.6%) patients required both intraoperative and postoperative BT. On multivariate analyses, receipt of PBT was associated with significantly worse local disease recurrence (HR: 2.4; P = 0.017), metastatic progression (HR: 2.7; P = 0.005), cancer-specific mortality (HR: 3.5; P = 0.002) and all-cause mortality (HR: 2.1; P = 0.005). Nevertheless, postoperative BT was not independently associated with increased risk of local recurrence (p = 0.1), metastatic progression (P = 0.16) or kidney cancer death (P = 0.63), yet did significantly increase the risk of overall mortality (HR: 2.6; P = 0.004). In the current study, intraoperative transfusion of allogeneic RBC is associated with increased risks of cancer recurrence and mortality following nephrectomy. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

For this reason novel therapies accounting for PDAC peculiarities, such as the relevant stromal reaction, are urgently needed. Here adipose mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (AD-MSC) have been armed to constantly release a soluble trimeric and multimeric variant of the known anti-cancer TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (sTRAIL). This cancer gene therapy strategy was in vitro challenged demonstrating that sTRAIL was thermally stable and able to induce apoptosis in the PDAC lines BxPC-3, MIA PaCa-2 and against primary PDAC cells. sTRAIL released by AD-MSC relocated into the tumor stroma was able to significantly counteract tumor growth in vivo with a significant reduction in tumor size, in cytokeratin-7+ cells and by an anti-angiogenic effect. In parallel, histology on PDAC specimens form patients (n = 19) was performed to investigate the levels of TRAIL DR4, DR5 and OPG receptors generating promising insights on the possible clinical translation of our approach. These results indicate that adipose MSC can very efficiently vehicle a novel TRAIL variant opening unexplored opportunities for PDAC treatment. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Therefore, identification of novel therapeutic targets involved in melanoma progression is urgently needed for developing effective therapeutic methods. Overexpression of interleukin-13 receptor α2 (IL13Rα2) is observed in several cancer types including glioma and pancreatic cancer. Although IL13Rα2 is implicated in the progression of various types of cancer, its expression and roles in the malignant melanoma have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we showed that IL13Rα2 was expressed in approximately 7.5% melanoma patients. While IL13Rα2 expression in human melanoma cells decreased their proliferation in vitro, it promoted in vivo tumour growth and angiogenesis in melanoma xenograft mouse model. We also found that the expression of amphiregulin, a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, was correlated with IL13Rα2 expression in cultured melanoma cells, xenograft tumour tissues and melanoma clinical samples. Furthermore, expression of amphiregulin promoted tumour growth, implicating causal relationship between the expression of IL13Rα2 and amphiregulin. These results suggest that IL13Rα2 enhances tumorigenicity by inducing angiogenesis in malignant melanoma, and serves as a potential therapeutic target of malignant melanoma. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Experiment in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines demonstrated up-regulation of PKD2 led to high expression of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vim, mmp9 et al.) and EMT transcription factors(zeb1, twist, snail), and the results were reversed when PKD2 was knocked down. Further investigation showed that abrogation of PKD2 inhibited A549 cell migration, invasion, proliferation and induced cell arrest in G2/M phase.

We showed for the first time that Raman imaging can be used to distinguish successfully between glycosylated and nonglycosylated proteins in normal and cancer tissue. Thousands of protein, lipid and glycan species exist in cells and tissues and their metabolism is monitored via numerous pathways, networks and methods. The metabolism can change in response to cellular environment alterations, such as development of a disease. Measuring such alterations and understanding the pathways involved are crucial to fully understand cellular metabolism in cancer development. In this paper Raman markers of glycogen, glycosaminoglycan, chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate proteoglycan were identified based on their vibrational signatures. High spatial resolution of Raman imaging combined with chemometrics allows separation of individual species from many chemical components present in each cell. We have found that metabolism of proteins, lipids and glycans is markedly deregulated in breast (adenocarcinoma) and brain (medulloblastoma) tumors. We have identified two glycoforms in the normal breast tissue and the malignant brain tissue in contrast to the breast cancer tissue where only one glycoform has been identified. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate anti-cancer effects of NLC-Citral in MDA MB-231 cells in vitro through the Annexin V, cell cycle, JC-1 and fluorometric assays. Additionally, this study is aimed to effects of NLC-Citral in reducing the tumor weight and size in 4T1 induced murine breast cancer model. Results showed that NLC-Citral induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest in MDA MB-231 cells. Furthermore, a prominent anti-metastatic ability of NLC-Citral was demonstrated in vitro using scratch, migration and invasion assays. A significant reduction of migrated and invaded cells was observed in the NLC-Citral treated MDA MB-231 cells. To further evaluate the apoptotic and anti-metastatic mechanism of NLC-Citral at the molecular level, microarray-based gene expression and proteomic profiling were conducted. Based on the result obtained, NLC-Citral was found to regulate several important signaling pathways related to cancer development such as apoptosis, cell cycle, and metastasis signaling pathways. Additionally, gene expression analysis was validated through the targeted RNA sequencing and real-time polymerase chain reaction. In conclusion, the NLC-Citral inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells in vitro, majorly through the induction of apoptosis, anti-metastasis, anti-angiogenesis potentials, and reducing the tumor weight and size without altering the therapeutic effects of citral. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The incidence of developing cancer should increase with the body mass, yet is not the case, a conundrum referred to as Peto’s paradox. Elephants have a lower incidence of cancer suggesting that these animals have probably evolved different ways to protect themselves against the disease. The paradox is worth revisiting with the realization that most mammals encode an endogenous APOBEC3 cytidine deaminase capable of mutating single stranded DNA. Indeed, the mutagenic activity of some APOBEC3 enzymes has been shown to introduce somatic mutations into genomic DNA. These enzymes are now recognized as causal agent responsible for the accumulation of CG- > TA transitions and DNA breaks leading to chromosomal rearrangements in human cancer genomes. Here, we identified an elephant A3Z1 gene, related to human APOBEC3A and showed that it could efficiently deaminate cytidine, 5-methylcytidine and produce DNA breaks leading to massive apoptosis, similar to other mammalian APOBEC3A enzymes where body mass varies by up to four orders of magnitude. Consequently, it could be considered that eAZ1 might contribute to cancer in elephants in a manner similar to their proposed role in humans. If so, eAZ1 might be particularly well regulated to counter Peto’s paradox. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Despite recent improvements in treatment, ovarian cancer is still the leading cause of death from gynaecological malignancies. Today, marine mollusks are considered as natural source of new biologically and pharmacologically active compounds by scientists and the pharmaceutical industries. The aim of this study is to investigate the selective apoptotic effects of Turbo coronatus crude extract fractions on human epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells and mitochondria. The cells and mitochondria were isolated from cancerous and non-cancerous ovarian tissues and exposed to IC 50 concentration of F1 fraction for evaluation of mitochondrial and cellular parameters. Our results showed that F1 fraction of T. coronatus crude extract significantly induced toxic effects only in the cancerous ovarian mitochondria, including increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, mitochondrial swelling, and cytochrome c release.Flow-cytometry analysis demonstrated that F1 fraction of T. coronatus progressively induced apoptosis and necrosis only on EOC but not non-cancerous cells. We eventuallyconcluded that F1 fraction of T. coronatus crude extract selectively induces apoptosis in EOC through a ROS-mediated pathway. © 2018, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

        fabio:abstract     "Artemisinin is used as an antimalarial and anticancer agent with minimal toxic effects on the host body. Biotin-PEG-PCL polymers have been used for targeted drug delivery to cancer, as well as to improve the pharmacokinetics of the drug and reduce its effects. In this study, biotin-conjugated copolymers were fabricated with polymerization of the ring opening method and the properties of copolymer and nanoparticles were investigated using various techniques. The toxicity of artemisinin and its nanoparticles have been investigated on MCF-7 and normal HFF2 cells. The results showed that the encapsulation efficacy of artemisinin in nanoparticles was 45.5 ± 0.41%. The release profile of the drug indicates that the release is slow and controlled and is approximately pH dependent. The results of artemisinin cell culture on human breast cancer cells showed that biotin-PEG-PCL nanoparticles had an inhibitory effect on MCF-7 cells and had no toxic effects on HFF2 cells. Anticancer activity in vivo in the 4T1 breast cancer model showed that tumour volumes were decreased up 40 mm3 by ART-loaded micelles and 76 mm3 by free ART, compared to the control group (2150 mm). In vivo results showed that this formulation significantly increases the accumulation of substances in the tumours. Therefore, the molecular formulation of ART-based copolymers can be a desirable process for cancer treatment purposes. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group." ;

It has been estimated that there are about 2 billion people with a serological profile of HBV infection, and 360 million patients worldwide living with chronic HBV-associated liver disease, hence the need to find an efficient and precise diagnosis technique to drive a robust treatment for Hepatitis B virus cannot be over emphasized. The emergence of analytical device like biosensor which combines biological and physicochemical element to detect HBV in screened samples has been very helpful in providing a timely intervention to tame this virus.

        fabio:abstract    "n-Butylidenephthalide (BP) is a potential anti-cancer drug, which can be extracted from Angelica sinensis (Danggui). Previous reports have shown the effectiveness of BP in treating cancer diseases. However, BP has no targeting capacity towards specific cancer cells. To improve treatment efficiency and reduce the dose of BP used in cancer treatment, targeting-based approaches should be developed. In the present study, we used riboflavin-5′-phosphate (RFMP) immobilized iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4 MNPs) as carriers for BP to treat cancer cell lines derived from liver, prostate and breast. These model cancer cells overexpress riboflavin receptors on their cell membrane and are also sensitive to BP treatment. Thus, BP-binding free RFMP on MNPs can be used as probes to target these model cells, whereas BP can be readily released on target cancer cells. Cell viability was twofold lower by using Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs immobilized with BP than that achieved by using free-form BP at a similar amount. Moreover, BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs have no apparent harmful effects on non-target cells. In addition, we evaluated the level of cysteine-aspartic acid protease 3 (caspase 3) in the resultant cell lysate obtained after treatment by BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs to demonstrate that apoptosis is mainly involved in the growth inhibition of target cells. © 2017, © 2017 The Author(s).

The aim of this national population-based retrospective study was to analyze the relationship between MetS and the incidence of laryngeal cancer. Patients with laryngeal cancer (ICD-10: C32) between 2009 and 2010 were retrospectively identified and tracked until 2015 using the Korean Health Insurance claims database. During the seven-year follow-up period, 5,322 subjects were newly diagnosed with larynx cancer. The mean age of people with laryngeal cancer was much higher than those without (63.29 vs. 47.7 years, p < 0.0001), and the incidence of larynx cancer in men was much higher than that in women (93.16% vs. 6.84%, p < 0.0001). Age, gender, smoking status, alcohol intake, and exercise-adjusted hazard ratios indicated that participants with MetS had a 1.13-fold higher hazard of having larynx cancer than those without MetS. The number of MetS components was a strong risk factor for laryngeal cancer with a higher risk estimate of this cancer in both ex- and current smokers as well as people who have never smoked. MetS was found to be an independent risk factor for the incidence of laryngeal cancer. In Korea, MetS and its components are significantly associated with the development of laryngeal cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

In this study, we demonstrated that FLOT2 expression levels were greatly upregulated in glioma tissues and cell lines, and the FLOT2 expression in glioma tissue was markedly associated with tumour stage and size. Overexpression of FLOT2 was correlated with poor prognosis of glioma patients. The functional assay revealed that silenced FLOT2 repressed the viability, migration, and invasion of glioma cells. And then, we detected the relationship between miR-449 and FLOT2. Luciferase reporter assay and Western blot results showed that miR-449 directly binding the 3′UTR sequence of FLOT2 and regulated FLOT2 expression in glioma cells. Finally, we detected the expression levels of miR-449 in glioma tissue and cell lines and found that miR-449 was significantly downregulated in glioma tissues and cell lines. In conclusion, we demonstrated that overexpression FLOT2 was associated with poor prognosis of glioma patients and involved in the progression of glioma, identifying a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for glioma progression. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group." ;

One of the consequences of chromosomal rearrangement is gene fusions in the cancer genome. We have previously identified a panel of fusion genes in aggressive prostate cancers. In this study, we showed that 6 of these fusion genes are present in 7 different types of human malignancies with variable frequencies. Among them, the CCNH-C5orf30 and TRMT11-GRIK2 gene fusions were found in breast cancer, colon cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, ovarian cancer and liver cancer, with frequencies ranging from 12.9% to 85%. In contrast, four other gene fusions (mTOR-TP53BP1, TMEM135-CCDC67, KDM4-AC011523.2 and LRRC59-FLJ60017) are less frequent. Both TRMT11-GRIK2 and CCNH-C5orf30 are also frequently present in lymph node metastatic cancer samples from the breast, colon and ovary. Thus, detecting these fusion transcripts may have significant biological and clinical implications in cancer patient management. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Quantifying the genetic correlation between cancers can provide important insights into the mechanisms driving cancer etiology. Using genome-wide association study summary statistics across six cancer types based on a total of 296,215 cases and 301,319 controls of European ancestry, here we estimate the pair-wise genetic correlations between breast, colorectal, head/neck, lung, ovary and prostate cancer, and between cancers and 38 other diseases. We observed statistically significant genetic correlations between lung and head/neck cancer (r g = 0.57, p = 4.6 × 10 −8 ), breast and ovarian cancer (r g = 0.24, p = 7 × 10 −5 ), breast and lung cancer (r g = 0.18, p =1.5 × 10 −6 ) and breast and colorectal cancer (r g = 0.15, p = 1.1 × 10 −4 ). We also found that multiple cancers are genetically correlated with non-cancer traits including smoking, psychiatric diseases and metabolic characteristics. Functional enrichment analysis revealed a significant excess contribution of conserved and regulatory regions to cancer heritability. Our comprehensive analysis of cross-cancer heritability suggests that solid tumors arising across tissues share in part a common germline genetic basis. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Purpose: Several previous studies have shown that oral bisphosphonates (BPs) are associated with the incidence of 13 specific cancers, including lung cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the findings are heterogeneous. Methods and results: Relevant studies published in databases such as PubMed, Embase database, and Cochrane library were systematically retrieved from inception to August 25th, 2017, regardless of language, by two investigators independently. Afterwards, the maximum adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted from the retrieved studies. Finally, 13 cohort studies involving 1,510,763 participants were enrolled into this meta-analysis. No significant relationship was found between oral BPs and the risk of all-cause cancer in osteoporosis (OP) patients among the entire population (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80–1.18; I 2 92.5%). Besides, oral BPs could remarkably reduce the incidence of breast cancer (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68–0.92; I 2 54%) and endometrial cancer (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64–0.96; I 2 0%) in postmenopausal OP females. In addition, oral BPs were also found to evidently reduce the incidence of upper gastrointestinal cancer in OP patients among the entire population (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54–0.98; I 2 36.1%). However, oral BPs may lead to increased risk of liver cancer in mixed genders (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.03–2.77; I 2 30.7%). Conclusions: Taken together, oral BPs do not increase the risk of incidence of all-cause cancer; instead, they can reduce the incidence of breast, endometrial, and upper gastrointestinal cancers among the postmenopausal OP females. Our analysis stratified by gender suggests that oral BPs may increase the incidence of liver cancer in mixed genders, while no significant association was observed in females. Careful analysis of post-marketing data should be conducted to address the clinical relevance of our results on the putative association of oral BP use and liver cancer suggested by our meta-analysis. © 2017, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play critical roles in the tumor progression. However, it remains unclear how cancer cells migrate in the three-dimensional (3D) matrix of cancer tissues and how CAFs support the cancer invasion. Here we propose a novel mechanism of fibroblast-dependent cancer cell invasion in the 3D collagen matrix. Human cancer cell lines from the pancreas (Panc-1), lung (A549) and some other organs actively adhered to normal fibroblasts and primary lung CAFs in cultures. To show its significance in tumor invasion, we designed a new invasion assay in which homogeneous microspheroids consisting of cancer cells and fibroblasts were embedded into collagen gel. Time-lapse experiments showed that cancer cells adhered to and quickly migrated on the long protrusions of fibroblasts in the 3D collagen matrix. Fibroblast-free cancer cells poorly invaded the matrix. Experiments with function-blocking antibodies, siRNAs, and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that cancer cells adhered to fibroblasts through integrin α5β1-mediated binding to fibronectin on the surface of fibroblasts. Immunochemical analyses of the co-cultures and lung cancers suggested that cancer cells could acquire the migratory force by the fibronectin/integrin signaling. Our results also revealed that the fibroblast-bound fibronectin was a preferential substrate for cancer cells to migrate in the collagen matrix. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The prognosis of pancreatic cancer remains dismal despite continuous and considerable efforts. Integrins (ITGs) are highly expressed in various malignant cancers. However, very few studies investigated the role of integrin α3 (ITGα3) in malignant cancers. Here, we determined the functional role of ITGα3 in pancreatic cancer. Analysis of public microarray databases and Western blot analysis indicated a unique expression of ITGα3 in human pancreatic cancer. Silencing ITGα3 expression significantly inhibited the viability and migration of human pancreatic cancer cells. Notably, ablation of ITGα3 expression resulted in a significant decrease of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression compared with transfection of control-siRNA through an increased number of leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domain protein 1 (LRIG1) expression. In addition, ablating ITGα3 inhibited tumour growth via blockade of EGFR signalling in vivo. Furthermore, the highly expressed ITGα3 led to a poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. Our results provide novel insights into ITGα3-induced aggressive pancreatic cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Breast cancer metastasis accounts for most of the deaths from breast cancer. Since epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in promoting metastasis of cancer, many mechanisms regarding EMT have been studied. We previously showed that Ribonucleic acid export 1 (RAE1) is dysregulated in breast cancer and its overexpression leads to aggressive breast cancer phenotypes by inducing EMT. Here, we evaluated the functional capacity of RAE1 in breast cancer metastasis by using a three-dimensional (3D) culture system and xenograft models. Furthermore, to investigate the mechanisms of RAE1-driven EMT, in vitro studies were carried out. The induction of EMT with RAE1-overexpression was confirmed under the 3D culture system and in vivo system. Importantly, RAE1 mediates upregulation of an EMT marker ZEB1, by binding to the promoter region of ZEB1. Knockdown of ZEB1 in RAE1-overexpressing cells suppressed invasive and migratory behaviors, accompanied by an increase in epithelial and a decrease in mesenchymal markers. Taken together, these data demonstrate that RAE1 contributes to breast cancer metastasis by regulating a key EMT-inducing factor ZEB1 expression, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Obesity is a risk factor for many cancers including breast, esophageal, colon, and thyroid cancer. We aimed to evaluate the association of thyroid cancer with body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and weight change. This nationwide population-based cohort study included 11,323,006 adults who joined the national health screening program. Weight change was defined as the difference between the weight of the subjects measured during the study period and the weight at the time of four years ago. For evaluating the association between the weight change and the risk of thyroid cancer, subjects without weight change for four years were defined as the reference group. Mean age was 50.1 ± 13.7 years and 44% were female. In total, 50,464 subjects (0.4%) had newly-diagnosed thyroid cancer. After multivariable analyses, the incidence of thyroid cancer increased significantly in subjects with larger WC as well as higher BMI (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). In subjects who were lean and became obese, the incidence of thyroid cancers increased significantly (hazard ratio [HR] 1.15 [1.11–1.19]). In subjects who were obese and became lean, the incidence of thyroid cancers decreased significantly (HR 0.89 [0.86–0.93]). These results demonstrated that higher BMI and larger WC were significantly associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer. Weight gain in lean subjects was associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer, and weight reduction in subjects with obesity was associated with a decreased risk of thyroid cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) has increased among Norwegian women, and is among the highest in the world. In order to understand this increase, country specific dietary exposures have been investigated. The aim of this study was to quantify the association between consumption of brown cheese, a common bread topping in Norway, and colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer in the prospective Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) Study. Data on brown cheese consumption and adjustment factors was available for 82 527 women. During a mean of 14.6 years of follow-up (1.2 million person-years), there were 1360 cases of colorectal cancer (907 colon; 453 rectal). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer sites. We modelled restricted cubic splines with 4 knots, to assess a possible non-linear relationship between brown cheese intake and the investigated cancer sites. In the age-adjusted model, consumption of more than 2 slices (>16 grams) of brown cheese per day was associated with 13% reduced risk of colon cancer (95% CI 4%-21%) compared to women who did not consume brown cheese. The multivariable-adjusted model, however, showed no association between brown cheese consumption and the risk of colorectal, colon, or rectal cancer (colorectal: HR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.76–1.13, p-trend 0.37; colon: HR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.65–1.06; p-trend = 0.10; rectal: HR = 1.16, 95% CI 0.84–1.1.61, p-trend = 0.41). In this large, prospective cohort study of women, consumption of brown cheese was suggestively protective against colon cancer. However, adjustment attenuated the inverse risk association. Brown cheese consumption was not associated with rectal cancer, or colorectal cancer overall. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Current cancer diagnosis utilizes histopathology, which requires tissue acquisition, extensive processing and, in most cases, relies on the qualitative morphological analysis of tissues and cells. Molecular biomarkers are only available for a few specific tumor subtypes. We discovered that the fluorescence polarization (Fpol) of Methylene Blue (MB) is significantly higher in cancer than in normal human breast tissues and cells. We confirmed that fluorescence polarization imaging did not affect the viability of the cells and yielded highly significant differences between cancer and normal cells using MB concentrations as low as 0.05 and 0.01 mg/ml. To explain this phenomenon we examined intracellular localization of MB and its fluorescence lifetime. We determined that higher fluorescence polarization of MB occurs due to its increased accumulation in mitochondria of cancer cells, as well as shorter fluorescence lifetime in cancer relative to normal cells. As quantitative MB Fpol imaging can be performed in vivo and in real time, it holds the potential to provide an accurate quantitative marker of cancer at the cellular level. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

However, the specific combinations of mutations responsible for the vast majority of cancers have not been identified. Current computational approaches focus on identifying driver genes and mutations. Although individually these mutations can increase the risk of cancer they do not result in cancer without additional mutations. We present a fundamentally different approach for identifying the cause of individual instances of cancer: we search for combinations of genes with carcinogenic mutations (multi-hit combinations) instead of individual driver genes or mutations. We developed an algorithm that identified a set of multi-hit combinations that differentiate between tumor and normal tissue samples with 91% sensitivity (95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 89–92%) and 93% specificity (95% CI = 91–94%) on average for seventeen cancer types. We then present an approach based on mutational profile that can be used to distinguish between driver and passenger mutations within these genes. These combinations, with experimental validation, can aid in better diagnosis, provide insights into the etiology of cancer, and provide a rational basis for designing targeted combination therapies. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

We developed a novel computational platform applying a multi-modal approach to filter out passengers and more robustly identify putative driver genes. The primary filter identifies enrichment of cancer mutations in CATH functional families (CATH-FunFams) – structurally and functionally coherent sets of evolutionary related domains. Using structural representatives from CATH-FunFams, we subsequently seek enrichment of mutations in 3D and show that these mutation clusters have a very significant tendency to lie close to known functional sites or conserved sites predicted using CATH-FunFams. Our third filter identifies enrichment of putative driver genes in functionally coherent protein network modules confirmed by literature analysis to be cancer associated. Our approach is complementary to other domain enrichment approaches exploiting Pfam families, but benefits from more functionally coherent groupings of domains. Using a set of mutations from 22 cancers we detect 151 putative cancer drivers, of which 79 are not listed in cancer resources and include recently validated cancer associated genes EPHA7, DCC netrin-1 receptor and zinc-finger protein ZNF479. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Collectively, 86.3% (63/73) of HAMPs have recurrent alterations in at least 1 cancer type and 16 HAMPs, including 9 understudied HAMPs, are identified as putative therapeutic targets across multiple cancer types. For example, the recurrent focal amplification of BRD9 is observed in 9 cancer types and genetic depletion of BRD9 inhibits tumor growth.

        fabio:abstract    "The current system for evaluating prostate cancer architecture is the Gleason grading system which divides the morphology of cancer into five distinct architectural patterns, labeled 1 to 5 in increasing levels of cancer aggressiveness, and generates a score by summing the labels of the two most dominant patterns. The Gleason score is currently the most powerful prognostic predictor of patient outcomes; however, it suffers from problems in reproducibility and consistency due to the high intra-observer and inter-observer variability amongst pathologists. In addition, the Gleason system lacks the granularity to address potentially prognostic architectural features beyond Gleason patterns. We evaluate prostate cancer for architectural subtypes using techniques from topological data analysis applied to prostate cancer glandular architecture. In this work we demonstrate the use of persistent homology to capture architectural features independently of Gleason patterns. Specifically, using persistent homology, we compute topological representations of purely graded prostate cancer histopathology images of Gleason patterns 3,4 and 5, and show that persistent homology is capable of clustering prostate cancer histology into architectural groups through a ranked persistence vector. Our results indicate the ability of persistent homology to cluster prostate cancer histopathology images into unique groups with dominant architectural patterns consistent with the continuum of Gleason patterns. In addition, of particular interest, is the sensitivity of persistent homology to identify specific sub-architectural groups within single Gleason patterns, suggesting that persistent homology could represent a robust quantification method for prostate cancer architecture with higher granularity than the existing semi-quantitative measures. The capability of these topological representations to segregate prostate cancer by architecture makes them an ideal candidate for use as inputs to future machine learning approaches with the intent of augmenting traditional approaches with topological features for improved diagnosis and prognosis. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Among 8,651,569 cancer patients, 13,311 committed suicide; the rate of suicide was 28.58/ 100,000-person years, and the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of suicide was 4.44 (95% CI, 4.33, 4.55). The predominant patients who committed suicide were male (83%) and white (92%). Cancers of the lung, head and neck, testes, bladder, and Hodgkin lymphoma had the highest SMRs (> 5-10) through the follow up period. Elderly, white, unmarried males with localized disease are at highest risk vs other cancer patients. Among those diagnosed at < 50 years of age, the plurality of suicides is from hematologic and testicular tumors; if > 50, from prostate, lung, and colorectal cancer patients. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

However, the specific combinations of mutations responsible for the vast majority of cancers have not been identified. Current computational approaches focus on identifying driver genes and mutations. Although individually these mutations can increase the risk of cancer they do not result in cancer without additional mutations. We present a fundamentally different approach for identifying the cause of individual instances of cancer: we search for combinations of genes with carcinogenic mutations (multi-hit combinations) instead of individual driver genes or mutations. We developed an algorithm that identified a set of multi-hit combinations that differentiate between tumor and normal tissue samples with 91% sensitivity (95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 89–92%) and 93% specificity (95% CI = 91–94%) on average for seventeen cancer types. We then present an approach based on mutational profile that can be used to distinguish between driver and passenger mutations within these genes. These combinations, with experimental validation, can aid in better diagnosis, provide insights into the etiology of cancer, and provide a rational basis for designing targeted combination therapies. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The UHRF1-DNMT1 axis plays a key role in DNA maintenance methylation in mammals. Accumulative studies demonstrate that UHRF1 is broadly overexpressed in cancers, which contributes to cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Interestingly, a proteasome-dependent downregulation of UHRF1 has been observed in pluripotent ground state mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) cultured in the presence of two kinase (MEK1/MEK2 and GSK3β) inhibitors (termed 2i), raising the question whether UHRF1 is similarly regulated in cancer cells. Here we present evidence that while addition of 2i broadly downregulates UHRF1 and DNMT1 in various cancer cells, distinct underlying mechanisms are involved. In contrast to mESCs, 2i-induced downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in cancer cells cannot be rescued by proteasome inhibitor and occurs primarily at the level of transcription. Furthermore, downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 by 2i is due to inhibition of MEK1/MEK2, but not GSK3β activity. Data mining reveals a marked co-expression of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in normal tissues as well as cancers. We provide evidence that multiple transcription factors including E2F1 and SP1 mediate the transcriptional activation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 by the activated MEK/ERK pathway. Together our study reveals distinct regulation of UHRF1/DNMT1 in mESCs and cancer cells and identifies activated MEK/ERK pathway as a driving force for coordinated and aberrant over-expression of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in cancers. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

When it is applied to cancer cells, solid stress hinders their proliferation rate and promotes cancer cell invasion and metastatic potential. However, the underlying mechanisms of how it is implicated in cancer metastasis is not yet fully understood. Here, we used two pancreatic cancer cell lines and an established in vitro system to study the effect of solid stress-induced signal transduction on pancreatic cancer cell migration as well as the mechanism involved. Our results show that the migratory ability of cells increases as a direct response to solid stress. We also found that Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) expression and secretion is strongly upregulated in pancreatic cancer cells in response to mechanical compression. Performing a phosphoprotein screening, we identified that solid stress activates the Akt/CREB1 pathway to transcriptionally regulate GDF15 expression, which eventually promotes pancreatic cancer cell migration. Our results suggest a novel solid stress signal transduction mechanism bringing GDF15 to the centre of pancreatic tumor biology and rendering it a potential target for future anti-metastatic therapeutic innovations. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a cancer treatment that make use of the cancer-specific accumulation of porphyrins. We have reported that mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mitROS) upregulate uptake transporter of porphyrins, heme carrier protein-1 (HCP-1). The accumulation of cancer-specific porphyrins was increased by mitROS production, thereby the cancer-specific PDT cytotoxicity was enhanced. Thus we investigated whether mitROS production by hyperthermia can enhanced the cytotoxicity of PDT or not. In this study, 1 h of hyperthermia at 42 °C increased the mitROS production, and both the accumulation of cancer-specific porphyrins and the PDT cytotoxicity increased. Moreover, the authors treated cells with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) to examine the effect of mitROS. NAC inhibited the increasing ROS production after hyperthermia to restrain the post-treatment increase of cancer-specific porphyrins accumulation. Moreover, the increase of ROS production in cancer cells after hyperthermia upregulated HCP-1 expression and downregulated ABCG2 expression. These regulation were inhibited by NAC. These results suggest that hyperthermia treatment increased mitROS production, which involved HpD accumulation and enhanced PDT effects in cancer cells. The mechanism of this phenomenon was most likely to be due to both the upregulation of HCP-1 and the downregulation of ABCG2 by mitROS. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

In this study, we assessed the relationship between breast cancer and cadaverine biosynthesis. Cadaverine treatment of Balb/c female mice (500 nmol/kg p.o. q.d.) grafted with 4T1 breast cancer cells ameliorated the disease (lower mass and infiltration of the primary tumor, fewer metastases, and lower grade tumors). Cadaverine treatment of breast cancer cell lines corresponding to its serum reference range (100–800 nM) reverted endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, inhibited cellular movement and invasion, moreover, rendered cells less stem cell-like through reducing mitochondrial oxidation. Trace amino acid receptors (TAARs), namely, TAAR1, TAAR8 and TAAR9 were instrumental in provoking the cadaverine-evoked effects. Early stage breast cancer patients, versus control women, had reduced abundance of the CadA and LdcC genes in fecal DNA, both responsible for bacterial cadaverine production. Moreover, we found low protein expression of E. coli LdcC in the feces of stage 1 breast cancer patients. In addition, higher expression of lysine decarboxylase resulted in a prolonged survival among early-stage breast cancer patients. Taken together, cadaverine production seems to be a regulator of early breast cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Exogenous overexpression of CBX6 inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation, and induced cell cycle arrest along with suppression of migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro. Microarray analyses revealed that CBX6 governs a complex gene expression program. Moreover, CBX6 induced significant downregulation of bone marrow stromal cell antigen-2 (BST2), a potential therapeutic target, via interactions with its promoter region.

        fabio:abstract    "MRI plays important roles in endometrial and cervical cancer assessment, from detection to recurrent disease evaluation. Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common malignant tumor of the female genital tract in Western countries. EC patients are divided into risk categories based on histopathological tumor type, grade, and myometrial invasion depth. EC is surgically staged using the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) system. Since FIGO (2009) stage correlates with prognosis, preoperative staging is essential for tailored treatment. MRI reveals myometrial invasion depth, which correlates with tumor grade and lymph node metastases, and thus correlates with prognosis. Cervical cancer (CC) is the second most common cancer, and the third leading cause of cancer-related death among females in developing countries. The FIGO Gynecologic Oncology Committee recently revised its CC staging guidelines, allowing staging based on imaging and pathological findings when available. The revised FIGO (2017) staging includes node involvement and thus enables both therapy selection and evaluation, prognosis estimation, and calculation of end results. MRI can accurately assess prognostic indicators, e.g., tumor size, parametrial invasion, pelvic sidewall, and lymph node invasion. Despite these important roles of MRI, radiologists still face challenges due to the technical and interpretation pitfalls of MRI during all phases of endometrial and cervical cancer evaluation. Awareness of mimics that can simulate both cancers is critical. With careful application, functional MRI with DWI and DCE sequences can help establish a correct diagnosis, although it is sometimes necessary to perform biopsy and histopathological analysis. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Our observations were confirmed in a large variety of solid and haematological malignancies. This test was able to detect dysplasia and carcinomas in situ lesions in different organs and circulating factors in cancer patients years after the removal of their lesions. To our knowledge, this ability is unique and not shared by other liquid biopsy platforms. Immunohistochemistry analysis of the xenotransplants revealed identical patterns of differentiation regardless of the cancer type, showing that differentiation through horizontal transfer might be dependent on the nature of the target cells rather than the type of cancer factors.

Various studies have shown the significance of identifying drug targets for cancer, although this process continues challenging in the field of anti-cancer drug designing. The primary purpose of this study is to design a novel approach to identify target genes for cancer. The sub-network of colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancers were constructed from human protein–protein interaction network. The potential genes were analyzed using hubs and centrality measures. For the identification of target genes, we retrieve those genes that had the highest score in both mutation rates and graph centrality. Moreover, gene deletion analysis revealed that MYC, TP53, and EGFR genes remained potential targets in colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancer respectively. Results suggest that combining network measures with mutation frequencies in cancer genes might assist in recognizing several potential drug targets. Future enhancement of this current approach is to combine these network properties with the biological insights from gene expression data, and their functions will provide a reliable method for rational drug designing. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature." ;

As extracellular matrix, glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) could bind its surface receptor adhesion molecule CD44 which is strongly expressed on breast cancer. We have previously reported a doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded HA-Lys-LA X-NPs (X-NP-DOX) NP delivery system for breast cancer treatment. In this study, we further investigated the antitumor effect of X-NP-DOX NP delivery system using low-dose DOX in both in vitro and in vivo systems. We demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX possessed the ability for inhibiting MCF-7 breast cancer cell growth, invasion, and migration, and inducing apoptosis in vitro. In in vivo experiments, injection of low-dose X-NP-DOX into tumor-bearing mouse resulted in significant reduction of tumor size. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining further revealed that low-dose X-NP-DOX induced higher percentage of apoptotic cells compared with free DOX or saline. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX inhibited Notch1 and Ras/MAPK pathways, decreased cancer stem cell population, and reduced tumorigenesis compared to free DOX in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Owing to its enhanced efficacy and higher targetability compared to free DOX, low-dose DOX delivered by NP system may be a promising novel strategy for breast cancer treatment." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Breast cancer survivors display altered inflammatory responses to immune challenges relative to cancer-naive controls likely due to previous cancer treatments, stress associated with cancer, and/or tumor physiology. Proper inflammatory responses are necessary for adaptive sickness behaviors (e.g., fatigue, anorexia, and fever) and neuroinflammatory pathways are also implicated in mental health disturbances (e.g., cognitive impairment, depression) suffered by cancer patients and survivors. Rodent cancer models indicate that tumors are sufficient to exacerbate neuroinflammatory responses after an immune challenge, however primary tumors are not usually present in cancer survivors, and the behavioral consequences of these brain changes remain understudied. Therefore, we tested the extent to which mammary tumor resection attenuates tumor-induced neuroinflammation and sickness behavior following an immune challenge (i.p. lipopolysaccharide [LPS] injection) in mice. Tnf-α, Il-1β, and Il-6 mRNA decreased in multiple brain regions of LPS-treated tumor-bearing mice relative to LPS-treated controls; tumor resection attenuated these effects in some cases (but not Tnf-α). Tumors also attenuated sickness behaviors (hypothermia and lethargy) compared to LPS-treated controls. Tumor resection reversed these behavioral consequences, although basal body temperature remained elevated, comparable to tumor-bearing mice. Thus, tumors significantly modulate neuroinflammatory pathways with functional consequences and tumor resection mitigates most, but not all, of these changes. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Although substantial advances have been obtained both in treatment and survival rates, there is still a need for new therapeutical approaches. Natural compounds are a realistic source of new bioactive compounds with anticancer activity. Among them, rosemary polyphenols have shown a vast antiproliferative capacity against colon cancer cells in vitro and in animal models. We have investigated the antitumor activity of a rosemary extract (RE) obtained by using supercritical fluid extraction through its capacity to inhibit various signatures of cancer progression and metastasis such as proliferation, migration, invasion and clonogenic survival. RE strongly inhibited proliferation, migration and colony formation of colon cancer cells regardless their phenotype. Treatment with RE led to a sharp increase of intracellular ROS that resulted in necrosis cell death. Nrf2 gene silencing increased RE cytotoxic effects, thus suggesting that this pathway was involved in cell survival. These in vitro results were in line with a reduction of tumor growth by oral administration of RE in a xenograft model of colon cancer cells using athymic nude mice. These findings indicate that targeting colon cancer cells by increasing intracellular ROS and decreasing cell survival mechanisms may suppose a therapeutic option in colon cancer through the combination of rosemary compounds and chemotherapeutic drugs. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Although cure rates are high for early stage disease, clinical outcomes for advanced, metastatic, or recurrent disease remain poor. To change this panorama, a deeper understanding of cervical cancer biology and novel study models are needed. Immortalized human cancer cell lines such as HeLa constitute crucial scientific tools, but there are few other cervical cancer cell lines available, limiting our understanding of a disease known for its molecular heterogeneity. This study aimed to establish novel cervical cancer cell lines derived from Brazilian patients. We successfully established one (HCB-514) out of 35 cervical tumors biopsied. We confirmed the phenotype of HCB-514 by verifying its’ epithelial and tumor origin through cytokeratins, EpCAM and p16 staining. It was also HPV-16 positive. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) showed relevant somatic mutations in several genes including BRCA2, TGFBR1 and IRX2. A copy number variation (CNV) analysis by nanostring and WES revealed amplification of genes mainly related to kinases proteins involved in proliferation, migration and cell differentiation, such as EGFR, PIK3CA, and MAPK7. Overexpression of EGFR was confirmed by phospho RTK-array and validated by western blot analysis. Furthermore, the HCB-514 cell line was sensitive to cisplatin. In summary, this novel Brazilian cervical cancer cell line exhibits relevant key molecular features and constitutes a new biological model for pre-clinical studies. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

To determine how cancer cells adapt to RS, we have monitored the expression of different components of the ATR-CHK1 pathway in primary tumor samples. We show that unlike upstream components of the pathway, the checkpoint mediators Claspin and Timeless are overexpressed in a coordinated manner. Remarkably, reducing the levels of Claspin and Timeless in HCT116 cells to pretumoral levels impeded fork progression without affecting checkpoint signaling. These data indicate that high level of Claspin and Timeless increase RS tolerance by protecting replication forks in cancer cells. Moreover, we report that primary fibroblasts adapt to oncogene-induced RS by spontaneously overexpressing Claspin and Timeless, independently of ATR signaling. Altogether, these data indicate that enhanced levels of Claspin and Timeless represent a gain of function that protects cancer cells from of oncogene-induced RS in a checkpoint-independent manner. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Curcumin, the active polyphenol from turmeric, helps to obstruct the growth of many types of cancers at various stages which include prostrate, melanoma, breast, brain tumor, pancreatic, leukemia, etc. The initiation and recurrence of cancer have been attributed to few mutated cells in bulk of tumor called as cancer stem cells which have the capacity of self-renewal and differentiation. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3B) is a multifunctional serine/threonine protein kinase, originally found in mammals, an important component of diverse signaling pathways, dysregulation of which leads to affect the cancer stem cell properties. The nutritional- and phytochemical-based dietary interventions may complement current chemotherapy to prevent recurrence and relapse of cancer. The objective of present study is to investigate the effect of retinoic acid and curcumin–retinoic acid conjugates against GSK-3B protein.

Endometrial cancers are associated with several critical gene mutations, including PIK3A, PTEN, and KRAS. Different gene mutations in endometrial cancer cells have varied responses to anticancer drugs and cancer therapies. The most frequently altered gene in endometrioid endometrial carcinoma tumors is PTEN. PTEN protein has lipid phosphatase and protein phosphatase activity, as well as other functions in the nucleus. Although the tumor-suppressive function of PTEN has mainly been attributed to its lipid phosphatase activity, a role for PTEN protein phosphatase activity in cell cycle regulation has also been suggested. Various tumor type-specific PTEN mutations are well documented. Here, nine endometrioid endometrial cancer cell lines with PIK3A, PTEN, and KRAS gene mutations were treated with docetaxel and radiation. One mutation with a docetaxel drug-resistant effect was a truncated form of PTEN. Among PTEN mutations in endometrial cancer cells, the Y68 frame shift mutation of PTEN constitutes a major mechanism of resistance to docetaxel treatment. The molecular mechanism involves truncation of the 403 amino acid PTEN protein at amino acid 68 by the Y68 frame shift, leading to the loss of PTEN protein phosphatase and lipid phosphatase activities. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

The present review comprehends the stimuli-responsive polymers and multi-responsiveness with respect to cancer therapy. It focuses on the exploitation of different stimuli like temperature, pH and enzymes responsiveness in a multi-stimuli setting. Nanogels and micelles being two of the most commonly used responsive polymeric carriers have also been discussed. The role of multiple stimuli delivery system is significant due to multiple changes happening in the near surroundings of cancer cells.

In contrast, antibodies to BLV were found in a very small percentage of healthy blood donors. There was no association between BLV DNA and other tumor prognostic biological markers such as hormonal receptors, HER2 oncoprotein, proliferation index, metastasis in sentinels lymph nodes, and tumor grade and size. Our findings suggest that BLV should be considered a potential predisposing factor to breast cancer in women. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Copy number loss of PIK3R1 (p85α) most commonly occurs in ovarian cancer among all cancer types. Here we report that ovarian cancer cells manifest a spectrum of tumorigenic phenotypes upon knockdown of PIK3R1. PIK3R1 loss activates AKT and p110-independent JAK2/STAT3 signaling through inducing changes in the phosphorylation of the docking protein Gab2, thereby relieving the negative inhibition on AKT and promoting the assembly of JAK2/STAT3 signalosome, respectively. Additional mechanisms leading to AKT activation include enhanced p110α kinase activity and a decrease in PTEN level. PIK3R1 loss renders ovarian cancer cells vulnerable to inhibition of AKT or JAK2/STAT3. The combination of AKT and STAT3 inhibitors significantly increases the anti-tumor effect compared to single-agent treatments. Together, our findings provide a rationale for mechanism-based therapeutic approach that targets tumors with loss of PIK3R1. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we perform Repli-Seq and integrated epigenome analyses and demonstrate that genomic regions that undergo long-range epigenetic deregulation in prostate cancer also show concordant differences in replication timing. A subset of altered replication timing domains are conserved across cancers from different tissue origins. Notably, late-replicating regions in cancer cells display a loss of DNA methylation, and a switch in heterochromatin features from H3K9me3-marked constitutive to H3K27me3-marked facultative heterochromatin. Finally, analysis of 214 prostate and 35 breast cancer genomes reveal that late-replicating regions are prone to cis and early-replication to trans chromosomal rearrangements. Together, our data suggests that the nature of chromosomal rearrangement in cancer is related to the spatial and temporal positioning and altered epigenetic states of early-replicating compared to late-replicating loci. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are promising therapies for haematological cancers. Historically, their therapeutic benefit is due to ADC targeting of lineage-restricted antigens. The C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is attractive for targeted therapy of haematological cancers, given its expression in multiple tumour types and role in cancer “homing” to bone marrow. However, CXCR4 is also expressed in haematopoietic cells and other normal tissues, raising safety challenges to the development of anti-CXCR4 ADCs for cancer treatment. Here, we designed the first anti-CXCR4 ADC with favourable therapeutic index, effective in xenografts of haematopoietic cancers resistant to standard of care and anti-CXCR4 antibodies. We screened multiple ADC configurations, by varying type of linker-payload, drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR), affinity and Fc format. The optimal ADC bears a non-cleavable linker, auristatin as payload at DAR = 4 and a low affinity antibody with effector–reduced Fc. Contrary to other drugs targeting CXCR4, anti-CXCR4 ADCs effectively eliminated cancer cells as monotherapy, while minimizing leucocytosis. The optimal ADC selectively eliminated CXCR4 + cancer cells in solid tumours, but showed limited toxicity to normal CXCR4 + tissues, sparing haematopoietic stem cells and progenitors. Our work provides proof-of-concept that through empirical ADC design, it is possible to target proteins with broad normal tissue expression. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Cancers in the bone produce a number of severe symptoms including pain that compromises patient functional status, quality of life, and survival. The source of this pain is multifaceted and includes factors secreted from tumor cells. Malignant cells release the neurotransmitter and cell-signaling molecule glutamate via the oxidative stress-related cystine/glutamate antiporter, system x C − , which reciprocally imports cystine for synthesis of glutathione and the cystine/cysteine redox cycle. Pharmacological inhibition of system x C − has shown success in reducing and delaying the onset of cancer pain-related behavior in mouse models. This investigation describes the development of a stable siRNA-induced knockdown of the functional trans-membrane system x C − subunit xCT (SLC7A11) in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Clones were verified for xCT knockdown at the transcript, protein, and functional levels. RNAseq was performed on a representative clone to comprehensively examine the transcriptional cellular signature in response to xCT knockdown, identifying multiple differentially regulated factors relevant to cancer pain including nerve growth factor, interleukin-1, and colony-stimulating factor-1. Mice were inoculated intrafemorally and recordings of pain-related behaviors including weight bearing, mechanical withdrawal, and limb use were performed. Animals implanted with xCT knockdown cancer cells displayed a delay until the onset of nociceptive behaviors relative to control cells. These results add to the body of evidence suggesting that a reduction in glutamate release from cancers in bone by inhibition of the system x C − transporter may decrease the severe and intractable pain associated with bone metastases. © The Author(s) 2017." ;

Method: For finding the related articles, the researchers searched several databases including PubMed &ProQuest and valid websites including ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Scientific Information Database, and Magiran. The key terms of \"reflexology, cancer, and chemotherapy\" individually and combined together were searched in Parisian and English, and the studies performed from 2009 to 2017 were extracted. Due to the lack of sufficient studies carried out into the outcome of reflexology on chemotherapy, both Persian and English articles were used. Results: A total of 57 studies were extracted from the databases and valid websites; five of which met the inclusion criteria. All selected studies were clinical trials. Implications for Practice: Reflexology can be used as a non-pharmacologic nursing intervention to alleviate the side effects of chemotherapy and improve the quality of life of cancer patients. © 2017 Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

For effective evaluation of this strategy it is crucial to identify which patients are suited for CD47-targeted therapy. In this respect, expression of the pro-phagocytic signal SLAMF7 on both macrophages and cancer cells was recently reported to be a requisite for CD47 antibody-mediated phagocytosis. Here, we demonstrate that in fact SLAMF7 expression on cancer cells is not required and does not impact on CD47 antibody therapy. Moreover, SLAMF7 also does not impact on phagocytosis induction by CD20 antibody rituximab nor associates with overall survival of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma patients. In contrast, expression of CD47 negatively impacts on overall and progression free survival. In conclusion, cancer cell expression of SLAMF7 is not required for phagocytosis and, in contrast to CD47 expression, should not be used as selection criterion for CD47-targeted therapy. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Increased Crabp2 levels have been found in various types of cancer, and are associated with poor patients’ survival. Although Crabp2 is found to be overexpressed in lung cancer, its role in metastasis of lung cancer is unclear. In this study, Crabp2 was overexpressed in high-metastatic C10F4 than low-metastatic lung cancer cells. Analysis of clinical samples revealed that high CRABP2 levels were correlated with lymph node metastases, poor overall survival, and increased recurrence. Knockdown of Crabp2 decreased migration, invasion, anoikis resistance, and in vivo metastasis. Crabp2 was co-immunoprecipitated with HuR, and overexpression of Crabp2 increased HuR levels, which promoted integrin β1/FAK/ERK signaling. Inhibition of HuR or integrin β1/FAK/ERK signaling reversed the promoting effect of Crabp2 in migration, invasion, and anoikis resistance. Knockdown of Crabp2 further inhibited the growth of cancer cells as compared with that by gemcitabine or irinotecan alone. The expression of Crabp2 in human lung tumors was correlated with stress marker CHOP. In conclusion, our findings have identified the promoting role of Crabp2 in anoikis resistance and metastasis. CRABP2 may serve as a prognostic marker and targeting CRABP2 may be exploited as a modality to reduce metastasis. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "SPG-56 is a newly isolated glycoprotein from sweet potatoes (Zhongshu NO. 1), but its value for suppressing breast cancer progression remains unknown. This study was designed to investigate the potential anti-cancer effects of SPG-56, which consists of 2.9% sugar and 97.1% protein. The effects of SPG-56 on the proliferation and apoptosis of breast cancer cells were determined using CCK-8 and Hoechst 33342 assays and flow cytometry, after staining with Annexin V and PI respectively. The activities of SPG-56 against breast cancer were examined using female BALB/c nude mice orthotopically implanted with human breast carcinoma cells of the types MCF-7 and 4T1-Luc. The cellular experiments showed that SPG-56 inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of MCF-7 cells dose- and time-dependently. Oral administration of SPG-56 significantly suppressed the development of MCF-7 tumor cells (P < 0.01) as compared with an untreated group. The serum tumor markers CEA, CA125 and CA153 in a 240 mg/kg/d SPG-56 decreased by 54.8%, 91.8%, and 90.3%, respectively. The experiments further demonstrated that SPG-56 inhibited the metastasis of breast cancer in MCF-7 and 4T1-bearing mice by altering the expression of MMP2, MMP9, VEGF, Occludin and Claudin. It is concluded that SPG-56 may have potential as a novel anti-tumor candidate for breast cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Lymph node metastasis is of major prognostic significance for breast cancer. Lymph node metastasis arises at a very early stage in some patients. Using the data downloaded from the TCGA database, we studied the differences between primary tumors with and without lymph node metastasis at the multi-omics level using bioinformatics approaches. Our study found that low mutation and neoantigen burdens correlated with lymph node metastazation of breast cancer. All three conserved domains in TP53 were mutated in lymph node-negative breast cancers, whereas only one domain was mutated in lymph node-positive samples. Mutations in microtubule-related proteins appear to help immune cells recognize tumors and inhibit their lymph node metastasis. Destroying microtubule-related proteins is a potential therapeutic strategy to inhibit lymph node metastasis of breast cancer. As the neoantigens specifically present in lymph node-positive breast cancers, MAPK10, BC9L, TRIM65, CD93, KITLG, CNPPD1, CPED1, CCDC146, TMEM185A, INO80D, and PSMD11 are potential targets for vaccine design. In the tumor microenvironment, reduced numbers of effector immune cells, especially activated memory CD4+ T cells and activated mast cells, facilitate breast cancer metastasis to the lymph nodes. According to transcriptome data, lymph node metastasis was mostly driven by gene mutation rather than by gene expression. Although differential gene expression analysis was based on lymph node metastasis status, many genes were shown to be differentially expressed based on estrogen receptor status. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Fibroblasts turn into cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumour microenvironment. CAFs have recently attracted attention for their function as a regulator of immune cell recruitment and function in addition to their tumour-promoting roles. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of CAFs on monocyte recruitment and macrophage polarization in breast cancer. CAFs, which were α-SMA expressing fibroblasts in contrast to normal fibroblasts (NFs), effectively recruited monocytes. Recruitment of monocytes by CAFs might be mediated by monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) as well as stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) cytokines. CAFs differentiated the recruited monocytes into M2-like macrophages which are capable of exerting their immunosuppressive roles via the PD-1 axis. CAF-educated monocytes exhibited strong immune suppression unlike NF-educated monocytes and enhanced the motility/invasion of breast cancer cells in addition to increasing the expressions of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes and vimentin protein in cancer cells. CAF-educated M1 macrophages displayed increased expression of M2 markers and production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in contrast to decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12 compared with control M1 macrophages; suggesting that CAFs were also able to induce the trans-differentiation of M1 macrophages to M2 macrophages. We then investigated the relationship between the infiltration of CAFs and tumour associated macrophages (TAMs) using tissue samples obtained from breast cancer patients. High grade of CAFs significantly correlated with the number of TAMs in human breast cancer tissue samples. It was also associated with higher Ki-67 proliferation index, and higher tumour volume. This result is in line with our finding of increased breast cancer cell proliferation due to the effects of CAF-educated monocytes in vitro. Our results concluded that CAFs play pivotal roles in sculpturing the tumour microenvironment in breast cancer, and therapeutic strategies to reverse the CAF-mediated immunosuppressive microenvironment should be taken into consideration. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

We construct iCells of four cancers and the corresponding tissue controls and identify the most rewired genes in cancer. Many of them are of unknown function and cannot be identified as different in cancer in any specific molecular network. We biologically validate that they have a role in cancer by knockdown experiments followed by cell viability assays. We find additional support through Kaplan-Meier survival curves of thousands of patients. Finally, we extend this analysis to uncover pan-cancer genes.

The increasing popularity of sequencing technologies motivates the in-silico identification of CCLs based on their mutational fingerprint, but care must be taken when identifying heterogeneous data. We recently developed the proof-of-concept Uniquorn 1 method which could reliably identify heterogeneous sequencing data from selected sequencing technologies. Here we present Uniquorn 2, a generic and robust in-silico identification method for CCLs with DNA/RNA-seq and panel-seq information. We benchmarked Uniquorn 2 by cross-identifying 1612 RNA and 3596 panel-sized NGS profiles derived from 1516 CCLs, five repositories, four technologies and three major cancer panel-designs. Our method achieves an accuracy of 96% for RNA-seq and 95% for mixed DNA-seq and RNA-seq identification. Even for a panel of only 94 cancer-related genes, accuracy remains at 82% but decreases when using smaller panels.

In this ex vivo study of nine fresh human colon specimens, we report the first use of quantified subsurface scattering coefficient maps acquired by swept-source optical coherence tomography to reveal subsurface abnormities. We generate subsurface scattering coefficient maps with a novel wavelet-based-curve-fitting method that provides significantly improved accuracy. The angular spectra of scattering coefficient maps of normal tissues exhibit a spatial feature distinct from those of abnormal tissues. An angular spectrum index to quantify the differences between the normal and abnormal tissues is derived, and its strength in revealing subsurface cancer in ex vivo samples is statistically analyzed. The study demonstrates that the angular spectrum of the scattering coefficient map can effectively reveal subsurface colorectal cancer and potentially provide a fast and more accurate diagnosis. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Current options in palliation such as hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) present severe side effects. Recent research efforts suggested the therapeutic use of oxidant-enriched liquid using cold physical plasma. To investigate a clinically accepted treatment regimen, we assessed the antitumor capacity of plasma-treated saline solution. In response to such liquid, CT26 murine colon cancer cells were readily oxidized and showed cell growth with subsequent apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and upregulation of immunogenic cell death (ICD) markers in vitro. This was accompanied by marked morphological changes with re-arrangement of actin fibers and reduced motility. Induction of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype was not observed. Key results were confirmed in MC38 colon and PDA6606 pancreatic cancer cells. Compared to plasma-treated saline, hydrogen peroxide was inferiorly toxic in 3D tumor spheroids but of similar efficacy in 2D models. In vivo, plasma-treated saline decreased tumor burden in Balb/C mice. This was concomitant with elevated numbers of intratumoral macrophages and increased T cell activation following incubation with CT26 cells ex vivo. Being a potential adjuvant for HIPEC therapy, our results suggest oxidizing saline solutions to inactivate colon cancer cells while potentially stimulating antitumor immune responses. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Although solid fuel combustion emissions are known to increase the prevalence of illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer, however, their effect on the eyes is underexplored. This study assesses the acute toxicity of solid fuel combustion emissions on healthy ocular cells and a cancer cell line. Three healthy ocular cell lines (corneal, lens, and retinal epithelial cells) and a cancer cell line (Chinese hamster ovary cells) were exposed to liquid and gas phase emissions from applewood and coal combustion. Following the exposure, real-time cell attachment behavior was monitored for at least 120 hours with electrical cell impedance spectroscopy. The viability of the cells, amount of apoptotic cells, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were quantified with MTT, ApoTox-Glo, and ROS-Glo H 2 O 2 assays, respectively. The results showed that coal emissions compromised the viability of ocular cells more than applewood emissions. Interestingly, the cancer cells, although their viability was not compromised, generated 1.7 to 2.7 times more ROS than healthy cells. This acute exposure study provides compelling proof that biomass combustion emissions compromise the viability of ocular cells and increase ROS generation. The increased ROS generation was fatal for ocular cells, but it promoted the growth of cancer cells. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

The goal of this study was to classify mice with and without tumors and compare tumors localized to the mammary pad and tumor cells injected into the iliac artery by differences in VOCs in urine. After 4T1.2 tumor cells were injected into BALB/c mice either in the mammary pad or into the iliac artery, urine was collected, VOCs from urine headspace were concentrated by solid phase microextraction and results were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry quadrupole time-of-flight. Multivariate and univariate statistical analyses were employed to find potential biomarkers for breast cancer and metastatic breast cancer in mice models. A set of six VOCs classified mice with and without tumors with an area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC AUC) of 0.98 (95% confidence interval [0.85, 1.00]) via five-fold cross validation.

Moreover, the high drug loading capacity of Cet-SLN was employed to encapsulate photothermal agent indocyanine green (ICG) to finally fabricate a versatile drug delivery system (DDS) able to co-deliver Cet and ICG (Cet-SLN/ICG) for combinational chemo-photothermal therapy of breast cancer. The obtained results clearly demonstrated that Cet-SLN/ICG was well-dispersed nanoparticles with preferable stability under physiological condition. Furthermore, due to the conjugation of Cet, Cet-SLN/ICG could target EGFR which overexpress in MCF-7 cells. Most importantly, both in vitro and in vivo results suggested that compared with Cet or ICG alone, the Cet-SLN/ICG showed superior anticancer efficacy.

        fabio:abstract    "The integration of genomic and DNA methylation data has been demonstrated as a powerful strategy in understanding cancer mechanisms and identifying therapeutic targets. The TCGA consortium has mapped DNA methylation in thousands of cancer samples using Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 K BeadChip (Illumina 450 K array) that only covers about 1.5% of CpGs in the human genome. Therefore, increasing the coverage of the DNA methylome would significantly leverage the usage of the TCGA data. Here, we present a new model called EAGLING that can expand the Illumina 450 K array data 18 times to cover about 30% of the CpGs in the human genome. We applied it to analyze 13 cancers in TCGA. By integrating the expanded methylation, gene expression, and somatic mutation data, we identified the genes showing differential patterns in each of the 13 cancers. Many of the triple-evidenced genes identified in majority of the cancers are biomarkers or potential biomarkers. Pan-cancer analysis also revealed the pathways in which the triple-evidenced genes are enriched, which include well known ones as well as new ones, such as axonal guidance signaling pathway and pathways related to inflammatory processing or inflammation response. Triple-evidenced genes, particularly TNXB, RRM2, CELSR3, SLC16A3, FANCI, MMP9, MMP11, SIK1, and TRIM59 showed superior predictive power in both tumor diagnosis and prognosis. These results have demonstrated that the integrative analysis using the expanded methylation data is powerful in identifying critical genes/pathways that may serve as new therapeutic targets. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "A key challenge facing immunotherapy is poor infiltration of T cells into tumors, along with suppression of cells reaching these sites. However, macrophages make up a majority of immune cell infiltrates into tumors, creating natural targets for immunotherapies able to direct macrophages away from tumor-supportive functions and toward anti-tumor phenotypes. Recent studies demonstrate that toll-like receptors (TLRs) – pathways that quickly trigger early immune responses – play an important role in polarizing macrophages. Here, we present emerging ways in which TLR signaling is being manipulated in macrophages to create new opportunities for cancer immunotherapy. In particular, we discuss approaches to deliver TLR agonists, to leverage biomaterials in these therapies, and to couple TLR-based approaches with other frontline treatments as combination cancer therapies. © 2017" ;

However, immune checkpoint inhibitors are only advantageous for a limited population of cancer patients. Therefore, companion diagnostics are needed in order to identify patients for whom these therapies are effective. In the present study, we evaluated detailed immunological aspects in clinical specimens from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. We analyzed the immune profiles, T cell cytotoxicity, and TCR repertoire of peripheral blood, normal lung tissue, and tumor tissue from NSCLC patients. By using bispecific T-cell engager technology to assess the cytotoxicity of T cells, we found that the cytotoxicity of tumor-infiltrated T cells closely correlated with that of peripheral T cells. This correlation was supported by the immune profiles, cytokine production, and results of the TCR repertoire analysis from these specimens. We also found that the cytotoxicity of peripheral T cells has potential as a predictor of the effects of nivolumab in the tumor microenvironment. These results imply further applications to blood-based immune monitoring systems and predictive biomarkers for cancer immunotherapy. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

This standard procedure relies on the slow radioactivity loss, usually attributed to the limited tumour expression of G6P-phosphatase (G6Pase). However, this classical interpretation intrinsically represents an approximation since, as in all tissues, cancer G6Pase activity is remarkable and is confined to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whose lumen must be reached by phosphorylated FDG to explain its hydrolysis and radioactivity release. The present study tested the impact of G6Pase sequestration on the mathematical description of FDG trafficking and handling in cultured cancer cells. Our data show that accounting for tracer access to the ER configures this compartment as the preferential site of FDG accumulation. This is confirmed by the reticular localization of fluorescent FDG analogues. Remarkably enough, reticular accumulation rate of FDG is dependent upon extracellular glucose availability, thus configuring the same ER as a significant determinant of cancer glucose metabolism. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Although current methods of treatment for cervical cancer can ablate lesions, preventing metastatic disseminations and excessive tissue injuries still remains a major concern. Hence, development of a safer and more efficient treatment modality is of vital importance. Natural products from plants are one of the principal sources of precursors to lead compounds with direct pharmaceutical application across all disease classes. One of these plants is Ficus carica, whose fruit latex, when applied on HPV-induced skin warts, has shown potential as a possible cure for this virus related lesions. This study explores the in vitro biological activities of fig latex and elucidates its possible mechanisms of action on cervical cancer cell lines CaSki and HeLa positive for HPV type 16 and 18, respectively. Our data shows that fig latex inhibits properties that are associated with HPV-positive cervical cancer transformed cells such as rapid growth and invasion and substantially downregulated the expression of p16 and HPV onco-proteins E6, E7. These findings suggest Ficus carica latex has the potential to be used in the development of therapeutic modalities for the possible treatment, cure and prevention of HPV related cervical cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing methods, the diversity and composition of the microbiota from ovarian cancer tissues (25 samples) and normal distal fallopian tube tissues (25 samples) were analyzed. High-throughput sequencing showed that the diversity and richness indexes were significantly decreased in ovarian cancer tissues compared to tissues from normal distal fallopian tubes. The ratio of the two phyla for Proteobacteria/Firmicutes was notably increased in ovarian cancer, which revealed that microbial composition change might be associated with the process of ovarian cancer development. In addition, transcriptome-sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses suggested that the transcriptional profiles were statistically different between ovarian carcinoma and normal distal fallopian tubes. Moreover, a set of genes including 84 different inflammation-associated or immune-associated genes, which had been named as the human antibacterial-response genes were also modulated expression. Therefore, we hypothesize that the microbial composition change, as a novel risk factor, may be involving the initiation and progression of ovarian cancer via influencing and regulating the local immune microenvironment of fallopian tubes except for regular pathways. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Several pioneering work have established that apart from genetic alterations, epigenetic modifications contribute significantly in tumor progression. Remarkable role of EZH2 in cancer highlights the importance of identifying its targets. Although much emphasis has been placed in recent years in designing drugs and inhibitors targeting EZH2, less effort has been given in exploring its existing targets that will help in understanding the oncogenic role of EZH2 in turn which may provide a more stringent method of targeting EZH2. In the present study, we validated six direct targets of EZH2 that are GPNMB, PMEPA1, CoL5A1, VGLL4, POMT2 and SUMF1 associated with cancer related pathways. Upon EZH2 knockdown, more than two fold increase in the target gene expression was evident. CHIP-qPCR performed in both MCF-7 and MDA-MDA-231 confirmed the in-vivo binding of EZH2 on its identified target. Thirty invasive breast carcinoma cases with their adjacent normal tissues were included in the study. Immunohistochemistry in primary breast tumor tissue array showed tumor dependent expression of EZH2. Array of MERAV expression database revealed the strength of association of EZH2 with its target genes. Real time PCR performed with RNA extracted from breast tumor tissues further authenticated the existing negative correlation between EZH2 and its target genes. Pearson correlation coefficient & statistical significance computed using the matrix provided in the database strengthened the negative correlation between identified target genes and EZH2. KM plotter analysis showed improved relapse-free survival with increased expression of PMEPA1, POMT2, VGLL4 and SUMF1 in breast cancer patients indicating their therapeutic potential. While investigating the relevance of these target genes, different mutations of them were found in breast cancer patients. Seeking the clinical relevance of our study, following our recent publication that reports the role of EZH2 in nicotine-mediated breast cancer development and progression, we observed significant reduced expression of SUMF1 in breast cancer patient samples with smoking history in comparison to never-smoked patient samples. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we report that TOP1MT is overexpressed in cancer tissues and demonstrate that TOP1MT deficiency attenuates tumor growth in human and mouse models of colon and liver cancer. Due to their mitochondrial dysfunction, TOP1MT-KO cells become addicted to glycolysis, which limits synthetic building blocks and energy supply required for the proliferation of cancer cells in a nutrient-deprived tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, we show that TOP1MT associates with mitoribosomal subunits, ensuring optimal mitochondrial translation and assembly of oxidative phosphorylation complexes that are critical for sustaining tumor growth. The TOP1MT genomic signature profile, based on Top1mt-KO liver cancers, is correlated with enhanced survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients.

A new data integrative approach, based on graphical models, was applied on our multi-modal –omics, and clinical data cohort of metastatic melanoma patients. We found that response to chemotherapy is directly linked to ten gene expression, four methylation variables and PARP1 SNP rs1805407. PARP1 is a DNA repair gene critical for chemotherapy response and for which FDA-approved inhibitors are clinically available (olaparib). We demonstrated that two PARP inhibitors (ABT-888 and olaparib) make SNP carrier cancer cells of various histologic subtypes more sensitive to alkylating agents, but they have no effect in wild-type cells. Furthermore, PARP1 inhibitors act synergistically with chemotherapy in SNP carrier cells (especially in ovarian cancer for which olaparib is FDA-approved), but they are additive at best in wild-type cancer cells. Taken together, our results suggest that the combination of chemotherapy and PARP1 inhibition may benefit the carriers of rs1805407 in the future and may be used in personalized therapy strategies to select patients that are more likely to respond to PARP inhibitors. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Earlier studies have shown that bovine α -lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells (BAMLET) becomes cytotoxic against cancer cells in complex with oleic acid {Hoque, M. et. al., PLoSOne8, e68390 (2013)}. In our study, we obtained bovine α-lactalbumin complexed with lanthanum ion (La 3+ -B-α-LA) and determined its high resolution crystal structure. The natural calcium binding site of bovine α-lactalbumin is replaced by lanthanum. The La 3+ complex formation by B-α-apo-LA was also supported by various biophysical methods. Interestingly, our complex, La 3+ -B-α-LA exhibits much greater anticancer activity against breast cancer cells as compared to the reported BAMLET-oleic acid complex. This study shows that La 3+ -B-α-LA complex is preferentially more toxic to MCF-7 cells as compared to KB (oral cancer) and HeLa (cervical) cells, while almost non-toxic to the healthy cells that we studied. Our data indicates that the cytotoxicity of La 3+ -B-α-LA against cancer cells is through apoptotic path way. The higher anticancer activity of La 3+ -B-α-LA is attributable to the requisite structural changes induced in the protein by La 3+ binding as supported by the crystal structure of the complex. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

However, no studies have evaluated vascular pain in patients with colorectal cancer in relation to peripheral venous administration of chemotherapy with or without oxaliplatin. We evaluated oxaliplatin-induced vascular pain using subjective and objective methods. We determined if oxaliplatin induced vascular pain in patients with colorectal cancer using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and a PainVision PS-2100 device. We compared VAS score between chemotherapy regimens with or without oxaliplatin, and between genders. We also examined the correlations of VAS score with pain intensity examined by the PainVision PS-2100, and with age and vessel diameter. A total of 98 patients with colorectal cancer were enrolled in this study, including 78 patients who received oxaliplatin via peripheral venous administration and 20 who received chemotherapy without oxaliplatin. The median VAS scores in patients with and without oxaliplatin were 36.5 (interquartile range 9.0–60.0) and 0 (0–4.0), respectively (P < 0.001), and the median pain intensities according to PainVision were 43.5 (14.3–98) and 36.5 (9.3–58.5), respectively (P < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between VAS and pain intensity (r = 0.584), but no correlation between VAS score and age (r = −0.174) or vessel diameter (r = −0.107). Peripheral venous administration of oxaliplatin induced vascular pain, measured both subjectively and objectively, in patients with colorectal cancer, regardless of vessel diameter. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Primary bronchial cancer accounts for almost 20% of all cancer death worldwide. One of the emerging techniques with tremendous power for lung cancer therapy is magnetic aerosol drug targeting (MADT). The use of a permanent magnet for effective drug delivery in a desired location throughout the lung requires extensive optimization, but it has not been addressed yet. In the present study, the possibility of using a permanent magnet for trapping the particles on a lung tumor is evaluated numerically in the Weibel's model from G0 to G3. The effect of different parameters is considered on the efficiency of particle deposition in a tumor located on a distant position of the lung bronchi and bronchioles. Also, the effective position of the magnetic source, tumor size, and location are the objectives for particle deposition. The results show that a limited particle deposition occurs on the lung branches in passive targeting. However, the incorporation of a permanent magnet next to the tumor enhanced the particle deposition fraction on G2 to up to 49% for the particles of 7 µm diameter. Optimizing the magnet size could also improve the particle deposition fraction by 68%. It was also shown that the utilization of MADT is essential for effective drug delivery to the tumors located on the lower wall of airway branches given the dominance of the air velocity and resultant drag force in this region. The results demonstrated the high competence and necessity of MADT as a noninvasive drug delivery method for lung cancer therapy." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. Adjuvant chemotherapy has significantly reduced mortality but increased cognitive impairments, including attention function, making quality of life issues a crucial concern. This study enrolled nineteen breast cancer patients who were treated with standard chemotherapy within 6 months and 20 sex-matched healthy controls to investigate the brain effects of chemotherapy. All participants underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) with mean fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (mfALFF) analysis and were correlated with neuropsychological tests, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised (CAMS-R), and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), to explore the possible underlying mechanism of cognitive alternations. We found increased mfALFF over the frontoparietal lobe and decreased mfALFF over the occipital lobe in the cancer patients compared with the healthy controls; the altered brain regions may be associated with the dorsal attention network (DAN) and may be explained by a compensatory mechanism. Both MMSE and CAMS-R scores showed a positive correlation with mfALFF in the occipital lobe but a negative correlation in the frontoparietal lobe. By contrast, IES-R scores showed a positive correlation with mfALFF in the frontoparietal lobe but a negative correlation in the occipital lobe. These alterations are potentially related to the effects of both chemotherapy and psychological distress. Future research involving a larger sample size of patients with breast cancer is recommended. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

In the case of mutations in individual genes that cause them to be incorrectly spliced, engineered splicing factors can be introduced to correct splicing of these aberrant transcripts and reduce the effects of the disease phenotype. Mutations that occur in certain splicing factor genes themselves have been implicated in many cancers, particularly myelodysplastic syndromes. Small molecules that target splicing factors have been developed as therapies to preferentially induce apoptosis in these cancer cells. Specifically, drugs targeting the splicing factor SF3B1 have led to recent clinical trials.

Analysis of AA-reconstructed amplicons in a pan-cancer dataset reveals many novel properties of copy number amplifications in cancer. These findings support a model in which focal amplifications arise due to the formation and replication of extrachromosomal DNA. Applying AA to 68 viral-mediated cancer samples, we identify a large fraction of amplicons with specific structural signatures suggestive of hybrid, human-viral extrachromosomal DNA.

There have been many attempts to identify markers and key pathways induced throughout EMT but the process is complex and depends on the cancer type and tumour microenvironment. Here we used the colon cancer cell line HT29, which stably overexpressed Snail, the key transcription factor in early EMT, as a model for colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with a pro-metastatic phenotype. We investigated miRNA expression regulation during that phenotypic switching. We found that overexpression of Snail in HT29 cells triggered significant changes in individual miRNA levels but did not change the global efficiency of miRNA processing. Snail abundance repressed the expression of miR-192 and miR-194 and increased miR-205, let-7i and SNORD13 levels. These identified changes correlated with the reported transcriptomic alterations in Snail-overexpressing HT29 cells. We also investigated how Snail affected the miRNA content of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from HT29 cells. Our data suggest that the presence of Snail significantly alters the complex mRNA/miRNA interactions in the early steps of metastasis and also has an impact on the content of EVs released from HT29 cells. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

This retrospective case-control study compared patients who had lung cancer with PJP (n = 112) or without PJP (n = 336) matched according to age, sex, histopathology, and stage. PJP definition was based on (i) positive PCR or direct immunofluorescence results for pneumocystis, (ii) clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities that were consistent with a pneumonic process, and (iii) received targeted PJP treatment. The development of PJP was associated with radiotherapy (RTx), concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRTx), lymphopenia, and prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (20 mg of prednisolone equivalent per day for ≥3 weeks). Multivariate analysis revealed independent associations with prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06–3.63; p = 0.032) and CCRTx (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.27–3.43; p = 0.004). Steroid use was frequently related to RTx pneumonitis or esophagitis (29 patients, 43.3%). Prolonged high-dose steroid therapy and CCRTx were risk factors for PJP development among patients with lung cancer. As these patients had a poor prognosis, clinicians should consider PJP prophylaxis for high-risk patients with lung cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

We performed an in silico analysis to determine the concordance in the frequencies of actionable mutations and copy number alterations/aberrations (CNAs) in the two most common breast cancer histologies, invasive lobular and invasive ductal carcinoma. We found that targeted sequencing identified a larger number of mutational hotspots and clinically significant amplifications that would have been missed by WES and SNP arrays in many actionable genes such as PIK3CA, EGFR, AKT3, FGFR1, ERBB2, ERBB3 and ESR1. The striking differences between the number of mutational hotspots and CNAs generated from these platforms highlight a number of factors that should be considered in the interpretation of array and NGS-based genomic data for precision medicine.

Several oxaliplatin transporters were previously identified but their relative contributions to determining oxaliplatin tumour responses and gastrointestinal tumour cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin remains unclear. We studied clinical associations between tumour expression of oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes and patient response to oxaliplatin, then experimentally verified associations found with MRP2 in models of human gastrointestinal cancer. Among 18 oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes, MRP2 was the only one to be differentially expressed in the tumours of colorectal cancer patients who did or did not respond to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Over-expression of MRP2 (endogenously in HepG2 and PANC-1 cells, or induced by stable transfection of HEK293 cells) decreased oxaliplatin accumulation and cytotoxicity but those deficits were reversed by inhibition of MRP2 with myricetin or siRNA knockdown. Mice bearing subcutaneous HepG2 tumour xenografts were sensitised to oxaliplatin antitumour activity by concurrent myricetin treatment with little or no increase in toxicity. In conclusion, MRP2 limits oxaliplatin accumulation and response in human gastrointestinal cancer.

We compare optimized gene signatures for cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin responses in the same cell lines and validate each signature using data from patients with cancer. Supervised support vector machine learning is used to derive gene sets whose expression is related to the cell line GI50 values by backwards feature selection with cross-validation. Specific genes and functional pathways distinguishing sensitive from resistant cell lines are identified by contrasting signatures obtained at extreme and median GI50 thresholds. Ensembles of gene signatures at different thresholds are combined to reduce the dependence on specific GI50 values for predicting drug responses. The most accurate gene signatures for each platin are: cisplatin: BARD1, BCL2, BCL2L1, CDKN2C, FAAP24, FEN1, MAP3K1, MAPK13, MAPK3, NFKB1, NFKB2, SLC22A5, SLC31A2, TLR4, and TWIST1; carboplatin: AKT1, EIF3K, ERCC1, GNGT1, GSR, MTHFR, NEDD4L, NLRP1, NRAS, RAF1, SGK1, TIGD1, TP53, VEGFB, and VEGFC; and oxaliplatin: BRAF, FCGR2A, IGF1, MSH2, NAGK, NFE2L2, NQO1, PANK3, SLC47A1, SLCO1B1, and UGT1A1. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with bladder, ovarian, and colorectal cancer were used to test the cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin signatures, resulting in 71.0%, 60.2%, and 54.5% accuracies in predicting disease recurrence and 59%, 61%, and 72% accuracies in predicting remission, respectively. One cisplatin signature predicted 100% of recurrence in non-smoking patients with bladder cancer (57% disease-free; N = 19), and 79% recurrence in smokers (62% disease-free; N = 35).

MTH1 dephosphorylates oxidized nucleotides, thereby preventing their incorporation into DNA and protecting tumour cells from oxidative DNA damage. Inhibitors of MTH1 (TH588 and (S)-crizotinib) were shown to reduce cancer cell viability. However, the MTH1-dependency of the anti-cancer effects of these drugs has recently been questioned. Here, we have assessed anti-tumour effects of TH588 and (S)-crizotinib in patient-derived 3D colorectal cancer cultures. Hypoxia and reoxygenation – conditions that increase intracellular ROS levels – increased sensitivity to (S)-crizotinib, but not to TH588. (S)-crizotinib reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-MET and ErbB3 whereas TH588 induced a mitotic cell cycle arrest, which was not affected by adding ROS-modulating compounds. Furthermore, we show that both compounds induced DNA damage that could not be prevented by adding the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Moreover, adding ROS-modulating compounds did not alter the reduction in viability in response to TH588 and (S)-crizotinib. We conclude that TH588 and (S)-crizotinib have very clear and distinct anti-tumour effects in 3D colorectal cancer cultures, but that these effects most likely occur through distinct and ROS-independent mechanisms. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Iron deposits are a phenotypic trait of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Histological iron imaging and contrast-agent free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect these deposits, but their presence in human cancer, and correlation with immunotherapeutic response is largely untested. Here, primarily using these iron imaging approaches, we evaluated the spatial distribution of polarized macrophage populations containing high endogenous levels of iron in preclinical murine models and human breast cancer, and used them as metabolic biomarkers to correlate TAM infiltration with response to immunotherapy in preclinical trials. Macrophage-targeted inhibition of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) by immunotherapy was confirmed to inhibit macrophage accumulation and slow mammary tumor growth in mouse models while also reducing hemosiderin iron-laden TAM accumulation as measured by both iron histology and in vivo iron MRI (FeMRI). Spatial profiling of TAM iron deposit infiltration defined regions of maximal accumulation and response to the CSF1R inhibitor, and revealed differences between microenvironments of human cancer according to levels of polarized macrophage iron accumulation in stromal margins. We therefore demonstrate that iron deposition serves as an endogenous metabolic imaging biomarker of TAM infiltration in breast cancer that has high translational potential for evaluation of immunotherapeutic response. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "More than 50% of colon cancers bear mutations in p53, one of the most important tumor suppressors, and its family members p63 or p73 are expected to contribute to inhibiting the progression of colon cancers. The AP2 family also acts as a tumor suppressor. Here we found that p73 and AP2 are able to activate NEU4, a neuraminidase gene, which removes the terminal sialic acid residues from cancer-associated glycans. Under serum starvation, NEU4 was up-regulated and one of the NEU4 target glycans, sialyl Lewis X, was decreased, whereas p73 and AP2 were up-regulated. Sialyl Lewis X levels were not, however, decreased under starvation conditions in p73- or AP2-knockdown cells. p53 and AP2 underwent protein-protein interactions, exerting synergistic effects to activate p21, and interaction of p53 with AP2 was lost in cells expressing the L350P mutation of p53. The homologous residues in p63 and p73 are L423 and L377, respectively. The synergistic effect of p53/p63 with AP2 to activate genes was lost with the L350P/L423P mutation in p53/p63, but p73 bearing the L377P mutation was able to interact with AP2 and exerted its normal synergistic effects. We propose that p73 and AP2 synergistically activate the NEU4 promoter in colon cancer cells. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Nanoparticles prepared by single emulsion method had a size of less than 300 nm with 70.7 ± 3.9% reaction yield and 26.4 ± 1.1% Hsp loading capacity. Treatment of C6 glioma cells with HspNPs for 24 and 48 h resulted in dose- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability, with approximate IC50 of 28 and 21 μg/mL, respectively (p = .036 for 24 h, p = .025 for 48 h). The percentage of PCNA positive cells decreased to 20% and 10%, respectively, for Hsp- and HspNP-treated cells at concentration of 100 µg/mL. Treatment with increasing concentrations of HspNPs (25, 50, 75 and 100 µg/mL) resulted in 9.1-, 7-, 12.5- and 12.7-fold in increase in apoptotic cell number. Optimum doses of Hsp and HspNPs were found to increase oxidative damage in C6 glioma cells. MDA levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were found to be significantly elevated at 75 and 100 µg/mL exposure concentration of HspNPs with (p = .002) and (p = .018), respectively for 48-h treatment. The results obtained with this study showed biocompatible polymeric nanoparticle systems has great advantages to enhance anti-cancer activity and poor solubility of therapeutic agents. Overall our findings suggest that Hsp-loaded PLGA nanoparticle systems showed significant anti-cancer activity and HspNPs could be used as promising novel anti-cancer agent." ;

GO exhibits pH-dependent fluorescence emission in the visible/near-infrared, providing a possibility of molecular imaging and pH-sensing. It is also water soluble and has a substantial platform for functionalization, allowing for the delivery of multiple therapeutics. GO physical properties are modified to enhance cellular internalization, producing fluorescent nanoflakes with low (<15%) cytotoxicity at the imaging concentrations of 15 μg/mL. As a result, at lower flake sizes GO rapidly internalizes into HeLa cells with the following 70% fluorescence based clearance at 24 h, assessed by its characteristic emission in red/near-IR. pH-dependence of GO emission is utilized to provide the sensing of acidic extracellular environments of cancer cells. The results demonstrate diminishing green/red (550/630 nm) fluorescence intensity ratios for HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells in comparison to HEK-293 healthy cells suggesting a potential use of GO as a non-invasive optical sensor for cancer microenvironments.

There have been many attempts to identify markers and key pathways induced throughout EMT but the process is complex and depends on the cancer type and tumour microenvironment. Here we used the colon cancer cell line HT29, which stably overexpressed Snail, the key transcription factor in early EMT, as a model for colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with a pro-metastatic phenotype. We investigated miRNA expression regulation during that phenotypic switching. We found that overexpression of Snail in HT29 cells triggered significant changes in individual miRNA levels but did not change the global efficiency of miRNA processing. Snail abundance repressed the expression of miR-192 and miR-194 and increased miR-205, let-7i and SNORD13 levels. These identified changes correlated with the reported transcriptomic alterations in Snail-overexpressing HT29 cells. We also investigated how Snail affected the miRNA content of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from HT29 cells. Our data suggest that the presence of Snail significantly alters the complex mRNA/miRNA interactions in the early steps of metastasis and also has an impact on the content of EVs released from HT29 cells. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

This retrospective case-control study compared patients who had lung cancer with PJP (n = 112) or without PJP (n = 336) matched according to age, sex, histopathology, and stage. PJP definition was based on (i) positive PCR or direct immunofluorescence results for pneumocystis, (ii) clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities that were consistent with a pneumonic process, and (iii) received targeted PJP treatment. The development of PJP was associated with radiotherapy (RTx), concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRTx), lymphopenia, and prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (20 mg of prednisolone equivalent per day for ≥3 weeks). Multivariate analysis revealed independent associations with prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06–3.63; p = 0.032) and CCRTx (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.27–3.43; p = 0.004). Steroid use was frequently related to RTx pneumonitis or esophagitis (29 patients, 43.3%). Prolonged high-dose steroid therapy and CCRTx were risk factors for PJP development among patients with lung cancer. As these patients had a poor prognosis, clinicians should consider PJP prophylaxis for high-risk patients with lung cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

We performed an in silico analysis to determine the concordance in the frequencies of actionable mutations and copy number alterations/aberrations (CNAs) in the two most common breast cancer histologies, invasive lobular and invasive ductal carcinoma. We found that targeted sequencing identified a larger number of mutational hotspots and clinically significant amplifications that would have been missed by WES and SNP arrays in many actionable genes such as PIK3CA, EGFR, AKT3, FGFR1, ERBB2, ERBB3 and ESR1. The striking differences between the number of mutational hotspots and CNAs generated from these platforms highlight a number of factors that should be considered in the interpretation of array and NGS-based genomic data for precision medicine.

Several oxaliplatin transporters were previously identified but their relative contributions to determining oxaliplatin tumour responses and gastrointestinal tumour cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin remains unclear. We studied clinical associations between tumour expression of oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes and patient response to oxaliplatin, then experimentally verified associations found with MRP2 in models of human gastrointestinal cancer. Among 18 oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes, MRP2 was the only one to be differentially expressed in the tumours of colorectal cancer patients who did or did not respond to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Over-expression of MRP2 (endogenously in HepG2 and PANC-1 cells, or induced by stable transfection of HEK293 cells) decreased oxaliplatin accumulation and cytotoxicity but those deficits were reversed by inhibition of MRP2 with myricetin or siRNA knockdown. Mice bearing subcutaneous HepG2 tumour xenografts were sensitised to oxaliplatin antitumour activity by concurrent myricetin treatment with little or no increase in toxicity. In conclusion, MRP2 limits oxaliplatin accumulation and response in human gastrointestinal cancer.

We compare optimized gene signatures for cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin responses in the same cell lines and validate each signature using data from patients with cancer. Supervised support vector machine learning is used to derive gene sets whose expression is related to the cell line GI50 values by backwards feature selection with cross-validation. Specific genes and functional pathways distinguishing sensitive from resistant cell lines are identified by contrasting signatures obtained at extreme and median GI50 thresholds. Ensembles of gene signatures at different thresholds are combined to reduce the dependence on specific GI50 values for predicting drug responses. The most accurate gene signatures for each platin are: cisplatin: BARD1, BCL2, BCL2L1, CDKN2C, FAAP24, FEN1, MAP3K1, MAPK13, MAPK3, NFKB1, NFKB2, SLC22A5, SLC31A2, TLR4, and TWIST1; carboplatin: AKT1, EIF3K, ERCC1, GNGT1, GSR, MTHFR, NEDD4L, NLRP1, NRAS, RAF1, SGK1, TIGD1, TP53, VEGFB, and VEGFC; and oxaliplatin: BRAF, FCGR2A, IGF1, MSH2, NAGK, NFE2L2, NQO1, PANK3, SLC47A1, SLCO1B1, and UGT1A1. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with bladder, ovarian, and colorectal cancer were used to test the cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin signatures, resulting in 71.0%, 60.2%, and 54.5% accuracies in predicting disease recurrence and 59%, 61%, and 72% accuracies in predicting remission, respectively. One cisplatin signature predicted 100% of recurrence in non-smoking patients with bladder cancer (57% disease-free; N = 19), and 79% recurrence in smokers (62% disease-free; N = 35).

MTH1 dephosphorylates oxidized nucleotides, thereby preventing their incorporation into DNA and protecting tumour cells from oxidative DNA damage. Inhibitors of MTH1 (TH588 and (S)-crizotinib) were shown to reduce cancer cell viability. However, the MTH1-dependency of the anti-cancer effects of these drugs has recently been questioned. Here, we have assessed anti-tumour effects of TH588 and (S)-crizotinib in patient-derived 3D colorectal cancer cultures. Hypoxia and reoxygenation – conditions that increase intracellular ROS levels – increased sensitivity to (S)-crizotinib, but not to TH588. (S)-crizotinib reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-MET and ErbB3 whereas TH588 induced a mitotic cell cycle arrest, which was not affected by adding ROS-modulating compounds. Furthermore, we show that both compounds induced DNA damage that could not be prevented by adding the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Moreover, adding ROS-modulating compounds did not alter the reduction in viability in response to TH588 and (S)-crizotinib. We conclude that TH588 and (S)-crizotinib have very clear and distinct anti-tumour effects in 3D colorectal cancer cultures, but that these effects most likely occur through distinct and ROS-independent mechanisms. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Iron deposits are a phenotypic trait of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Histological iron imaging and contrast-agent free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect these deposits, but their presence in human cancer, and correlation with immunotherapeutic response is largely untested. Here, primarily using these iron imaging approaches, we evaluated the spatial distribution of polarized macrophage populations containing high endogenous levels of iron in preclinical murine models and human breast cancer, and used them as metabolic biomarkers to correlate TAM infiltration with response to immunotherapy in preclinical trials. Macrophage-targeted inhibition of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) by immunotherapy was confirmed to inhibit macrophage accumulation and slow mammary tumor growth in mouse models while also reducing hemosiderin iron-laden TAM accumulation as measured by both iron histology and in vivo iron MRI (FeMRI). Spatial profiling of TAM iron deposit infiltration defined regions of maximal accumulation and response to the CSF1R inhibitor, and revealed differences between microenvironments of human cancer according to levels of polarized macrophage iron accumulation in stromal margins. We therefore demonstrate that iron deposition serves as an endogenous metabolic imaging biomarker of TAM infiltration in breast cancer that has high translational potential for evaluation of immunotherapeutic response. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

The AP2 family also acts as a tumor suppressor. Here we found that p73 and AP2 are able to activate NEU4, a neuraminidase gene, which removes the terminal sialic acid residues from cancer-associated glycans. Under serum starvation, NEU4 was up-regulated and one of the NEU4 target glycans, sialyl Lewis X, was decreased, whereas p73 and AP2 were up-regulated. Sialyl Lewis X levels were not, however, decreased under starvation conditions in p73- or AP2-knockdown cells. p53 and AP2 underwent protein-protein interactions, exerting synergistic effects to activate p21, and interaction of p53 with AP2 was lost in cells expressing the L350P mutation of p53. The homologous residues in p63 and p73 are L423 and L377, respectively. The synergistic effect of p53/p63 with AP2 to activate genes was lost with the L350P/L423P mutation in p53/p63, but p73 bearing the L377P mutation was able to interact with AP2 and exerted its normal synergistic effects. We propose that p73 and AP2 synergistically activate the NEU4 promoter in colon cancer cells. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Nanoparticles prepared by single emulsion method had a size of less than 300 nm with 70.7 ± 3.9% reaction yield and 26.4 ± 1.1% Hsp loading capacity. Treatment of C6 glioma cells with HspNPs for 24 and 48 h resulted in dose- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability, with approximate IC50 of 28 and 21 μg/mL, respectively (p = .036 for 24 h, p = .025 for 48 h). The percentage of PCNA positive cells decreased to 20% and 10%, respectively, for Hsp- and HspNP-treated cells at concentration of 100 µg/mL. Treatment with increasing concentrations of HspNPs (25, 50, 75 and 100 µg/mL) resulted in 9.1-, 7-, 12.5- and 12.7-fold in increase in apoptotic cell number. Optimum doses of Hsp and HspNPs were found to increase oxidative damage in C6 glioma cells. MDA levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were found to be significantly elevated at 75 and 100 µg/mL exposure concentration of HspNPs with (p = .002) and (p = .018), respectively for 48-h treatment. The results obtained with this study showed biocompatible polymeric nanoparticle systems has great advantages to enhance anti-cancer activity and poor solubility of therapeutic agents.

GO exhibits pH-dependent fluorescence emission in the visible/near-infrared, providing a possibility of molecular imaging and pH-sensing. It is also water soluble and has a substantial platform for functionalization, allowing for the delivery of multiple therapeutics. GO physical properties are modified to enhance cellular internalization, producing fluorescent nanoflakes with low (<15%) cytotoxicity at the imaging concentrations of 15 μg/mL. As a result, at lower flake sizes GO rapidly internalizes into HeLa cells with the following 70% fluorescence based clearance at 24 h, assessed by its characteristic emission in red/near-IR. pH-dependence of GO emission is utilized to provide the sensing of acidic extracellular environments of cancer cells. The results demonstrate diminishing green/red (550/630 nm) fluorescence intensity ratios for HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells in comparison to HEK-293 healthy cells suggesting a potential use of GO as a non-invasive optical sensor for cancer microenvironments.

Patients with primary cervical cancer and newly diagnosed were selected from ten different cancer specialist hospitals of Malaysia. Patients’ demographic and clinical data were obtained for the prognostic analysis. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate patients’ survival time (CSS and OS) with DM status and values were compared using the log-rank test. A total of 19,785 newly diagnosed CC patients were registered during 2010–2016, among them only 16,946 (85.6%) with primary CC tumor. There was no difference in treatment modality between DM and non-DM patients. However intergroup assessment showed that type 2DM have significantly higher rate of mortality in both overall mortality (28.3%) and CC-specific (11.7%) as compared to Type 1DM (17.3%; 5.5%) and non DM patients (12.7%; 9.1%) (p < 0.001). Within group assessments showed that Type 2DM patients have better quality of life (mean 7.13 ± 3.67) (p < 0.001) and less distress levels (mean 2.41 ± 0.63) (p < 0.011) as compared to type1 DM (meant 10.54 ± 2.11; 3.19 ± 1.07).

In order to tackle cancer heterogeneity and comply with the data dimensionality, a number of network and pathway approaches were invented but rarely systematically applied to this task. We propose a new method, called NEAmarker, for finding sensitive and robust biomarkers at the pathway level. scores from network enrichment analysis transform the original space of altered genes into a lower-dimensional space of pathways. These dimensions are then correlated with phenotype variables. The method was first tested using in vitro data from three anti-cancer drug screens and then on clinical data of The Cancer Genome Atlas. It proved superior to the single-gene and alternative enrichment analyses in terms of (1) universal applicability to different data types with a possibility of cross-platform integration, (2) consistency of the discovered correlates between independent drug screens, and (3) ability to explain differential survival of treated patients. Our new screen of anti-cancer compounds validated the performance of multivariate models of drug sensitivity. The previously proposed methods of enrichment analysis could achieve comparable levels of performance in certain tests. However, only our method could discover predictors of both in vitro response and patient survival given administration of the same drug. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

SPIONs entrapped in the core of the nanocomplex may act as a hyperthermia agent and generate localized heat upon excitation with an alternating magnetic field (AMF), thus enabling a thermo-chemotherapy strategy for cancer treatment. Accordingly, the cytotoxic effect and the mode of cell death triggered by the nanocomplex in combination with AMF were evaluated on two different cancer cell lines with various folate receptor (FR) expression levels, including KB nasopharyngeal cancer cells overexpressing FRs as the model and MCF-7 breast cancer cells with low level of FRs as the blank sample. The obtained results showed that KB cell death was greater than the cell death observed in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, a majority of cell death in both cell lines were related to apoptosis when the folate-modified nanocomplex was used instated of the non-folate-modified nanocomplex. Therefore, functionalizing the nanocomplex with folate modulated the response to thermo-chemotherapy by shifting the cell death pathways toward apoptosis." ;

This cohort study included 128 HER2-positive breast cancer who received NAC with trastuzumab. TILs grading of the tumor stroma in pretreatment biopsy specimens and residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab was categorized as low, intermediate, and high based on the criteria of the International Working Group. In current study, the pCR rate was 64.8%, and the Relapse-free survival (RFS) was significantly worse in the non-pCR group than in the pCR group. The pCR rate correlated with the TILs grade in pretreatment tumors. In 45 non-pCR patients, TILs grade was higher in the residual tumors than in the pretreatment tumors. The RFS was significantly better in residual tumors with high TILs grade than those with low TILs grade (p = 0.033). In conclusion, assessment of the TILs grade in residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab might be necessary to determine patients with good prognosis among those who do not achieve pCR. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Most targeting strategies of anticancer drug delivery systems (DDSs) rely on the surface functionalization of nanocarriers with specific ligands, which trigger the internalization in cancer cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The endocytosis implies the entrapment of DDSs in acidic vesicles (endosomes and lysosomes) and their eventual ejection by exocytosis. This process, intrinsic to eukaryotic cells, is one of the main drawbacks of DDSs because it reduces the drug bioavailability in the intracellular environment. The escape of DDSs from the acidic vesicles is, therefore, crucial to enhance the therapeutic performance at low drug dose. To this end, we developed a multifunctionalized DDS that combines high specificity towards cancer cells with endosomal escape capabilities. Doxorubicin-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles were functionalized with polyethylenimine, a polymer commonly used to induce endosomal rupture, and hyaluronic acid, which binds to CD44 receptors, overexpressed in cancer cells. We show irrefutable proof that the developed DDS can escape the endosomal pathway upon polymeric functionalization. Interestingly, the combination of the two polymers resulted in higher endosomal escape efficiency than the polyethylenimine coating alone. Hyaluronic acid additionally provides the system with cancer targeting capability and enzymatically controlled drug release. Thanks to this multifunctionality, the engineered DDS had cytotoxicity comparable to the pure drug whilst displaying high specificity towards cancer cells. The polymeric engineering here developed enhances the performance of DDS at low drug dose, holding great potential for anticancer therapeutic applications. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The use of oncolytic viruses (OVs) for cancer treatment is emerging as a successful strategy that combines the direct, targeted killing of the cancer with the induction of a long-lasting anti-tumor immune response. Using multiple aggressive murine models of triple-negative breast cancer, we have recently demonstrated that the early administration of oncolytic Maraba virus (MRB) prior to surgical resection of the primary tumor is sufficient to minimize the metastatic burden, protect against tumor rechallenge, cure a fraction of the mice and sensitize refractory tumors to immune checkpoint blockade without the need for further treatment. Here, we apply our surgical model to other OVs: Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Adenovirus (Ad), Reovirus (Reo) and Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and show that all of the tested OVs could positively change the outcome of the treated animals. The growth of the primary and secondary tumors was differently affected by the various OVs and most of the viruses conferred survival benefits in this neoadjuvant setting despite the absence of direct treatment following rechallenge. This study establishes that OV-therapy confers long-term protection when administered in the pre-operative window of opportunity. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase is overexpressed in approximately 15–20% of breast tumors and associated with aggressive disease and poor clinical outcome. p130Cas represents a nodal scaffold protein regulating cell survival, migration and proliferation in normal and pathological contexts. p130Cas overexpression in ErbB2 human breast cancer correlates with poor prognosis and metastasis formation. Recent data indicate that p130Cas association to ErbB2 protects ErbB2 from degradation, thus enhancing tumorigenesis. Therefore, inhibiting p130Cas/ErbB2 interaction might represent a new therapeutic strategy to target breast cancer. Here we demonstrate by performing Molecular Modeling, Molecular Dynamics, dot blot, ELISA and fluorescence quenching experiments, that p130Cas binds directly to ErbB2. Then, by structure-based virtual screening, we identified two potential inhibitors of p130Cas/ErbB2 interaction. Their experimental validation was performed in vitro and in ErbB2-positive breast cancer cellular models. The results highlight that both compounds interfere with p130Cas/ErbB2 binding and significantly affect cell proliferation and sensitivity to Trastuzumab. Overall, this study identifies p130Cas/ErbB2 complex as a potential breast cancer target revealing new therapeutic perspectives for protein-protein interaction (PPI). © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Gastric cancer (GC) ranks as the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, and approximately 42% of all cases diagnosed each year worldwide are diagnosed in China. A large number of clinical applications have revealed that Trametes robiniophila Μurr. (Huaier) exhibits an anti-tumour effect. However, loss of the bioactive components of Huaier during the extraction procedure with water is unavoidable, and the underlying mechanism of the anti-cancer effect of Huaier remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer effect of Huaier n-butanol extract, which contained 51.4% total flavonoids, on HGC27, MGC803, and AGS human GC cell lines in vitro. At a low concentration, Huaier n-butanol extract inhibited the growth of these GC cell types, induced cell cycle arrest and reduced cell metastasis. Moreover, Huaier n-butanol extract suppressed the c-Myc-Bmi1 signalling pathway, and overexpression of Bmi1 reversed the effects of Huaier n-butanol extract on GC cells. Thus, our findings indicate that Huaier n-butanol extract suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of GC cells via a c-Myc-Bmi1-mediated approach, providing a new perspective for our understanding of the anti-tumour effects of Huaier. These results suggest that Huaier n-butanol extract could be an attractive therapeutic adjuvant for the treatment of human GC. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

In the present study, we screened the anticancer potential of supernatant metabolites from eight native haloarchaeal strains obtained from a culture collection in Iran. Five human cancer cell lines including breast, lung, prostate and also human fibroblast cells as the normal control were used in the present study. Moreover, to evaluate the anti-tumor effect of the selected supernatant, inhibition of sphere formation and tumor development was assessed in-vitro and in-vivo, respectively. Among all strains, supernatant metabolites from Halobacterium salinarum IBRC M10715 had the most potent cytotoxic effect on prostate cancer cell lines (IC50 = 0.5 mg/mL) without any effects on normal cells. It significantly increased both early and late apoptosis (about 11% and 9%, respectively) in the androgen-dependent PC3 cell line, reduced sphere formation ability of DU145 and PC3 cells with down-regulation of SOX2 gene expression. Furthermore, our results revealed that tumors developed in nude mice significantly shrank post intratumor injection of metabolites of the haloarchaeal strain. In conclusion, we suggested here for the first time that supernatant metabolites from Halobacterium salinarum IBRC M10715 could be a novel component against prostate cancer in-vitro and in-vivo with remarkable reduction in stem-like properties of tumor. © 2017, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

The main HNSCC risk factors are tobacco, excessive alcohol use, and the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV positive (+) cancers are etiologically different from other HNSCC and often show better prognosis. The current knowledge regarding HNSCC miRNA profiles is still incomplete especially in the context of HPV+ cancer. Thus, we analyzed 61 freshly collected primary oral (OSCC) and oropharyngeal (OPSCC) SCC samples. HPV DNA and RNA was found in 21% cases. The Illumina whole-genome small-RNA profiling by next-generation sequencing was done on 22 samples and revealed 7 specific miRNAs to HPV+ OSCC, 77 to HPV+ OPSCC, and additional 3 shared with both; 51 miRNAs were specific to HPV− OPSCC, 62 to HPV− OSCC, and 31 shared with both. The results for 9 miRNAs (miR-9, -21, -29a, -100, -106b, -143 and -145) were assessed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction on the whole study population. The data was additionally confirmed by reanalyzing publicly available miRNA sequencing Cancer Genome Atlas consortium (TCGA) HNSCC data. Cell signaling pathway analysis revealed differences between HPV+ and HPV− HNSCC. Our findings compared with literature data revealed extensive heterogeneity of miRNA deregulation with only several miRNAs consistently affected, and miR-9 being the most likely HPV related miRNA. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Development of combined therapies constitutes an effective strategy to inhibit cancer cells and prevent the emergence of drug resistance. For this purpose, we investigated the anti-tumoral effect of thirteen phenolic compounds, from the Tunisian quince Cydonia oblonga Miller, alone or combined to 5-FU, on the human 5-FU-resistant LS174-R colon cancer cells in comparison to parental cells. Our results showed that only Kaempferol was able to chemo-sensitize 5-FU-resistant LS174-R cells. This phenolic compound combined with 5-FU exerted synergistic inhibitory effect on cell viability. This combination enhanced the apoptosis and induced cell cycle arrest of both chemo-resistant and sensitive cells through impacting the expression levels of different cellular effectors. Kaempferol also blocked the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and modulated the expression of JAK/STAT3, MAPK, PI3K/AKT and NF-κB. In silico docking analysis suggested that the potent anti-tumoral effect of Kaempferol, compared to its two analogs (Kaempferol 3-O-glucoside and Kampferol 3-O-rutinoside), can be explained by the absence of glucosyl groups. Overall, our data propose Kaempferol as a potential chemotherapeutic agent to be used alone or in combination with 5-FU to overcome colon cancer drug resistance. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Considering the high prevalence and mortality rate of colorectal cancer, in this study we tried to design and validate a standard printed form and evaluate oncologists’ and nurses’ adherence to this form. This cross-sectional study was performed in Omid hospital, Mashhad, Iran from January 2015 to October 2015. A Chemotherapy form including various demographic and clinical parameters and approved chemotherapy regimens for colorectal cancer was designed by the clinical pharmacist and validated by clinical oncologists working in this center. All eligible patients admitted in this center during this period of time were included in the study. Adherence of the oncologists and nurses to this form and probable medication errors were identified by the pharmacy student. Sixty-seven patients with colorectal cancer and a total of 251 chemotherapy courses were evaluated. All patients received regimens compatible with developed form but in 206 courses (98.56%) of chemotherapy dosing error happened and in most of cases patients received lower than calculated dose (37.8%). Three errors occurred in administration step by nurses which they infused the medication in shorter than recommended duration. In general, oncologists’ adherence with developed form for chemotherapy of colorectal cancer was relatively high, except in dose calculation. Avoiding from rounding the calculated medications’ doses and precise calculation of patients’ body surface area can prevent most of medication errors and reduce risk of adverse drug reaction occurrence. © 2017, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

Nevertheless, the importance of transfusion timing is still unclear. The primary purpose of this study is to appraise whether the receipt of intraoperative blood transfusion (BT) differ from postoperative BT in regards to cancer outcomes in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients treated with nephrectomy. Data on 1168 patients with RCC, who underwent radical or partial nephrectomy as primary therapy between 1988–2013 were analyzed. PBT was defined as transfusion of allogeneic red blood cells (RBC) during surgery or the postsurgical period. Survival was analyzed and compared using the Kaplan–Meier method with the log-rank test. Of 1168 patients, 198 patients (16.9%) received a PBT. Including 117 intraoperative BT and 81 postoperative BT. Only 21 (10.6%) patients required both intraoperative and postoperative BT. On multivariate analyses, receipt of PBT was associated with significantly worse local disease recurrence (HR: 2.4; P = 0.017), metastatic progression (HR: 2.7; P = 0.005), cancer-specific mortality (HR: 3.5; P = 0.002) and all-cause mortality (HR: 2.1; P = 0.005). Nevertheless, postoperative BT was not independently associated with increased risk of local recurrence (p = 0.1), metastatic progression (P = 0.16) or kidney cancer death (P = 0.63), yet did significantly increase the risk of overall mortality (HR: 2.6; P = 0.004).

For this reason novel therapies accounting for PDAC peculiarities, such as the relevant stromal reaction, are urgently needed. Here adipose mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (AD-MSC) have been armed to constantly release a soluble trimeric and multimeric variant of the known anti-cancer TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (sTRAIL). This cancer gene therapy strategy was in vitro challenged demonstrating that sTRAIL was thermally stable and able to induce apoptosis in the PDAC lines BxPC-3, MIA PaCa-2 and against primary PDAC cells. sTRAIL released by AD-MSC relocated into the tumor stroma was able to significantly counteract tumor growth in vivo with a significant reduction in tumor size, in cytokeratin-7+ cells and by an anti-angiogenic effect. In parallel, histology on PDAC specimens form patients (n = 19) was performed to investigate the levels of TRAIL DR4, DR5 and OPG receptors generating promising insights on the possible clinical translation of our approach. These results indicate that adipose MSC can very efficiently vehicle a novel TRAIL variant opening unexplored opportunities for PDAC treatment. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Malignant melanoma is one of the untreatable cancers in which conventional therapeutic strategies, including chemotherapy, are hardly effective. Therefore, identification of novel therapeutic targets involved in melanoma progression is urgently needed for developing effective therapeutic methods. Overexpression of interleukin-13 receptor α2 (IL13Rα2) is observed in several cancer types including glioma and pancreatic cancer. Although IL13Rα2 is implicated in the progression of various types of cancer, its expression and roles in the malignant melanoma have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we showed that IL13Rα2 was expressed in approximately 7.5% melanoma patients. While IL13Rα2 expression in human melanoma cells decreased their proliferation in vitro, it promoted in vivo tumour growth and angiogenesis in melanoma xenograft mouse model. We also found that the expression of amphiregulin, a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, was correlated with IL13Rα2 expression in cultured melanoma cells, xenograft tumour tissues and melanoma clinical samples. Furthermore, expression of amphiregulin promoted tumour growth, implicating causal relationship between the expression of IL13Rα2 and amphiregulin. These results suggest that IL13Rα2 enhances tumorigenicity by inducing angiogenesis in malignant melanoma, and serves as a potential therapeutic target of malignant melanoma. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

However, its prognostic value and the underlying mechanism in lung cancer remains unclear. Herein we evaluated the expression of PKD2 in lung adenocarcinoma and investigated its relationship with EMT. GSEA, TCGA and K-M plotter database were applied and revealed that high PKD2 expression predicted poor outcome and related with lymph nodes metastasis in lung cancer. IHC and qRT-PCR were performed and found PKD2 was elevated in lung adenocarcinoma and negatively related with OS (p = 0.015), PFS (p = 0.006) and the level of E-cadherin (p = 0.021). Experiment in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines demonstrated up-regulation of PKD2 led to high expression of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vim, mmp9 et al.) and EMT transcription factors(zeb1, twist, snail), and the results were reversed when PKD2 was knocked down. Further investigation showed that abrogation of PKD2 inhibited A549 cell migration, invasion, proliferation and induced cell arrest in G2/M phase. We concluded that high expression of PKD2 was associated with poor prognosis and cancer progression in lung adenocarcinoma patients by promoting EMT. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

We showed for the first time that Raman imaging can be used to distinguish successfully between glycosylated and nonglycosylated proteins in normal and cancer tissue. Thousands of protein, lipid and glycan species exist in cells and tissues and their metabolism is monitored via numerous pathways, networks and methods. The metabolism can change in response to cellular environment alterations, such as development of a disease. Measuring such alterations and understanding the pathways involved are crucial to fully understand cellular metabolism in cancer development. In this paper Raman markers of glycogen, glycosaminoglycan, chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate proteoglycan were identified based on their vibrational signatures. High spatial resolution of Raman imaging combined with chemometrics allows separation of individual species from many chemical components present in each cell. We have found that metabolism of proteins, lipids and glycans is markedly deregulated in breast (adenocarcinoma) and brain (medulloblastoma) tumors. We have identified two glycoforms in the normal breast tissue and the malignant brain tissue in contrast to the breast cancer tissue where only one glycoform has been identified. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Very recently, we postulated that the incorporation of citral into nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC-Citral) improves solubility and delivery of the citral without toxic effects in vivo. Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate anti-cancer effects of NLC-Citral in MDA MB-231 cells in vitro through the Annexin V, cell cycle, JC-1 and fluorometric assays. Additionally, this study is aimed to effects of NLC-Citral in reducing the tumor weight and size in 4T1 induced murine breast cancer model. Results showed that NLC-Citral induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest in MDA MB-231 cells. Furthermore, a prominent anti-metastatic ability of NLC-Citral was demonstrated in vitro using scratch, migration and invasion assays. A significant reduction of migrated and invaded cells was observed in the NLC-Citral treated MDA MB-231 cells. To further evaluate the apoptotic and anti-metastatic mechanism of NLC-Citral at the molecular level, microarray-based gene expression and proteomic profiling were conducted. Based on the result obtained, NLC-Citral was found to regulate several important signaling pathways related to cancer development such as apoptosis, cell cycle, and metastasis signaling pathways. Additionally, gene expression analysis was validated through the targeted RNA sequencing and real-time polymerase chain reaction. In conclusion, the NLC-Citral inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells in vitro, majorly through the induction of apoptosis, anti-metastasis, anti-angiogenesis potentials, and reducing the tumor weight and size without altering the therapeutic effects of citral. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The incidence of developing cancer should increase with the body mass, yet is not the case, a conundrum referred to as Peto’s paradox. Elephants have a lower incidence of cancer suggesting that these animals have probably evolved different ways to protect themselves against the disease. The paradox is worth revisiting with the realization that most mammals encode an endogenous APOBEC3 cytidine deaminase capable of mutating single stranded DNA. Indeed, the mutagenic activity of some APOBEC3 enzymes has been shown to introduce somatic mutations into genomic DNA. These enzymes are now recognized as causal agent responsible for the accumulation of CG- > TA transitions and DNA breaks leading to chromosomal rearrangements in human cancer genomes. Here, we identified an elephant A3Z1 gene, related to human APOBEC3A and showed that it could efficiently deaminate cytidine, 5-methylcytidine and produce DNA breaks leading to massive apoptosis, similar to other mammalian APOBEC3A enzymes where body mass varies by up to four orders of magnitude. Consequently, it could be considered that eAZ1 might contribute to cancer in elephants in a manner similar to their proposed role in humans. If so, eAZ1 might be particularly well regulated to counter Peto’s paradox. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

The cells and mitochondria were isolated from cancerous and non-cancerous ovarian tissues and exposed to IC 50 concentration of F1 fraction for evaluation of mitochondrial and cellular parameters. Our results showed that F1 fraction of T. coronatus crude extract significantly induced toxic effects only in the cancerous ovarian mitochondria, including increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, mitochondrial swelling, and cytochrome c release.Flow-cytometry analysis demonstrated that F1 fraction of T. coronatus progressively induced apoptosis and necrosis only on EOC but not non-cancerous cells.

Biotin-PEG-PCL polymers have been used for targeted drug delivery to cancer, as well as to improve the pharmacokinetics of the drug and reduce its effects. In this study, biotin-conjugated copolymers were fabricated with polymerization of the ring opening method and the properties of copolymer and nanoparticles were investigated using various techniques. The toxicity of artemisinin and its nanoparticles have been investigated on MCF-7 and normal HFF2 cells. The results showed that the encapsulation efficacy of artemisinin in nanoparticles was 45.5 ± 0.41%. The release profile of the drug indicates that the release is slow and controlled and is approximately pH dependent. The results of artemisinin cell culture on human breast cancer cells showed that biotin-PEG-PCL nanoparticles had an inhibitory effect on MCF-7 cells and had no toxic effects on HFF2 cells. Anticancer activity in vivo in the 4T1 breast cancer model showed that tumour volumes were decreased up 40 mm3 by ART-loaded micelles and 76 mm3 by free ART, compared to the control group (2150 mm). In vivo results showed that this formulation significantly increases the accumulation of substances in the tumours. Therefore, the molecular formulation of ART-based copolymers can be a desirable process for cancer treatment purposes. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group." ;

Previous reports have shown the effectiveness of BP in treating cancer diseases. However, BP has no targeting capacity towards specific cancer cells. To improve treatment efficiency and reduce the dose of BP used in cancer treatment, targeting-based approaches should be developed. In the present study, we used riboflavin-5′-phosphate (RFMP) immobilized iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4 MNPs) as carriers for BP to treat cancer cell lines derived from liver, prostate and breast. These model cancer cells overexpress riboflavin receptors on their cell membrane and are also sensitive to BP treatment. Thus, BP-binding free RFMP on MNPs can be used as probes to target these model cells, whereas BP can be readily released on target cancer cells. Cell viability was twofold lower by using Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs immobilized with BP than that achieved by using free-form BP at a similar amount. Moreover, BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs have no apparent harmful effects on non-target cells. In addition, we evaluated the level of cysteine-aspartic acid protease 3 (caspase 3) in the resultant cell lysate obtained after treatment by BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs to demonstrate that apoptosis is mainly involved in the growth inhibition of target cells. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Patients with laryngeal cancer (ICD-10: C32) between 2009 and 2010 were retrospectively identified and tracked until 2015 using the Korean Health Insurance claims database. During the seven-year follow-up period, 5,322 subjects were newly diagnosed with larynx cancer. The mean age of people with laryngeal cancer was much higher than those without (63.29 vs. 47.7 years, p < 0.0001), and the incidence of larynx cancer in men was much higher than that in women (93.16% vs. 6.84%, p < 0.0001). Age, gender, smoking status, alcohol intake, and exercise-adjusted hazard ratios indicated that participants with MetS had a 1.13-fold higher hazard of having larynx cancer than those without MetS. The number of MetS components was a strong risk factor for laryngeal cancer with a higher risk estimate of this cancer in both ex- and current smokers as well as people who have never smoked. MetS was found to be an independent risk factor for the incidence of laryngeal cancer.

        fabio:abstract    "Chromosome changes are one of the hallmarks of human malignancies. Chromosomal rearrangement is frequent in human cancers. One of the consequences of chromosomal rearrangement is gene fusions in the cancer genome. We have previously identified a panel of fusion genes in aggressive prostate cancers. In this study, we showed that 6 of these fusion genes are present in 7 different types of human malignancies with variable frequencies. Among them, the CCNH-C5orf30 and TRMT11-GRIK2 gene fusions were found in breast cancer, colon cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, ovarian cancer and liver cancer, with frequencies ranging from 12.9% to 85%. In contrast, four other gene fusions (mTOR-TP53BP1, TMEM135-CCDC67, KDM4-AC011523.2 and LRRC59-FLJ60017) are less frequent. Both TRMT11-GRIK2 and CCNH-C5orf30 are also frequently present in lymph node metastatic cancer samples from the breast, colon and ovary. Thus, detecting these fusion transcripts may have significant biological and clinical implications in cancer patient management. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Quantifying the genetic correlation between cancers can provide important insights into the mechanisms driving cancer etiology. Using genome-wide association study summary statistics across six cancer types based on a total of 296,215 cases and 301,319 controls of European ancestry, here we estimate the pair-wise genetic correlations between breast, colorectal, head/neck, lung, ovary and prostate cancer, and between cancers and 38 other diseases. We observed statistically significant genetic correlations between lung and head/neck cancer (r g = 0.57, p = 4.6 × 10 −8 ), breast and ovarian cancer (r g = 0.24, p = 7 × 10 −5 ), breast and lung cancer (r g = 0.18, p =1.5 × 10 −6 ) and breast and colorectal cancer (r g = 0.15, p = 1.1 × 10 −4 ). We also found that multiple cancers are genetically correlated with non-cancer traits including smoking, psychiatric diseases and metabolic characteristics.

        fabio:abstract    "Purpose: Several previous studies have shown that oral bisphosphonates (BPs) are associated with the incidence of 13 specific cancers, including lung cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the findings are heterogeneous. Methods and results: Relevant studies published in databases such as PubMed, Embase database, and Cochrane library were systematically retrieved from inception to August 25th, 2018, regardless of language, by two investigators independently. Afterwards, the maximum adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted from the retrieved studies. Finally, 13 cohort studies involving 1,510,763 participants were enrolled into this meta-analysis. No significant relationship was found between oral BPs and the risk of all-cause cancer in osteoporosis (OP) patients among the entire population (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80–1.18; I 2 92.5%). Besides, oral BPs could remarkably reduce the incidence of breast cancer (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68–0.92; I 2 54%) and endometrial cancer (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64–0.96; I 2 0%) in postmenopausal OP females. In addition, oral BPs were also found to evidently reduce the incidence of upper gastrointestinal cancer in OP patients among the entire population (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54–0.98; I 2 36.1%). However, oral BPs may lead to increased risk of liver cancer in mixed genders (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.03–2.77; I 2 30.7%). Conclusions: Taken together, oral BPs do not increase the risk of incidence of all-cause cancer; instead, they can reduce the incidence of breast, endometrial, and upper gastrointestinal cancers among the postmenopausal OP females. Our analysis stratified by gender suggests that oral BPs may increase the incidence of liver cancer in mixed genders, while no significant association was observed in females. Careful analysis of post-marketing data should be conducted to address the clinical relevance of our results on the putative association of oral BP use and liver cancer suggested by our meta-analysis. © 2018, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation." ;

However, it remains unclear how cancer cells migrate in the three-dimensional (3D) matrix of cancer tissues and how CAFs support the cancer invasion. Here we propose a novel mechanism of fibroblast-dependent cancer cell invasion in the 3D collagen matrix. Human cancer cell lines from the pancreas (Panc-1), lung (A549) and some other organs actively adhered to normal fibroblasts and primary lung CAFs in cultures. To show its significance in tumor invasion, we designed a new invasion assay in which homogeneous microspheroids consisting of cancer cells and fibroblasts were embedded into collagen gel. Time-lapse experiments showed that cancer cells adhered to and quickly migrated on the long protrusions of fibroblasts in the 3D collagen matrix. Fibroblast-free cancer cells poorly invaded the matrix. Experiments with function-blocking antibodies, siRNAs, and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that cancer cells adhered to fibroblasts through integrin α5β1-mediated binding to fibronectin on the surface of fibroblasts. Immunochemical analyses of the co-cultures and lung cancers suggested that cancer cells could acquire the migratory force by the fibronectin/integrin signaling. Our results also revealed that the fibroblast-bound fibronectin was a preferential substrate for cancer cells to migrate in the collagen matrix. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

However, very few studies investigated the role of integrin α3 (ITGα3) in malignant cancers. Here, we determined the functional role of ITGα3 in pancreatic cancer. Analysis of public microarray databases and Western blot analysis indicated a unique expression of ITGα3 in human pancreatic cancer. Silencing ITGα3 expression significantly inhibited the viability and migration of human pancreatic cancer cells. Notably, ablation of ITGα3 expression resulted in a significant decrease of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression compared with transfection of control-siRNA through an increased number of leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domain protein 1 (LRIG1) expression. In addition, ablating ITGα3 inhibited tumour growth via blockade of EGFR signalling in vivo. Furthermore, the highly expressed ITGα3 led to a poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. Our results provide novel insights into ITGα3-induced aggressive pancreatic cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Since epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in promoting metastasis of cancer, many mechanisms regarding EMT have been studied. We previously showed that Ribonucleic acid export 1 (RAE1) is dysregulated in breast cancer and its overexpression leads to aggressive breast cancer phenotypes by inducing EMT. Here, we evaluated the functional capacity of RAE1 in breast cancer metastasis by using a three-dimensional (3D) culture system and xenograft models. Furthermore, to investigate the mechanisms of RAE1-driven EMT, in vitro studies were carried out. The induction of EMT with RAE1-overexpression was confirmed under the 3D culture system and in vivo system. Importantly, RAE1 mediates upregulation of an EMT marker ZEB1, by binding to the promoter region of ZEB1. Knockdown of ZEB1 in RAE1-overexpressing cells suppressed invasive and migratory behaviors, accompanied by an increase in epithelial and a decrease in mesenchymal markers. Taken together, these data demonstrate that RAE1 contributes to breast cancer metastasis by regulating a key EMT-inducing factor ZEB1 expression, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Obesity is a risk factor for many cancers including breast, esophageal, colon, and thyroid cancer. We aimed to evaluate the association of thyroid cancer with body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and weight change. This nationwide population-based cohort study included 11,323,006 adults who joined the national health screening program. Weight change was defined as the difference between the weight of the subjects measured during the study period and the weight at the time of four years ago. For evaluating the association between the weight change and the risk of thyroid cancer, subjects without weight change for four years were defined as the reference group. Mean age was 50.1 ± 13.7 years and 44% were female. In total, 50,464 subjects (0.4%) had newly-diagnosed thyroid cancer. After multivariable analyses, the incidence of thyroid cancer increased significantly in subjects with larger WC as well as higher BMI (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). In subjects who were lean and became obese, the incidence of thyroid cancers increased significantly (hazard ratio [HR] 1.15 [1.11–1.19]). In subjects who were obese and became lean, the incidence of thyroid cancers decreased significantly (HR 0.89 [0.86–0.93]). These results demonstrated that higher BMI and larger WC were significantly associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer. Weight gain in lean subjects was associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer, and weight reduction in subjects with obesity was associated with a decreased risk of thyroid cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

In order to understand this increase, country specific dietary exposures have been investigated. The aim of this study was to quantify the association between consumption of brown cheese, a common bread topping in Norway, and colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer in the prospective Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) Study. Data on brown cheese consumption and adjustment factors was available for 82 527 women. During a mean of 14.6 years of follow-up (1.2 million person-years), there were 1360 cases of colorectal cancer (907 colon; 453 rectal). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer sites. We modelled restricted cubic splines with 4 knots, to assess a possible non-linear relationship between brown cheese intake and the investigated cancer sites. In the age-adjusted model, consumption of more than 2 slices (>16 grams) of brown cheese per day was associated with 13% reduced risk of colon cancer (95% CI 4%-21%) compared to women who did not consume brown cheese. The multivariable-adjusted model, however, showed no association between brown cheese consumption and the risk of colorectal, colon, or rectal cancer (colorectal: HR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.76–1.13, p-trend 0.37; colon: HR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.65–1.06; p-trend = 0.10; rectal: HR = 1.16, 95% CI 0.84–1.1.61, p-trend = 0.41). In this large, prospective cohort study of women, consumption of brown cheese was suggestively protective against colon cancer. However, adjustment attenuated the inverse risk association. Brown cheese consumption was not associated with rectal cancer, or colorectal cancer overall. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Current cancer diagnosis utilizes histopathology, which requires tissue acquisition, extensive processing and, in most cases, relies on the qualitative morphological analysis of tissues and cells. Molecular biomarkers are only available for a few specific tumor subtypes. We discovered that the fluorescence polarization (Fpol) of Methylene Blue (MB) is significantly higher in cancer than in normal human breast tissues and cells. We confirmed that fluorescence polarization imaging did not affect the viability of the cells and yielded highly significant differences between cancer and normal cells using MB concentrations as low as 0.05 and 0.01 mg/ml. To explain this phenomenon we examined intracellular localization of MB and its fluorescence lifetime. We determined that higher fluorescence polarization of MB occurs due to its increased accumulation in mitochondria of cancer cells, as well as shorter fluorescence lifetime in cancer relative to normal cells. As quantitative MB Fpol imaging can be performed in vivo and in real time, it holds the potential to provide an accurate quantitative marker of cancer at the cellular level. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

The anticancer polymers are designed to target anionic lipids exposed on the cancer cell surfaces and act by disrupting the cancer cell membranes. Because the polymer mechanism is not dependent on cell proliferation, we hypothesized that the polymers were active against dormant cancer cells. The polymers exhibited cytotoxicity to proliferating prostate cancer. Importantly, the polymer killed dormant prostate cancer cells that were resistant to docetaxel. This study demonstrates a new approach to discover novel anticancer therapeutics. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

We developed a novel computational platform applying a multi-modal approach to filter out passengers and more robustly identify putative driver genes. The primary filter identifies enrichment of cancer mutations in CATH functional families (CATH-FunFams) – structurally and functionally coherent sets of evolutionary related domains. Using structural representatives from CATH-FunFams, we subsequently seek enrichment of mutations in 3D and show that these mutation clusters have a very significant tendency to lie close to known functional sites or conserved sites predicted using CATH-FunFams. Our third filter identifies enrichment of putative driver genes in functionally coherent protein network modules confirmed by literature analysis to be cancer associated. Our approach is complementary to other domain enrichment approaches exploiting Pfam families, but benefits from more functionally coherent groupings of domains. Using a set of mutations from 22 cancers we detect 151 putative cancer drivers, of which 79 are not listed in cancer resources and include recently validated cancer associated genes EPHA7, DCC netrin-1 receptor and zinc-finger protein ZNF479. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Cox proportional hazards models were used. Males and females classified as obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg /m −2 ) have a 33% and 22% increased risk of all-cancer, respectively, than their normal weight counterparts. Similar all-cancer risk increases are observed for those above sex-specific WC guidelines.

Collectively, 86.3% (63/73) of HAMPs have recurrent alterations in at least 1 cancer type and 16 HAMPs, including 9 understudied HAMPs, are identified as putative therapeutic targets across multiple cancer types. For example, the recurrent focal amplification of BRD9 is observed in 9 cancer types and genetic depletion of BRD9 inhibits tumor growth.

        fabio:abstract    "The current system for evaluating prostate cancer architecture is the Gleason grading system which divides the morphology of cancer into five distinct architectural patterns, labeled 1 to 5 in increasing levels of cancer aggressiveness, and generates a score by summing the labels of the two most dominant patterns. The Gleason score is currently the most powerful prognostic predictor of patient outcomes; however, it suffers from problems in reproducibility and consistency due to the high intra-observer and inter-observer variability amongst pathologists. In addition, the Gleason system lacks the granularity to address potentially prognostic architectural features beyond Gleason patterns. We evaluate prostate cancer for architectural subtypes using techniques from topological data analysis applied to prostate cancer glandular architecture. In this work we demonstrate the use of persistent homology to capture architectural features independently of Gleason patterns. Specifically, using persistent homology, we compute topological representations of purely graded prostate cancer histopathology images of Gleason patterns 3,4 and 5, and show that persistent homology is capable of clustering prostate cancer histology into architectural groups through a ranked persistence vector. Our results indicate the ability of persistent homology to cluster prostate cancer histopathology images into unique groups with dominant architectural patterns consistent with the continuum of Gleason patterns. In addition, of particular interest, is the sensitivity of persistent homology to identify specific sub-architectural groups within single Gleason patterns, suggesting that persistent homology could represent a robust quantification method for prostate cancer architecture with higher granularity than the existing semi-quantitative measures. The capability of these topological representations to segregate prostate cancer by architecture makes them an ideal candidate for use as inputs to future machine learning approaches with the intent of augmenting traditional approaches with topological features for improved diagnosis and prognosis. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Accumulative studies demonstrate that UHRF1 is broadly overexpressed in cancers, which contributes to cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Interestingly, a proteasome-dependent downregulation of UHRF1 has been observed in pluripotent ground state mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) cultured in the presence of two kinase (MEK1/MEK2 and GSK3β) inhibitors (termed 2i), raising the question whether UHRF1 is similarly regulated in cancer cells. Here we present evidence that while addition of 2i broadly downregulates UHRF1 and DNMT1 in various cancer cells, distinct underlying mechanisms are involved. In contrast to mESCs, 2i-induced downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in cancer cells cannot be rescued by proteasome inhibitor and occurs primarily at the level of transcription. Furthermore, downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 by 2i is due to inhibition of MEK1/MEK2, but not GSK3β activity. Data mining reveals a marked co-expression of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in normal tissues as well as cancers. We provide evidence that multiple transcription factors including E2F1 and SP1 mediate the transcriptional activation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 by the activated MEK/ERK pathway. Together our study reveals distinct regulation of UHRF1/DNMT1 in mESCs and cancer cells and identifies activated MEK/ERK pathway as a driving force for coordinated and aberrant over-expression of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in cancers. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

When it is applied to cancer cells, solid stress hinders their proliferation rate and promotes cancer cell invasion and metastatic potential.

Here, we used two pancreatic cancer cell lines and an established in vitro system to study the effect of solid stress-induced signal transduction on pancreatic cancer cell migration as well as the mechanism involved. Our results show that the migratory ability of cells increases as a direct response to solid stress. We also found that Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) expression and secretion is strongly upregulated in pancreatic cancer cells in response to mechanical compression. Performing a phosphoprotein screening, we identified that solid stress activates the Akt/CREB1 pathway to transcriptionally regulate GDF15 expression, which eventually promotes pancreatic cancer cell migration. Our results suggest a novel solid stress signal transduction mechanism bringing GDF15 to the centre of pancreatic tumor biology and rendering it a potential target for future anti-metastatic therapeutic innovations. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a cancer treatment that make use of the cancer-specific accumulation of porphyrins. We have reported that mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mitROS) upregulate uptake transporter of porphyrins, heme carrier protein-1 (HCP-1). The accumulation of cancer-specific porphyrins was increased by mitROS production, thereby the cancer-specific PDT cytotoxicity was enhanced. Thus we investigated whether mitROS production by hyperthermia can enhanced the cytotoxicity of PDT or not. In this study, 1 h of hyperthermia at 42 °C increased the mitROS production, and both the accumulation of cancer-specific porphyrins and the PDT cytotoxicity increased. Moreover, the authors treated cells with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) to examine the effect of mitROS. NAC inhibited the increasing ROS production after hyperthermia to restrain the post-treatment increase of cancer-specific porphyrins accumulation. Moreover, the increase of ROS production in cancer cells after hyperthermia upregulated HCP-1 expression and downregulated ABCG2 expression. These regulation were inhibited by NAC. These results suggest that hyperthermia treatment increased mitROS production, which involved HpD accumulation and enhanced PDT effects in cancer cells. The mechanism of this phenomenon was most likely to be due to both the upregulation of HCP-1 and the downregulation of ABCG2 by mitROS. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Recent studies showed that changes to the gut microbiome alters the microbiome-derived metabolome, potentially promoting carcinogenesis in organs that are distal to the gut. In this study, we assessed the relationship between breast cancer and cadaverine biosynthesis. Cadaverine treatment of Balb/c female mice (500 nmol/kg p.o. q.d.) grafted with 4T1 breast cancer cells ameliorated the disease (lower mass and infiltration of the primary tumor, fewer metastases, and lower grade tumors). Cadaverine treatment of breast cancer cell lines corresponding to its serum reference range (100–800 nM) reverted endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, inhibited cellular movement and invasion, moreover, rendered cells less stem cell-like through reducing mitochondrial oxidation. Trace amino acid receptors (TAARs), namely, TAAR1, TAAR8 and TAAR9 were instrumental in provoking the cadaverine-evoked effects. Early stage breast cancer patients, versus control women, had reduced abundance of the CadA and LdcC genes in fecal DNA, both responsible for bacterial cadaverine production. Moreover, we found low protein expression of E. coli LdcC in the feces of stage 1 breast cancer patients. In addition, higher expression of lysine decarboxylase resulted in a prolonged survival among early-stage breast cancer patients. Taken together, cadaverine production seems to be a regulator of early breast cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

The specific function of CBX6 in breast cancer is currently undefined. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset led to the identification of CBX6 as a consistently downregulated gene in breast cancer. We provided evidence showing enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) negatively regulated CBX6 expression in a Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)-dependent manner. Exogenous overexpression of CBX6 inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation, and induced cell cycle arrest along with suppression of migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro. Microarray analyses revealed that CBX6 governs a complex gene expression program. Moreover, CBX6 induced significant downregulation of bone marrow stromal cell antigen-2 (BST2), a potential therapeutic target, via interactions with its promoter region. Our collective findings support a tumor suppressor role of CBX6 in breast cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "MRI plays important roles in endometrial and cervical cancer assessment, from detection to recurrent disease evaluation. Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common malignant tumor of the female genital tract in Western countries. EC patients are divided into risk categories based on histopathological tumor type, grade, and myometrial invasion depth. EC is surgically staged using the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) system. Since FIGO (2009) stage correlates with prognosis, preoperative staging is essential for tailored treatment. MRI reveals myometrial invasion depth, which correlates with tumor grade and lymph node metastases, and thus correlates with prognosis. Cervical cancer (CC) is the second most common cancer, and the third leading cause of cancer-related death among females in developing countries. The FIGO Gynecologic Oncology Committee recently revised its CC staging guidelines, allowing staging based on imaging and pathological findings when available. The revised FIGO (2018) staging includes node involvement and thus enables both therapy selection and evaluation, prognosis estimation, and calculation of end results. MRI can accurately assess prognostic indicators, e.g., tumor size, parametrial invasion, pelvic sidewall, and lymph node invasion. Despite these important roles of MRI, radiologists still face challenges due to the technical and interpretation pitfalls of MRI during all phases of endometrial and cervical cancer evaluation. Awareness of mimics that can simulate both cancers is critical. With careful application, functional MRI with DWI and DCE sequences can help establish a correct diagnosis, although it is sometimes necessary to perform biopsy and histopathological analysis. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

This led to the first biological based liquid biopsy test, which we called MATER-D platform. In the present study, we showed for the first time that a different type of OMCs (PTEN-deficient human epithelial MCF10A cells) turn malignant when exposed to cancer patient’s sera, confirming the concept that different cells with diverse oncosuppressor mutations can uptake cancer factors and be used in biological based liquid biopsy tests. Our observations were confirmed in a large variety of solid and haematological malignancies. This test was able to detect dysplasia and carcinomas in situ lesions in different organs and circulating factors in cancer patients years after the removal of their lesions. To our knowledge, this ability is unique and not shared by other liquid biopsy platforms. Immunohistochemistry analysis of the xenotransplants revealed identical patterns of differentiation regardless of the cancer type, showing that differentiation through horizontal transfer might be dependent on the nature of the target cells rather than the type of cancer factors. These data strengthen the notion that OMC-based liquid biopsy tests might be promising platforms for cancer screening. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Various studies have shown the significance of identifying drug targets for cancer, although this process continues challenging in the field of anti-cancer drug designing. The primary purpose of this study is to design a novel approach to identify target genes for cancer. The sub-network of colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancers were constructed from human protein–protein interaction network. The potential genes were analyzed using hubs and centrality measures. For the identification of target genes, we retrieve those genes that had the highest score in both mutation rates and graph centrality. Moreover, gene deletion analysis revealed that MYC, TP53, and EGFR genes remained potential targets in colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancer respectively. Results suggest that combining network measures with mutation frequencies in cancer genes might assist in recognizing several potential drug targets. Future enhancement of this current approach is to combine these network properties with the biological insights from gene expression data, and their functions will provide a reliable method for rational drug designing. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature." ;

Owing to enhanced permeability and retention in solid tumor tissue, nanoparticle (NP) delivery systems have been emerged as novel strategy in cancer chemotherapy. As extracellular matrix, glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) could bind its surface receptor adhesion molecule CD44 which is strongly expressed on breast cancer. We have previously reported a doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded HA-Lys-LA X-NPs (X-NP-DOX) NP delivery system for breast cancer treatment. In this study, we further investigated the antitumor effect of X-NP-DOX NP delivery system using low-dose DOX in both in vitro and in vivo systems. We demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX possessed the ability for inhibiting MCF-7 breast cancer cell growth, invasion, and migration, and inducing apoptosis in vitro. In in vivo experiments, injection of low-dose X-NP-DOX into tumor-bearing mouse resulted in significant reduction of tumor size. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining further revealed that low-dose X-NP-DOX induced higher percentage of apoptotic cells compared with free DOX or saline. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX inhibited Notch1 and Ras/MAPK pathways, decreased cancer stem cell population, and reduced tumorigenesis compared to free DOX in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Owing to its enhanced efficacy and higher targetability compared to free DOX, low-dose DOX delivered by NP system may be a promising novel strategy for breast cancer treatment." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Breast cancer survivors display altered inflammatory responses to immune challenges relative to cancer-naive controls likely due to previous cancer treatments, stress associated with cancer, and/or tumor physiology. Proper inflammatory responses are necessary for adaptive sickness behaviors (e.g., fatigue, anorexia, and fever) and neuroinflammatory pathways are also implicated in mental health disturbances (e.g., cognitive impairment, depression) suffered by cancer patients and survivors. Rodent cancer models indicate that tumors are sufficient to exacerbate neuroinflammatory responses after an immune challenge, however primary tumors are not usually present in cancer survivors, and the behavioral consequences of these brain changes remain understudied. Therefore, we tested the extent to which mammary tumor resection attenuates tumor-induced neuroinflammation and sickness behavior following an immune challenge (i.p. lipopolysaccharide [LPS] injection) in mice. Tnf-α, Il-1β, and Il-6 mRNA decreased in multiple brain regions of LPS-treated tumor-bearing mice relative to LPS-treated controls; tumor resection attenuated these effects in some cases (but not Tnf-α). Tumors also attenuated sickness behaviors (hypothermia and lethargy) compared to LPS-treated controls. Tumor resection reversed these behavioral consequences, although basal body temperature remained elevated, comparable to tumor-bearing mice. Thus, tumors significantly modulate neuroinflammatory pathways with functional consequences and tumor resection mitigates most, but not all, of these changes. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Natural compounds are a realistic source of new bioactive compounds with anticancer activity. Among them, rosemary polyphenols have shown a vast antiproliferative capacity against colon cancer cells in vitro and in animal models. We have investigated the antitumor activity of a rosemary extract (RE) obtained by using supercritical fluid extraction through its capacity to inhibit various signatures of cancer progression and metastasis such as proliferation, migration, invasion and clonogenic survival. RE strongly inhibited proliferation, migration and colony formation of colon cancer cells regardless their phenotype. Treatment with RE led to a sharp increase of intracellular ROS that resulted in necrosis cell death. Nrf2 gene silencing increased RE cytotoxic effects, thus suggesting that this pathway was involved in cell survival. These in vitro results were in line with a reduction of tumor growth by oral administration of RE in a xenograft model of colon cancer cells using athymic nude mice. These findings indicate that targeting colon cancer cells by increasing intracellular ROS and decreasing cell survival mechanisms may suppose a therapeutic option in colon cancer through the combination of rosemary compounds and chemotherapeutic drugs. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Although cure rates are high for early stage disease, clinical outcomes for advanced, metastatic, or recurrent disease remain poor. To change this panorama, a deeper understanding of cervical cancer biology and novel study models are needed. Immortalized human cancer cell lines such as HeLa constitute crucial scientific tools, but there are few other cervical cancer cell lines available, limiting our understanding of a disease known for its molecular heterogeneity. This study aimed to establish novel cervical cancer cell lines derived from Brazilian patients. We successfully established one (HCB-514) out of 35 cervical tumors biopsied. We confirmed the phenotype of HCB-514 by verifying its’ epithelial and tumor origin through cytokeratins, EpCAM and p16 staining. It was also HPV-16 positive. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) showed relevant somatic mutations in several genes including BRCA2, TGFBR1 and IRX2. A copy number variation (CNV) analysis by nanostring and WES revealed amplification of genes mainly related to kinases proteins involved in proliferation, migration and cell differentiation, such as EGFR, PIK3CA, and MAPK7. Overexpression of EGFR was confirmed by phospho RTK-array and validated by western blot analysis. Furthermore, the HCB-514 cell line was sensitive to cisplatin. In summary, this novel Brazilian cervical cancer cell line exhibits relevant key molecular features and constitutes a new biological model for pre-clinical studies. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Oncogene-induced replication stress (RS) promotes cancer development but also impedes tumor growth by activating anti-cancer barriers. To determine how cancer cells adapt to RS, we have monitored the expression of different components of the ATR-CHK1 pathway in primary tumor samples. We show that unlike upstream components of the pathway, the checkpoint mediators Claspin and Timeless are overexpressed in a coordinated manner. Remarkably, reducing the levels of Claspin and Timeless in HCT116 cells to pretumoral levels impeded fork progression without affecting checkpoint signaling. These data indicate that high level of Claspin and Timeless increase RS tolerance by protecting replication forks in cancer cells. Moreover, we report that primary fibroblasts adapt to oncogene-induced RS by spontaneously overexpressing Claspin and Timeless, independently of ATR signaling. Altogether, these data indicate that enhanced levels of Claspin and Timeless represent a gain of function that protects cancer cells from of oncogene-induced RS in a checkpoint-independent manner. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Turmeric, since in ancient Indian traditional medicinal system, has been implicated for its therapeutic and chemopreventive properties against a broad spectrum of diseases. Curcumin, the active polyphenol from turmeric, helps to obstruct the growth of many types of cancers at various stages which include prostrate, melanoma, breast, brain tumor, pancreatic, leukemia, etc. The initiation and recurrence of cancer have been attributed to few mutated cells in bulk of tumor called as cancer stem cells which have the capacity of self-renewal and differentiation. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3B) is a multifunctional serine/threonine protein kinase, originally found in mammals, an important component of diverse signaling pathways, dysregulation of which leads to affect the cancer stem cell properties. The nutritional- and phytochemical-based dietary interventions may complement current chemotherapy to prevent recurrence and relapse of cancer. The objective of present study is to investigate the effect of retinoic acid and curcumin–retinoic acid conjugates against GSK-3B protein. The in silico results indicate that molecule 3 (curcumin–retinoic acid conjugates) might be a potent inhibitor of GSK-3B and a novel future drug candidate for the treatment of cancer. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature." ;

        fabio:abstract    "In this study, we aimed to identify mutations of key genes associated with docetaxel resistance in nine endometrial cancer cell lines. Endometrial cancers are associated with several critical gene mutations, including PIK3A, PTEN, and KRAS. Different gene mutations in endometrial cancer cells have varied responses to anticancer drugs and cancer therapies. The most frequently altered gene in endometrioid endometrial carcinoma tumors is PTEN. PTEN protein has lipid phosphatase and protein phosphatase activity, as well as other functions in the nucleus. Although the tumor-suppressive function of PTEN has mainly been attributed to its lipid phosphatase activity, a role for PTEN protein phosphatase activity in cell cycle regulation has also been suggested. Various tumor type-specific PTEN mutations are well documented. Here, nine endometrioid endometrial cancer cell lines with PIK3A, PTEN, and KRAS gene mutations were treated with docetaxel and radiation. One mutation with a docetaxel drug-resistant effect was a truncated form of PTEN. Among PTEN mutations in endometrial cancer cells, the Y68 frame shift mutation of PTEN constitutes a major mechanism of resistance to docetaxel treatment. The molecular mechanism involves truncation of the 403 amino acid PTEN protein at amino acid 68 by the Y68 frame shift, leading to the loss of PTEN protein phosphatase and lipid phosphatase activities. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Hence to mimic such complex biological processes, an understanding of stimuli responsiveness is needed to sense specific changes and respond in a predictable manner. Such responses due to polymers may take place either simultaneously at the site or in a sequential manner from preparation to transporting pathways to cellular compartments. The present review comprehends the stimuli-responsive polymers and multi-responsiveness with respect to cancer therapy. It focuses on the exploitation of different stimuli like temperature, pH and enzymes responsiveness in a multi-stimuli setting. Nanogels and micelles being two of the most commonly used responsive polymeric carriers have also been discussed. The role of multiple stimuli delivery system is significant due to multiple changes happening in the near surroundings of cancer cells. These responsive materials are able to mimic some biological processes and recognize at the molecular level itself to manipulate development of custom-designed molecules for targeting cancer cells." ;

In contrast, antibodies to BLV were found in a very small percentage of healthy blood donors. There was no association between BLV DNA and other tumor prognostic biological markers such as hormonal receptors, HER2 oncoprotein, proliferation index, metastasis in sentinels lymph nodes, and tumor grade and size.

Here we report that ovarian cancer cells manifest a spectrum of tumorigenic phenotypes upon knockdown of PIK3R1. PIK3R1 loss activates AKT and p110-independent JAK2/STAT3 signaling through inducing changes in the phosphorylation of the docking protein Gab2, thereby relieving the negative inhibition on AKT and promoting the assembly of JAK2/STAT3 signalosome, respectively. Additional mechanisms leading to AKT activation include enhanced p110α kinase activity and a decrease in PTEN level. PIK3R1 loss renders ovarian cancer cells vulnerable to inhibition of AKT or JAK2/STAT3. The combination of AKT and STAT3 inhibitors significantly increases the anti-tumor effect compared to single-agent treatments.

Finally, analysis of 214 prostate and 35 breast cancer genomes reveal that late-replicating regions are prone to cis and early-replication to trans chromosomal rearrangements.

        fabio:abstract    "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are promising therapies for haematological cancers. Historically, their therapeutic benefit is due to ADC targeting of lineage-restricted antigens. The C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is attractive for targeted therapy of haematological cancers, given its expression in multiple tumour types and role in cancer “homing” to bone marrow. However, CXCR4 is also expressed in haematopoietic cells and other normal tissues, raising safety challenges to the development of anti-CXCR4 ADCs for cancer treatment. Here, we designed the first anti-CXCR4 ADC with favourable therapeutic index, effective in xenografts of haematopoietic cancers resistant to standard of care and anti-CXCR4 antibodies. We screened multiple ADC configurations, by varying type of linker-payload, drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR), affinity and Fc format. The optimal ADC bears a non-cleavable linker, auristatin as payload at DAR = 4 and a low affinity antibody with effector–reduced Fc. Contrary to other drugs targeting CXCR4, anti-CXCR4 ADCs effectively eliminated cancer cells as monotherapy, while minimizing leucocytosis. The optimal ADC selectively eliminated CXCR4 + cancer cells in solid tumours, but showed limited toxicity to normal CXCR4 + tissues, sparing haematopoietic stem cells and progenitors. Our work provides proof-of-concept that through empirical ADC design, it is possible to target proteins with broad normal tissue expression. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Cancers in the bone produce a number of severe symptoms including pain that compromises patient functional status, quality of life, and survival. The source of this pain is multifaceted and includes factors secreted from tumor cells. Malignant cells release the neurotransmitter and cell-signaling molecule glutamate via the oxidative stress-related cystine/glutamate antiporter, system x C − , which reciprocally imports cystine for synthesis of glutathione and the cystine/cysteine redox cycle. Pharmacological inhibition of system x C − has shown success in reducing and delaying the onset of cancer pain-related behavior in mouse models. This investigation describes the development of a stable siRNA-induced knockdown of the functional trans-membrane system x C − subunit xCT (SLC7A11) in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Clones were verified for xCT knockdown at the transcript, protein, and functional levels. RNAseq was performed on a representative clone to comprehensively examine the transcriptional cellular signature in response to xCT knockdown, identifying multiple differentially regulated factors relevant to cancer pain including nerve growth factor, interleukin-1, and colony-stimulating factor-1. Mice were inoculated intrafemorally and recordings of pain-related behaviors including weight bearing, mechanical withdrawal, and limb use were performed. Animals implanted with xCT knockdown cancer cells displayed a delay until the onset of nociceptive behaviors relative to control cells. These results add to the body of evidence suggesting that a reduction in glutamate release from cancers in bone by inhibition of the system x C − transporter may decrease the severe and intractable pain associated with bone metastases. © The Author(s) 2019." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Background: The global cancer incidence and the number of survivors are increasing. Therefore, it is necessary to pay more attention to the side effects of treatment. Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of reflexology on the side effects of chemotherapy in cancer patients. Method: For finding the related articles, the researchers searched several databases including PubMed &ProQuest and valid websites including ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Scientific Information Database, and Magiran. The key terms of \"reflexology, cancer, and chemotherapy\" individually and combined together were searched in Parisian and English, and the studies performed from 2009 to 2018 were extracted. Due to the lack of sufficient studies carried out into the outcome of reflexology on chemotherapy, both Persian and English articles were used. Results: A total of 57 studies were extracted from the databases and valid websites; five of which met the inclusion criteria. All selected studies were clinical trials. Implications for Practice: Reflexology can be used as a non-pharmacologic nursing intervention to alleviate the side effects of chemotherapy and improve the quality of life of cancer patients. © 2019 Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

        fabio:abstract    "CD47 is a prominent new target in cancer immunotherapy, with antagonistic antibodies currently being evaluated in clinical trials. For effective evaluation of this strategy it is crucial to identify which patients are suited for CD47-targeted therapy. In this respect, expression of the pro-phagocytic signal SLAMF7 on both macrophages and cancer cells was recently reported to be a requisite for CD47 antibody-mediated phagocytosis. Here, we demonstrate that in fact SLAMF7 expression on cancer cells is not required and does not impact on CD47 antibody therapy. Moreover, SLAMF7 also does not impact on phagocytosis induction by CD20 antibody rituximab nor associates with overall survival of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma patients. In contrast, expression of CD47 negatively impacts on overall and progression free survival. In conclusion, cancer cell expression of SLAMF7 is not required for phagocytosis and, in contrast to CD47 expression, should not be used as selection criterion for CD47-targeted therapy. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Increased Crabp2 levels have been found in various types of cancer, and are associated with poor patients’ survival. Although Crabp2 is found to be overexpressed in lung cancer, its role in metastasis of lung cancer is unclear. In this study, Crabp2 was overexpressed in high-metastatic C10F4 than low-metastatic lung cancer cells. Analysis of clinical samples revealed that high CRABP2 levels were correlated with lymph node metastases, poor overall survival, and increased recurrence. Knockdown of Crabp2 decreased migration, invasion, anoikis resistance, and in vivo metastasis. Crabp2 was co-immunoprecipitated with HuR, and overexpression of Crabp2 increased HuR levels, which promoted integrin β1/FAK/ERK signaling. Inhibition of HuR or integrin β1/FAK/ERK signaling reversed the promoting effect of Crabp2 in migration, invasion, and anoikis resistance. Knockdown of Crabp2 further inhibited the growth of cancer cells as compared with that by gemcitabine or irinotecan alone. The expression of Crabp2 in human lung tumors was correlated with stress marker CHOP. In conclusion, our findings have identified the promoting role of Crabp2 in anoikis resistance and metastasis. CRABP2 may serve as a prognostic marker and targeting CRABP2 may be exploited as a modality to reduce metastasis. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "SPG-56 is a newly isolated glycoprotein from sweet potatoes (Zhongshu NO. 1), but its value for suppressing breast cancer progression remains unknown. This study was designed to investigate the potential anti-cancer effects of SPG-56, which consists of 2.9% sugar and 97.1% protein. The effects of SPG-56 on the proliferation and apoptosis of breast cancer cells were determined using CCK-8 and Hoechst 33342 assays and flow cytometry, after staining with Annexin V and PI respectively. The activities of SPG-56 against breast cancer were examined using female BALB/c nude mice orthotopically implanted with human breast carcinoma cells of the types MCF-7 and 4T1-Luc. The cellular experiments showed that SPG-56 inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of MCF-7 cells dose- and time-dependently. Oral administration of SPG-56 significantly suppressed the development of MCF-7 tumor cells (P < 0.01) as compared with an untreated group. The serum tumor markers CEA, CA125 and CA153 in a 240 mg/kg/d SPG-56 decreased by 54.8%, 91.8%, and 90.3%, respectively. The experiments further demonstrated that SPG-56 inhibited the metastasis of breast cancer in MCF-7 and 4T1-bearing mice by altering the expression of MMP2, MMP9, VEGF, Occludin and Claudin. It is concluded that SPG-56 may have potential as a novel anti-tumor candidate for breast cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Lymph node metastasis is of major prognostic significance for breast cancer. Lymph node metastasis arises at a very early stage in some patients. Using the data downloaded from the TCGA database, we studied the differences between primary tumors with and without lymph node metastasis at the multi-omics level using bioinformatics approaches. Our study found that low mutation and neoantigen burdens correlated with lymph node metastazation of breast cancer. All three conserved domains in TP53 were mutated in lymph node-negative breast cancers, whereas only one domain was mutated in lymph node-positive samples. Mutations in microtubule-related proteins appear to help immune cells recognize tumors and inhibit their lymph node metastasis. Destroying microtubule-related proteins is a potential therapeutic strategy to inhibit lymph node metastasis of breast cancer. As the neoantigens specifically present in lymph node-positive breast cancers, MAPK10, BC9L, TRIM65, CD93, KITLG, CNPPD1, CPED1, CCDC146, TMEM185A, INO80D, and PSMD11 are potential targets for vaccine design. In the tumor microenvironment, reduced numbers of effector immune cells, especially activated memory CD4+ T cells and activated mast cells, facilitate breast cancer metastasis to the lymph nodes. According to transcriptome data, lymph node metastasis was mostly driven by gene mutation rather than by gene expression. Although differential gene expression analysis was based on lymph node metastasis status, many genes were shown to be differentially expressed based on estrogen receptor status. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Fibroblasts turn into cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumour microenvironment. CAFs have recently attracted attention for their function as a regulator of immune cell recruitment and function in addition to their tumour-promoting roles. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of CAFs on monocyte recruitment and macrophage polarization in breast cancer. CAFs, which were α-SMA expressing fibroblasts in contrast to normal fibroblasts (NFs), effectively recruited monocytes. Recruitment of monocytes by CAFs might be mediated by monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) as well as stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) cytokines. CAFs differentiated the recruited monocytes into M2-like macrophages which are capable of exerting their immunosuppressive roles via the PD-1 axis. CAF-educated monocytes exhibited strong immune suppression unlike NF-educated monocytes and enhanced the motility/invasion of breast cancer cells in addition to increasing the expressions of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes and vimentin protein in cancer cells. CAF-educated M1 macrophages displayed increased expression of M2 markers and production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in contrast to decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12 compared with control M1 macrophages; suggesting that CAFs were also able to induce the trans-differentiation of M1 macrophages to M2 macrophages. We then investigated the relationship between the infiltration of CAFs and tumour associated macrophages (TAMs) using tissue samples obtained from breast cancer patients. High grade of CAFs significantly correlated with the number of TAMs in human breast cancer tissue samples. It was also associated with higher Ki-67 proliferation index, and higher tumour volume. This result is in line with our finding of increased breast cancer cell proliferation due to the effects of CAF-educated monocytes in vitro. Our results concluded that CAFs play pivotal roles in sculpturing the tumour microenvironment in breast cancer, and therapeutic strategies to reverse the CAF-mediated immunosuppressive microenvironment should be taken into consideration. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

We construct iCells of four cancers and the corresponding tissue controls and identify the most rewired genes in cancer.

We biologically validate that they have a role in cancer by knockdown experiments followed by cell viability assays.

Our method achieves an accuracy of 96% for RNA-seq and 95% for mixed DNA-seq and RNA-seq identification. Even for a panel of only 94 cancer-related genes, accuracy remains at 82% but decreases when using smaller panels.

The angular spectra of scattering coefficient maps of normal tissues exhibit a spatial feature distinct from those of abnormal tissues. An angular spectrum index to quantify the differences between the normal and abnormal tissues is derived, and its strength in revealing subsurface cancer in ex vivo samples is statistically analyzed.

        fabio:abstract    "Metastatic colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer death. Current options in palliation such as hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) present severe side effects. Recent research efforts suggested the therapeutic use of oxidant-enriched liquid using cold physical plasma. To investigate a clinically accepted treatment regimen, we assessed the antitumor capacity of plasma-treated saline solution. In response to such liquid, CT26 murine colon cancer cells were readily oxidized and showed cell growth with subsequent apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and upregulation of immunogenic cell death (ICD) markers in vitro. This was accompanied by marked morphological changes with re-arrangement of actin fibers and reduced motility. Induction of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype was not observed. Key results were confirmed in MC38 colon and PDA6606 pancreatic cancer cells. Compared to plasma-treated saline, hydrogen peroxide was inferiorly toxic in 3D tumor spheroids but of similar efficacy in 2D models. In vivo, plasma-treated saline decreased tumor burden in Balb/C mice. This was concomitant with elevated numbers of intratumoral macrophages and increased T cell activation following incubation with CT26 cells ex vivo. Being a potential adjuvant for HIPEC therapy, our results suggest oxidizing saline solutions to inactivate colon cancer cells while potentially stimulating antitumor immune responses. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Although solid fuel combustion emissions are known to increase the prevalence of illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer, however, their effect on the eyes is underexplored. This study assesses the acute toxicity of solid fuel combustion emissions on healthy ocular cells and a cancer cell line. Three healthy ocular cell lines (corneal, lens, and retinal epithelial cells) and a cancer cell line (Chinese hamster ovary cells) were exposed to liquid and gas phase emissions from applewood and coal combustion. Following the exposure, real-time cell attachment behavior was monitored for at least 120 hours with electrical cell impedance spectroscopy. The viability of the cells, amount of apoptotic cells, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were quantified with MTT, ApoTox-Glo, and ROS-Glo H 2 O 2 assays, respectively. The results showed that coal emissions compromised the viability of ocular cells more than applewood emissions. Interestingly, the cancer cells, although their viability was not compromised, generated 1.7 to 2.7 times more ROS than healthy cells. This acute exposure study provides compelling proof that biomass combustion emissions compromise the viability of ocular cells and increase ROS generation. The increased ROS generation was fatal for ocular cells, but it promoted the growth of cancer cells. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) include endogenous metabolites that provide information about health and disease which might be useful to develop a better screening method for breast cancer. The goal of this study was to classify mice with and without tumors and compare tumors localized to the mammary pad and tumor cells injected into the iliac artery by differences in VOCs in urine. After 4T1.2 tumor cells were injected into BALB/c mice either in the mammary pad or into the iliac artery, urine was collected, VOCs from urine headspace were concentrated by solid phase microextraction and results were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry quadrupole time-of-flight. Multivariate and univariate statistical analyses were employed to find potential biomarkers for breast cancer and metastatic breast cancer in mice models. A set of six VOCs classified mice with and without tumors with an area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC AUC) of 0.98 (95% confidence interval [0.85, 1.00]) via five-fold cross validation. Classification of mice with tumors in the mammary pad and iliac artery was executed utilizing a different set of six VOCs, with a ROC AUC of 0.96 (95% confidence interval [0.75, 1.00]). © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

In an additional two metastatic colon cancer patients, we detected CD8 + neoantigen-specific cells targeting the mutated SMAD5 and MUC4 proteins.

Moreover, the high drug loading capacity of Cet-SLN was employed to encapsulate photothermal agent indocyanine green (ICG) to finally fabricate a versatile drug delivery system (DDS) able to co-deliver Cet and ICG (Cet-SLN/ICG) for combinational chemo-photothermal therapy of breast cancer. The obtained results clearly demonstrated that Cet-SLN/ICG was well-dispersed nanoparticles with preferable stability under physiological condition. Furthermore, due to the conjugation of Cet, Cet-SLN/ICG could target EGFR which overexpress in MCF-7 cells. Most importantly, both in vitro and in vivo results suggested that compared with Cet or ICG alone, the Cet-SLN/ICG showed superior anticancer efficacy. In conclusion, Cet-SLN/ICG could be a potential platform for effective combinational chemo-photothermal therapy for breast cancer." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The integration of genomic and DNA methylation data has been demonstrated as a powerful strategy in understanding cancer mechanisms and identifying therapeutic targets. The TCGA consortium has mapped DNA methylation in thousands of cancer samples using Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 K BeadChip (Illumina 450 K array) that only covers about 1.5% of CpGs in the human genome. Therefore, increasing the coverage of the DNA methylome would significantly leverage the usage of the TCGA data. Here, we present a new model called EAGLING that can expand the Illumina 450 K array data 18 times to cover about 30% of the CpGs in the human genome. We applied it to analyze 13 cancers in TCGA. By integrating the expanded methylation, gene expression, and somatic mutation data, we identified the genes showing differential patterns in each of the 13 cancers. Many of the triple-evidenced genes identified in majority of the cancers are biomarkers or potential biomarkers. Pan-cancer analysis also revealed the pathways in which the triple-evidenced genes are enriched, which include well known ones as well as new ones, such as axonal guidance signaling pathway and pathways related to inflammatory processing or inflammation response. Triple-evidenced genes, particularly TNXB, RRM2, CELSR3, SLC16A3, FANCI, MMP9, MMP11, SIK1, and TRIM59 showed superior predictive power in both tumor diagnosis and prognosis. These results have demonstrated that the integrative analysis using the expanded methylation data is powerful in identifying critical genes/pathways that may serve as new therapeutic targets. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

However, macrophages make up a majority of immune cell infiltrates into tumors, creating natural targets for immunotherapies able to direct macrophages away from tumor-supportive functions and toward anti-tumor phenotypes. Recent studies demonstrate that toll-like receptors (TLRs) – pathways that quickly trigger early immune responses – play an important role in polarizing macrophages. Here, we present emerging ways in which TLR signaling is being manipulated in macrophages to create new opportunities for cancer immunotherapy. In particular, we discuss approaches to deliver TLR agonists, to leverage biomaterials in these therapies, and to couple TLR-based approaches with other frontline treatments as combination cancer therapies. © 2019" ;

We analyzed the immune profiles, T cell cytotoxicity, and TCR repertoire of peripheral blood, normal lung tissue, and tumor tissue from NSCLC patients. By using bispecific T-cell engager technology to assess the cytotoxicity of T cells, we found that the cytotoxicity of tumor-infiltrated T cells closely correlated with that of peripheral T cells. This correlation was supported by the immune profiles, cytokine production, and results of the TCR repertoire analysis from these specimens. We also found that the cytotoxicity of peripheral T cells has potential as a predictor of the effects of nivolumab in the tumor microenvironment.

This standard procedure relies on the slow radioactivity loss, usually attributed to the limited tumour expression of G6P-phosphatase (G6Pase). However, this classical interpretation intrinsically represents an approximation since, as in all tissues, cancer G6Pase activity is remarkable and is confined to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whose lumen must be reached by phosphorylated FDG to explain its hydrolysis and radioactivity release. The present study tested the impact of G6Pase sequestration on the mathematical description of FDG trafficking and handling in cultured cancer cells. Our data show that accounting for tracer access to the ER configures this compartment as the preferential site of FDG accumulation. This is confirmed by the reticular localization of fluorescent FDG analogues. Remarkably enough, reticular accumulation rate of FDG is dependent upon extracellular glucose availability, thus configuring the same ER as a significant determinant of cancer glucose metabolism. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Although current methods of treatment for cervical cancer can ablate lesions, preventing metastatic disseminations and excessive tissue injuries still remains a major concern. Hence, development of a safer and more efficient treatment modality is of vital importance. Natural products from plants are one of the principal sources of precursors to lead compounds with direct pharmaceutical application across all disease classes. One of these plants is Ficus carica, whose fruit latex, when applied on HPV-induced skin warts, has shown potential as a possible cure for this virus related lesions. This study explores the in vitro biological activities of fig latex and elucidates its possible mechanisms of action on cervical cancer cell lines CaSki and HeLa positive for HPV type 16 and 18, respectively. Our data shows that fig latex inhibits properties that are associated with HPV-positive cervical cancer transformed cells such as rapid growth and invasion and substantially downregulated the expression of p16 and HPV onco-proteins E6, E7. These findings suggest Ficus carica latex has the potential to be used in the development of therapeutic modalities for the possible treatment, cure and prevention of HPV related cervical cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing methods, the diversity and composition of the microbiota from ovarian cancer tissues (25 samples) and normal distal fallopian tube tissues (25 samples) were analyzed. High-throughput sequencing showed that the diversity and richness indexes were significantly decreased in ovarian cancer tissues compared to tissues from normal distal fallopian tubes. The ratio of the two phyla for Proteobacteria/Firmicutes was notably increased in ovarian cancer, which revealed that microbial composition change might be associated with the process of ovarian cancer development. In addition, transcriptome-sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses suggested that the transcriptional profiles were statistically different between ovarian carcinoma and normal distal fallopian tubes. Moreover, a set of genes including 84 different inflammation-associated or immune-associated genes, which had been named as the human antibacterial-response genes were also modulated expression.

        fabio:abstract    "Several pioneering work have established that apart from genetic alterations, epigenetic modifications contribute significantly in tumor progression. Remarkable role of EZH2 in cancer highlights the importance of identifying its targets. Although much emphasis has been placed in recent years in designing drugs and inhibitors targeting EZH2, less effort has been given in exploring its existing targets that will help in understanding the oncogenic role of EZH2 in turn which may provide a more stringent method of targeting EZH2. In the present study, we validated six direct targets of EZH2 that are GPNMB, PMEPA1, CoL5A1, VGLL4, POMT2 and SUMF1 associated with cancer related pathways. Upon EZH2 knockdown, more than two fold increase in the target gene expression was evident. CHIP-qPCR performed in both MCF-7 and MDA-MDA-231 confirmed the in-vivo binding of EZH2 on its identified target. Thirty invasive breast carcinoma cases with their adjacent normal tissues were included in the study. Immunohistochemistry in primary breast tumor tissue array showed tumor dependent expression of EZH2. Array of MERAV expression database revealed the strength of association of EZH2 with its target genes. Real time PCR performed with RNA extracted from breast tumor tissues further authenticated the existing negative correlation between EZH2 and its target genes. Pearson correlation coefficient & statistical significance computed using the matrix provided in the database strengthened the negative correlation between identified target genes and EZH2. KM plotter analysis showed improved relapse-free survival with increased expression of PMEPA1, POMT2, VGLL4 and SUMF1 in breast cancer patients indicating their therapeutic potential. While investigating the relevance of these target genes, different mutations of them were found in breast cancer patients. Seeking the clinical relevance of our study, following our recent publication that reports the role of EZH2 in nicotine-mediated breast cancer development and progression, we observed significant reduced expression of SUMF1 in breast cancer patient samples with smoking history in comparison to never-smoked patient samples. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we report that TOP1MT is overexpressed in cancer tissues and demonstrate that TOP1MT deficiency attenuates tumor growth in human and mouse models of colon and liver cancer. Due to their mitochondrial dysfunction, TOP1MT-KO cells become addicted to glycolysis, which limits synthetic building blocks and energy supply required for the proliferation of cancer cells in a nutrient-deprived tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, we show that TOP1MT associates with mitoribosomal subunits, ensuring optimal mitochondrial translation and assembly of oxidative phosphorylation complexes that are critical for sustaining tumor growth. The TOP1MT genomic signature profile, based on Top1mt-KO liver cancers, is correlated with enhanced survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Our results highlight the importance of TOP1MT for tumor development, providing a potential rationale to develop TOP1MT-targeted drugs as anticancer therapies. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

A new data integrative approach, based on graphical models, was applied on our multi-modal –omics, and clinical data cohort of metastatic melanoma patients. We found that response to chemotherapy is directly linked to ten gene expression, four methylation variables and PARP1 SNP rs1805407. PARP1 is a DNA repair gene critical for chemotherapy response and for which FDA-approved inhibitors are clinically available (olaparib). We demonstrated that two PARP inhibitors (ABT-888 and olaparib) make SNP carrier cancer cells of various histologic subtypes more sensitive to alkylating agents, but they have no effect in wild-type cells. Furthermore, PARP1 inhibitors act synergistically with chemotherapy in SNP carrier cells (especially in ovarian cancer for which olaparib is FDA-approved), but they are additive at best in wild-type cancer cells. Taken together, our results suggest that the combination of chemotherapy and PARP1 inhibition may benefit the carriers of rs1805407 in the future and may be used in personalized therapy strategies to select patients that are more likely to respond to PARP inhibitors. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Cancer remains one of the biggest threats to human society. There are massive demands for compounds to selectively kill cancerous cells. Earlier studies have shown that bovine α -lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells (BAMLET) becomes cytotoxic against cancer cells in complex with oleic acid {Hoque, M. et. al., PLoSOne8, e68390 (2013)}. In our study, we obtained bovine α-lactalbumin complexed with lanthanum ion (La 3+ -B-α-LA) and determined its high resolution crystal structure. The natural calcium binding site of bovine α-lactalbumin is replaced by lanthanum. The La 3+ complex formation by B-α-apo-LA was also supported by various biophysical methods. Interestingly, our complex, La 3+ -B-α-LA exhibits much greater anticancer activity against breast cancer cells as compared to the reported BAMLET-oleic acid complex. This study shows that La 3+ -B-α-LA complex is preferentially more toxic to MCF-7 cells as compared to KB (oral cancer) and HeLa (cervical) cells, while almost non-toxic to the healthy cells that we studied. Our data indicates that the cytotoxicity of La 3+ -B-α-LA against cancer cells is through apoptotic path way. The higher anticancer activity of La 3+ -B-α-LA is attributable to the requisite structural changes induced in the protein by La 3+ binding as supported by the crystal structure of the complex. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

However, no studies have evaluated vascular pain in patients with colorectal cancer in relation to peripheral venous administration of chemotherapy with or without oxaliplatin. We evaluated oxaliplatin-induced vascular pain using subjective and objective methods. We determined if oxaliplatin induced vascular pain in patients with colorectal cancer using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and a PainVision PS-2100 device. We compared VAS score between chemotherapy regimens with or without oxaliplatin, and between genders. We also examined the correlations of VAS score with pain intensity examined by the PainVision PS-2100, and with age and vessel diameter. A total of 98 patients with colorectal cancer were enrolled in this study, including 78 patients who received oxaliplatin via peripheral venous administration and 20 who received chemotherapy without oxaliplatin. The median VAS scores in patients with and without oxaliplatin were 36.5 (interquartile range 9.0–60.0) and 0 (0–4.0), respectively (P < 0.001), and the median pain intensities according to PainVision were 43.5 (14.3–98) and 36.5 (9.3–58.5), respectively (P < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between VAS and pain intensity (r = 0.584), but no correlation between VAS score and age (r = −0.174) or vessel diameter (r = −0.107).

One of the emerging techniques with tremendous power for lung cancer therapy is magnetic aerosol drug targeting (MADT). The use of a permanent magnet for effective drug delivery in a desired location throughout the lung requires extensive optimization, but it has not been addressed yet. In the present study, the possibility of using a permanent magnet for trapping the particles on a lung tumor is evaluated numerically in the Weibel's model from G0 to G3. The effect of different parameters is considered on the efficiency of particle deposition in a tumor located on a distant position of the lung bronchi and bronchioles. Also, the effective position of the magnetic source, tumor size, and location are the objectives for particle deposition. The results show that a limited particle deposition occurs on the lung branches in passive targeting. However, the incorporation of a permanent magnet next to the tumor enhanced the particle deposition fraction on G2 to up to 49% for the particles of 7 µm diameter. Optimizing the magnet size could also improve the particle deposition fraction by 68%. It was also shown that the utilization of MADT is essential for effective drug delivery to the tumors located on the lower wall of airway branches given the dominance of the air velocity and resultant drag force in this region. The results demonstrated the high competence and necessity of MADT as a noninvasive drug delivery method for lung cancer therapy." ;

Adjuvant chemotherapy has significantly reduced mortality but increased cognitive impairments, including attention function, making quality of life issues a crucial concern. This study enrolled nineteen breast cancer patients who were treated with standard chemotherapy within 6 months and 20 sex-matched healthy controls to investigate the brain effects of chemotherapy. All participants underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) with mean fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (mfALFF) analysis and were correlated with neuropsychological tests, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised (CAMS-R), and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), to explore the possible underlying mechanism of cognitive alternations. We found increased mfALFF over the frontoparietal lobe and decreased mfALFF over the occipital lobe in the cancer patients compared with the healthy controls; the altered brain regions may be associated with the dorsal attention network (DAN) and may be explained by a compensatory mechanism. Both MMSE and CAMS-R scores showed a positive correlation with mfALFF in the occipital lobe but a negative correlation in the frontoparietal lobe. By contrast, IES-R scores showed a positive correlation with mfALFF in the frontoparietal lobe but a negative correlation in the occipital lobe. These alterations are potentially related to the effects of both chemotherapy and psychological distress.

Mutations that occur in certain splicing factor genes themselves have been implicated in many cancers, particularly myelodysplastic syndromes. Small molecules that target splicing factors have been developed as therapies to preferentially induce apoptosis in these cancer cells.

There have been many attempts to identify markers and key pathways induced throughout EMT but the process is complex and depends on the cancer type and tumour microenvironment. Here we used the colon cancer cell line HT29, which stably overexpressed Snail, the key transcription factor in early EMT, as a model for colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with a pro-metastatic phenotype. We investigated miRNA expression regulation during that phenotypic switching. We found that overexpression of Snail in HT29 cells triggered significant changes in individual miRNA levels but did not change the global efficiency of miRNA processing. Snail abundance repressed the expression of miR-192 and miR-194 and increased miR-205, let-7i and SNORD13 levels. These identified changes correlated with the reported transcriptomic alterations in Snail-overexpressing HT29 cells. We also investigated how Snail affected the miRNA content of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from HT29 cells.

        fabio:abstract    "Solid malignancies are associated with the development of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP). This study aimed to evaluate the risk factors for PJP among patients with lung cancer. This retrospective case-control study compared patients who had lung cancer with PJP (n = 112) or without PJP (n = 336) matched according to age, sex, histopathology, and stage. PJP definition was based on (i) positive PCR or direct immunofluorescence results for pneumocystis, (ii) clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities that were consistent with a pneumonic process, and (iii) received targeted PJP treatment. The development of PJP was associated with radiotherapy (RTx), concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRTx), lymphopenia, and prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (20 mg of prednisolone equivalent per day for ≥3 weeks). Multivariate analysis revealed independent associations with prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06–3.63; p = 0.032) and CCRTx (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.27–3.43; p = 0.004). Steroid use was frequently related to RTx pneumonitis or esophagitis (29 patients, 43.3%). Prolonged high-dose steroid therapy and CCRTx were risk factors for PJP development among patients with lung cancer. As these patients had a poor prognosis, clinicians should consider PJP prophylaxis for high-risk patients with lung cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we compared The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) breast cancer genomic datasets (array and next generation sequencing (NGS) data) in detecting genomic alterations in clinically relevant genes. We performed an in silico analysis to determine the concordance in the frequencies of actionable mutations and copy number alterations/aberrations (CNAs) in the two most common breast cancer histologies, invasive lobular and invasive ductal carcinoma. We found that targeted sequencing identified a larger number of mutational hotspots and clinically significant amplifications that would have been missed by WES and SNP arrays in many actionable genes such as PIK3CA, EGFR, AKT3, FGFR1, ERBB2, ERBB3 and ESR1. The striking differences between the number of mutational hotspots and CNAs generated from these platforms highlight a number of factors that should be considered in the interpretation of array and NGS-based genomic data for precision medicine. Targeted panel sequencing was preferable to WES to define the full spectrum of somatic mutations present in a tumor. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Several oxaliplatin transporters were previously identified but their relative contributions to determining oxaliplatin tumour responses and gastrointestinal tumour cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin remains unclear. We studied clinical associations between tumour expression of oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes and patient response to oxaliplatin, then experimentally verified associations found with MRP2 in models of human gastrointestinal cancer. Among 18 oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes, MRP2 was the only one to be differentially expressed in the tumours of colorectal cancer patients who did or did not respond to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Over-expression of MRP2 (endogenously in HepG2 and PANC-1 cells, or induced by stable transfection of HEK293 cells) decreased oxaliplatin accumulation and cytotoxicity but those deficits were reversed by inhibition of MRP2 with myricetin or siRNA knockdown. Mice bearing subcutaneous HepG2 tumour xenografts were sensitised to oxaliplatin antitumour activity by concurrent myricetin treatment with little or no increase in toxicity. In conclusion, MRP2 limits oxaliplatin accumulation and response in human gastrointestinal cancer. Screening tumour MRP2 expression levels, to select patients for treatment with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy alone or in combination with a MRP2 inhibitor, could improve treatment outcomes. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

We compare optimized gene signatures for cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin responses in the same cell lines and validate each signature using data from patients with cancer. Supervised support vector machine learning is used to derive gene sets whose expression is related to the cell line GI50 values by backwards feature selection with cross-validation. Specific genes and functional pathways distinguishing sensitive from resistant cell lines are identified by contrasting signatures obtained at extreme and median GI50 thresholds. Ensembles of gene signatures at different thresholds are combined to reduce the dependence on specific GI50 values for predicting drug responses. The most accurate gene signatures for each platin are: cisplatin: BARD1, BCL2, BCL2L1, CDKN2C, FAAP24, FEN1, MAP3K1, MAPK13, MAPK3, NFKB1, NFKB2, SLC22A5, SLC31A2, TLR4, and TWIST1; carboplatin: AKT1, EIF3K, ERCC1, GNGT1, GSR, MTHFR, NEDD4L, NLRP1, NRAS, RAF1, SGK1, TIGD1, TP53, VEGFB, and VEGFC; and oxaliplatin: BRAF, FCGR2A, IGF1, MSH2, NAGK, NFE2L2, NQO1, PANK3, SLC47A1, SLCO1B1, and UGT1A1. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with bladder, ovarian, and colorectal cancer were used to test the cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin signatures, resulting in 71.0%, 60.2%, and 54.5% accuracies in predicting disease recurrence and 59%, 61%, and 72% accuracies in predicting remission, respectively. One cisplatin signature predicted 100% of recurrence in non-smoking patients with bladder cancer (57% disease-free; N = 19), and 79% recurrence in smokers (62% disease-free; N = 35).

MTH1 dephosphorylates oxidized nucleotides, thereby preventing their incorporation into DNA and protecting tumour cells from oxidative DNA damage. Inhibitors of MTH1 (TH588 and (S)-crizotinib) were shown to reduce cancer cell viability. However, the MTH1-dependency of the anti-cancer effects of these drugs has recently been questioned. Here, we have assessed anti-tumour effects of TH588 and (S)-crizotinib in patient-derived 3D colorectal cancer cultures. Hypoxia and reoxygenation – conditions that increase intracellular ROS levels – increased sensitivity to (S)-crizotinib, but not to TH588. (S)-crizotinib reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-MET and ErbB3 whereas TH588 induced a mitotic cell cycle arrest, which was not affected by adding ROS-modulating compounds. Furthermore, we show that both compounds induced DNA damage that could not be prevented by adding the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Moreover, adding ROS-modulating compounds did not alter the reduction in viability in response to TH588 and (S)-crizotinib. We conclude that TH588 and (S)-crizotinib have very clear and distinct anti-tumour effects in 3D colorectal cancer cultures, but that these effects most likely occur through distinct and ROS-independent mechanisms. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Histological iron imaging and contrast-agent free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect these deposits, but their presence in human cancer, and correlation with immunotherapeutic response is largely untested. Here, primarily using these iron imaging approaches, we evaluated the spatial distribution of polarized macrophage populations containing high endogenous levels of iron in preclinical murine models and human breast cancer, and used them as metabolic biomarkers to correlate TAM infiltration with response to immunotherapy in preclinical trials. Macrophage-targeted inhibition of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) by immunotherapy was confirmed to inhibit macrophage accumulation and slow mammary tumor growth in mouse models while also reducing hemosiderin iron-laden TAM accumulation as measured by both iron histology and in vivo iron MRI (FeMRI). Spatial profiling of TAM iron deposit infiltration defined regions of maximal accumulation and response to the CSF1R inhibitor, and revealed differences between microenvironments of human cancer according to levels of polarized macrophage iron accumulation in stromal margins. We therefore demonstrate that iron deposition serves as an endogenous metabolic imaging biomarker of TAM infiltration in breast cancer that has high translational potential for evaluation of immunotherapeutic response. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

The AP2 family also acts as a tumor suppressor. Here we found that p73 and AP2 are able to activate NEU4, a neuraminidase gene, which removes the terminal sialic acid residues from cancer-associated glycans. Under serum starvation, NEU4 was up-regulated and one of the NEU4 target glycans, sialyl Lewis X, was decreased, whereas p73 and AP2 were up-regulated. Sialyl Lewis X levels were not, however, decreased under starvation conditions in p73- or AP2-knockdown cells. p53 and AP2 underwent protein-protein interactions, exerting synergistic effects to activate p21, and interaction of p53 with AP2 was lost in cells expressing the L350P mutation of p53. The homologous residues in p63 and p73 are L423 and L377, respectively. The synergistic effect of p53/p63 with AP2 to activate genes was lost with the L350P/L423P mutation in p53/p63, but p73 bearing the L377P mutation was able to interact with AP2 and exerted its normal synergistic effects. We propose that p73 and AP2 synergistically activate the NEU4 promoter in colon cancer cells. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Treatment with increasing concentrations of HspNPs (25, 50, 75 and 100 µg/mL) resulted in 9.1-, 7-, 12.5- and 12.7-fold in increase in apoptotic cell number. Optimum doses of Hsp and HspNPs were found to increase oxidative damage in C6 glioma cells. MDA levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were found to be significantly elevated at 75 and 100 µg/mL exposure concentration of HspNPs with (p = .002) and (p = .018), respectively for 48-h treatment.

GO exhibits pH-dependent fluorescence emission in the visible/near-infrared, providing a possibility of molecular imaging and pH-sensing. It is also water soluble and has a substantial platform for functionalization, allowing for the delivery of multiple therapeutics. GO physical properties are modified to enhance cellular internalization, producing fluorescent nanoflakes with low (<15%) cytotoxicity at the imaging concentrations of 15 μg/mL. As a result, at lower flake sizes GO rapidly internalizes into HeLa cells with the following 70% fluorescence based clearance at 24 h, assessed by its characteristic emission in red/near-IR. pH-dependence of GO emission is utilized to provide the sensing of acidic extracellular environments of cancer cells. The results demonstrate diminishing green/red (550/630 nm) fluorescence intensity ratios for HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells in comparison to HEK-293 healthy cells suggesting a potential use of GO as a non-invasive optical sensor for cancer microenvironments.

        fabio:abstract    "Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells, represents early stages of metastasis and is a promising target in colorectal cancer (CRC) therapy. There have been many attempts to identify markers and key pathways induced throughout EMT but the process is complex and depends on the cancer type and tumour microenvironment. Here we used the colon cancer cell line HT29, which stably overexpressed Snail, the key transcription factor in early EMT, as a model for colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with a pro-metastatic phenotype. We investigated miRNA expression regulation during that phenotypic switching. We found that overexpression of Snail in HT29 cells triggered significant changes in individual miRNA levels but did not change the global efficiency of miRNA processing. Snail abundance repressed the expression of miR-192 and miR-194 and increased miR-205, let-7i and SNORD13 levels. These identified changes correlated with the reported transcriptomic alterations in Snail-overexpressing HT29 cells. We also investigated how Snail affected the miRNA content of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from HT29 cells. Our data suggest that the presence of Snail significantly alters the complex mRNA/miRNA interactions in the early steps of metastasis and also has an impact on the content of EVs released from HT29 cells. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Solid malignancies are associated with the development of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP). This study aimed to evaluate the risk factors for PJP among patients with lung cancer. This retrospective case-control study compared patients who had lung cancer with PJP (n = 112) or without PJP (n = 336) matched according to age, sex, histopathology, and stage. PJP definition was based on (i) positive PCR or direct immunofluorescence results for pneumocystis, (ii) clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities that were consistent with a pneumonic process, and (iii) received targeted PJP treatment. The development of PJP was associated with radiotherapy (RTx), concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRTx), lymphopenia, and prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (20 mg of prednisolone equivalent per day for ≥3 weeks). Multivariate analysis revealed independent associations with prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06–3.63; p = 0.032) and CCRTx (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.27–3.43; p = 0.004). Steroid use was frequently related to RTx pneumonitis or esophagitis (29 patients, 43.3%). Prolonged high-dose steroid therapy and CCRTx were risk factors for PJP development among patients with lung cancer. As these patients had a poor prognosis, clinicians should consider PJP prophylaxis for high-risk patients with lung cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we compared The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) breast cancer genomic datasets (array and next generation sequencing (NGS) data) in detecting genomic alterations in clinically relevant genes. We performed an in silico analysis to determine the concordance in the frequencies of actionable mutations and copy number alterations/aberrations (CNAs) in the two most common breast cancer histologies, invasive lobular and invasive ductal carcinoma. We found that targeted sequencing identified a larger number of mutational hotspots and clinically significant amplifications that would have been missed by WES and SNP arrays in many actionable genes such as PIK3CA, EGFR, AKT3, FGFR1, ERBB2, ERBB3 and ESR1. The striking differences between the number of mutational hotspots and CNAs generated from these platforms highlight a number of factors that should be considered in the interpretation of array and NGS-based genomic data for precision medicine. Targeted panel sequencing was preferable to WES to define the full spectrum of somatic mutations present in a tumor. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Several oxaliplatin transporters were previously identified but their relative contributions to determining oxaliplatin tumour responses and gastrointestinal tumour cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin remains unclear. We studied clinical associations between tumour expression of oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes and patient response to oxaliplatin, then experimentally verified associations found with MRP2 in models of human gastrointestinal cancer. Among 18 oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes, MRP2 was the only one to be differentially expressed in the tumours of colorectal cancer patients who did or did not respond to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Over-expression of MRP2 (endogenously in HepG2 and PANC-1 cells, or induced by stable transfection of HEK293 cells) decreased oxaliplatin accumulation and cytotoxicity but those deficits were reversed by inhibition of MRP2 with myricetin or siRNA knockdown. Mice bearing subcutaneous HepG2 tumour xenografts were sensitised to oxaliplatin antitumour activity by concurrent myricetin treatment with little or no increase in toxicity. In conclusion, MRP2 limits oxaliplatin accumulation and response in human gastrointestinal cancer. Screening tumour MRP2 expression levels, to select patients for treatment with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy alone or in combination with a MRP2 inhibitor, could improve treatment outcomes. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

We compare optimized gene signatures for cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin responses in the same cell lines and validate each signature using data from patients with cancer. Supervised support vector machine learning is used to derive gene sets whose expression is related to the cell line GI50 values by backwards feature selection with cross-validation. Specific genes and functional pathways distinguishing sensitive from resistant cell lines are identified by contrasting signatures obtained at extreme and median GI50 thresholds. Ensembles of gene signatures at different thresholds are combined to reduce the dependence on specific GI50 values for predicting drug responses. The most accurate gene signatures for each platin are: cisplatin: BARD1, BCL2, BCL2L1, CDKN2C, FAAP24, FEN1, MAP3K1, MAPK13, MAPK3, NFKB1, NFKB2, SLC22A5, SLC31A2, TLR4, and TWIST1; carboplatin: AKT1, EIF3K, ERCC1, GNGT1, GSR, MTHFR, NEDD4L, NLRP1, NRAS, RAF1, SGK1, TIGD1, TP53, VEGFB, and VEGFC; and oxaliplatin: BRAF, FCGR2A, IGF1, MSH2, NAGK, NFE2L2, NQO1, PANK3, SLC47A1, SLCO1B1, and UGT1A1. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with bladder, ovarian, and colorectal cancer were used to test the cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin signatures, resulting in 71.0%, 60.2%, and 54.5% accuracies in predicting disease recurrence and 59%, 61%, and 72% accuracies in predicting remission, respectively. One cisplatin signature predicted 100% of recurrence in non-smoking patients with bladder cancer (57% disease-free; N = 19), and 79% recurrence in smokers (62% disease-free; N = 35).

MTH1 dephosphorylates oxidized nucleotides, thereby preventing their incorporation into DNA and protecting tumour cells from oxidative DNA damage. Inhibitors of MTH1 (TH588 and (S)-crizotinib) were shown to reduce cancer cell viability. However, the MTH1-dependency of the anti-cancer effects of these drugs has recently been questioned. Here, we have assessed anti-tumour effects of TH588 and (S)-crizotinib in patient-derived 3D colorectal cancer cultures. Hypoxia and reoxygenation – conditions that increase intracellular ROS levels – increased sensitivity to (S)-crizotinib, but not to TH588. (S)-crizotinib reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-MET and ErbB3 whereas TH588 induced a mitotic cell cycle arrest, which was not affected by adding ROS-modulating compounds. Furthermore, we show that both compounds induced DNA damage that could not be prevented by adding the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Moreover, adding ROS-modulating compounds did not alter the reduction in viability in response to TH588 and (S)-crizotinib. We conclude that TH588 and (S)-crizotinib have very clear and distinct anti-tumour effects in 3D colorectal cancer cultures, but that these effects most likely occur through distinct and ROS-independent mechanisms. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Histological iron imaging and contrast-agent free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect these deposits, but their presence in human cancer, and correlation with immunotherapeutic response is largely untested. Here, primarily using these iron imaging approaches, we evaluated the spatial distribution of polarized macrophage populations containing high endogenous levels of iron in preclinical murine models and human breast cancer, and used them as metabolic biomarkers to correlate TAM infiltration with response to immunotherapy in preclinical trials. Macrophage-targeted inhibition of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) by immunotherapy was confirmed to inhibit macrophage accumulation and slow mammary tumor growth in mouse models while also reducing hemosiderin iron-laden TAM accumulation as measured by both iron histology and in vivo iron MRI (FeMRI). Spatial profiling of TAM iron deposit infiltration defined regions of maximal accumulation and response to the CSF1R inhibitor, and revealed differences between microenvironments of human cancer according to levels of polarized macrophage iron accumulation in stromal margins. We therefore demonstrate that iron deposition serves as an endogenous metabolic imaging biomarker of TAM infiltration in breast cancer that has high translational potential for evaluation of immunotherapeutic response. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

The AP2 family also acts as a tumor suppressor. Here we found that p73 and AP2 are able to activate NEU4, a neuraminidase gene, which removes the terminal sialic acid residues from cancer-associated glycans. Under serum starvation, NEU4 was up-regulated and one of the NEU4 target glycans, sialyl Lewis X, was decreased, whereas p73 and AP2 were up-regulated. Sialyl Lewis X levels were not, however, decreased under starvation conditions in p73- or AP2-knockdown cells. p53 and AP2 underwent protein-protein interactions, exerting synergistic effects to activate p21, and interaction of p53 with AP2 was lost in cells expressing the L350P mutation of p53. The homologous residues in p63 and p73 are L423 and L377, respectively. The synergistic effect of p53/p63 with AP2 to activate genes was lost with the L350P/L423P mutation in p53/p63, but p73 bearing the L377P mutation was able to interact with AP2 and exerted its normal synergistic effects. We propose that p73 and AP2 synergistically activate the NEU4 promoter in colon cancer cells. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Treatment of C6 glioma cells with HspNPs for 24 and 48 h resulted in dose- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability, with approximate IC50 of 28 and 21 μg/mL, respectively (p = .036 for 24 h, p = .025 for 48 h). The percentage of PCNA positive cells decreased to 20% and 10%, respectively, for Hsp- and HspNP-treated cells at concentration of 100 µg/mL. Treatment with increasing concentrations of HspNPs (25, 50, 75 and 100 µg/mL) resulted in 9.1-, 7-, 12.5- and 12.7-fold in increase in apoptotic cell number. Optimum doses of Hsp and HspNPs were found to increase oxidative damage in C6 glioma cells. MDA levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were found to be significantly elevated at 75 and 100 µg/mL exposure concentration of HspNPs with (p = .002) and (p = .018), respectively for 48-h treatment.

GO exhibits pH-dependent fluorescence emission in the visible/near-infrared, providing a possibility of molecular imaging and pH-sensing. It is also water soluble and has a substantial platform for functionalization, allowing for the delivery of multiple therapeutics. GO physical properties are modified to enhance cellular internalization, producing fluorescent nanoflakes with low (<15%) cytotoxicity at the imaging concentrations of 15 μg/mL. As a result, at lower flake sizes GO rapidly internalizes into HeLa cells with the following 70% fluorescence based clearance at 24 h, assessed by its characteristic emission in red/near-IR. pH-dependence of GO emission is utilized to provide the sensing of acidic extracellular environments of cancer cells. The results demonstrate diminishing green/red (550/630 nm) fluorescence intensity ratios for HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells in comparison to HEK-293 healthy cells suggesting a potential use of GO as a non-invasive optical sensor for cancer microenvironments.

A total of 19,785 newly diagnosed CC patients were registered during 2010–2016, among them only 16,946 (85.6%) with primary CC tumor. There was no difference in treatment modality between DM and non-DM patients. However intergroup assessment showed that type 2DM have significantly higher rate of mortality in both overall mortality (28.3%) and CC-specific (11.7%) as compared to Type 1DM (17.3%; 5.5%) and non DM patients (12.7%; 9.1%) (p < 0.001). Within group assessments showed that Type 2DM patients have better quality of life (mean 7.13 ± 3.67) (p < 0.001) and less distress levels (mean 2.41 ± 0.63) (p < 0.011) as compared to type1 DM (meant 10.54 ± 2.11; 3.19 ± 1.07). This study concluded that T2DM prognostic effect still remained after adjusting demographic and clinical parameters. Type 1 diabetes mellitus showed better OS and CSS then type2 DM. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Despite the widening range of high-throughput platforms and exponential growth of generated data volume, the validation of biomarkers discovered from large-scale data remains a challenging field. In order to tackle cancer heterogeneity and comply with the data dimensionality, a number of network and pathway approaches were invented but rarely systematically applied to this task. We propose a new method, called NEAmarker, for finding sensitive and robust biomarkers at the pathway level. scores from network enrichment analysis transform the original space of altered genes into a lower-dimensional space of pathways. These dimensions are then correlated with phenotype variables. The method was first tested using in vitro data from three anti-cancer drug screens and then on clinical data of The Cancer Genome Atlas. It proved superior to the single-gene and alternative enrichment analyses in terms of (1) universal applicability to different data types with a possibility of cross-platform integration, (2) consistency of the discovered correlates between independent drug screens, and (3) ability to explain differential survival of treated patients. Our new screen of anti-cancer compounds validated the performance of multivariate models of drug sensitivity. The previously proposed methods of enrichment analysis could achieve comparable levels of performance in certain tests. However, only our method could discover predictors of both in vitro response and patient survival given administration of the same drug. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

SPIONs entrapped in the core of the nanocomplex may act as a hyperthermia agent and generate localized heat upon excitation with an alternating magnetic field (AMF), thus enabling a thermo-chemotherapy strategy for cancer treatment. Accordingly, the cytotoxic effect and the mode of cell death triggered by the nanocomplex in combination with AMF were evaluated on two different cancer cell lines with various folate receptor (FR) expression levels, including KB nasopharyngeal cancer cells overexpressing FRs as the model and MCF-7 breast cancer cells with low level of FRs as the blank sample. The obtained results showed that KB cell death was greater than the cell death observed in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, a majority of cell death in both cell lines were related to apoptosis when the folate-modified nanocomplex was used instated of the non-folate-modified nanocomplex. Therefore, functionalizing the nanocomplex with folate modulated the response to thermo-chemotherapy by shifting the cell death pathways toward apoptosis." ;

We examined TILs grades of pretreatment cancer tissue specimens and residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab and determined the predictive utility of the TILs grade in pathological complete response (pCR) and the prognostic power of TILs in HER2-positive breast cancer. This cohort study included 128 HER2-positive breast cancer who received NAC with trastuzumab. TILs grading of the tumor stroma in pretreatment biopsy specimens and residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab was categorized as low, intermediate, and high based on the criteria of the International Working Group. In current study, the pCR rate was 64.8%, and the Relapse-free survival (RFS) was significantly worse in the non-pCR group than in the pCR group. The pCR rate correlated with the TILs grade in pretreatment tumors. In 45 non-pCR patients, TILs grade was higher in the residual tumors than in the pretreatment tumors. The RFS was significantly better in residual tumors with high TILs grade than those with low TILs grade (p = 0.033). In conclusion, assessment of the TILs grade in residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab might be necessary to determine patients with good prognosis among those who do not achieve pCR. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

However, their clinical importance in gallbladder cancer has rarely been explored. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of surgical intervention and the effectiveness of preoperative test on neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) for predicting the prognosis in gallbladder cancer patients. In this study, a total of 255 gallbladder cancer patients were retrospectively selected. For each patient, we recorded his/her treatment algorithm (with or without surgery) and their preoperative inflammatory biomarkers, as well as their detailed survival information for 5 years. A total of 216 patients received surgical intervention and the other 39 chose conservative treatment. The median survival time was 4.6 months for non-surgical group (P < 0.001), and 12.2 months for surgical intervention group. Among the surgical group, ROC analysis showed the AUC of NLR, PLR and MLR were 0.675 (95% CI: 0.600 to 0.751, P < 0.001), 0.599 (95% CI: 0.520 to 0.677, P = 0.017) and 0.607 (95% CI: 0.529 to 0.686, P = 0.009), respectively.

        fabio:abstract    "Most targeting strategies of anticancer drug delivery systems (DDSs) rely on the surface functionalization of nanocarriers with specific ligands, which trigger the internalization in cancer cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The endocytosis implies the entrapment of DDSs in acidic vesicles (endosomes and lysosomes) and their eventual ejection by exocytosis. This process, intrinsic to eukaryotic cells, is one of the main drawbacks of DDSs because it reduces the drug bioavailability in the intracellular environment. The escape of DDSs from the acidic vesicles is, therefore, crucial to enhance the therapeutic performance at low drug dose. To this end, we developed a multifunctionalized DDS that combines high specificity towards cancer cells with endosomal escape capabilities. Doxorubicin-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles were functionalized with polyethylenimine, a polymer commonly used to induce endosomal rupture, and hyaluronic acid, which binds to CD44 receptors, overexpressed in cancer cells. We show irrefutable proof that the developed DDS can escape the endosomal pathway upon polymeric functionalization. Interestingly, the combination of the two polymers resulted in higher endosomal escape efficiency than the polyethylenimine coating alone. Hyaluronic acid additionally provides the system with cancer targeting capability and enzymatically controlled drug release. Thanks to this multifunctionality, the engineered DDS had cytotoxicity comparable to the pure drug whilst displaying high specificity towards cancer cells. The polymeric engineering here developed enhances the performance of DDS at low drug dose, holding great potential for anticancer therapeutic applications. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Using multiple aggressive murine models of triple-negative breast cancer, we have recently demonstrated that the early administration of oncolytic Maraba virus (MRB) prior to surgical resection of the primary tumor is sufficient to minimize the metastatic burden, protect against tumor rechallenge, cure a fraction of the mice and sensitize refractory tumors to immune checkpoint blockade without the need for further treatment. Here, we apply our surgical model to other OVs: Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Adenovirus (Ad), Reovirus (Reo) and Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and show that all of the tested OVs could positively change the outcome of the treated animals. The growth of the primary and secondary tumors was differently affected by the various OVs and most of the viruses conferred survival benefits in this neoadjuvant setting despite the absence of direct treatment following rechallenge.

Recent data indicate that p130Cas association to ErbB2 protects ErbB2 from degradation, thus enhancing tumorigenesis. Therefore, inhibiting p130Cas/ErbB2 interaction might represent a new therapeutic strategy to target breast cancer. Here we demonstrate by performing Molecular Modeling, Molecular Dynamics, dot blot, ELISA and fluorescence quenching experiments, that p130Cas binds directly to ErbB2. Then, by structure-based virtual screening, we identified two potential inhibitors of p130Cas/ErbB2 interaction. Their experimental validation was performed in vitro and in ErbB2-positive breast cancer cellular models. The results highlight that both compounds interfere with p130Cas/ErbB2 binding and significantly affect cell proliferation and sensitivity to Trastuzumab. Overall, this study identifies p130Cas/ErbB2 complex as a potential breast cancer target revealing new therapeutic perspectives for protein-protein interaction (PPI). © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

A large number of clinical applications have revealed that Trametes robiniophila Μurr. (Huaier) exhibits an anti-tumour effect. However, loss of the bioactive components of Huaier during the extraction procedure with water is unavoidable, and the underlying mechanism of the anti-cancer effect of Huaier remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer effect of Huaier n-butanol extract, which contained 51.4% total flavonoids, on HGC27, MGC803, and AGS human GC cell lines in vitro. At a low concentration, Huaier n-butanol extract inhibited the growth of these GC cell types, induced cell cycle arrest and reduced cell metastasis. Moreover, Huaier n-butanol extract suppressed the c-Myc-Bmi1 signalling pathway, and overexpression of Bmi1 reversed the effects of Huaier n-butanol extract on GC cells. Thus, our findings indicate that Huaier n-butanol extract suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of GC cells via a c-Myc-Bmi1-mediated approach, providing a new perspective for our understanding of the anti-tumour effects of Huaier. These results suggest that Huaier n-butanol extract could be an attractive therapeutic adjuvant for the treatment of human GC. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

In the present study, we screened the anticancer potential of supernatant metabolites from eight native haloarchaeal strains obtained from a culture collection in Iran. Five human cancer cell lines including breast, lung, prostate and also human fibroblast cells as the normal control were used in the present study. Moreover, to evaluate the anti-tumor effect of the selected supernatant, inhibition of sphere formation and tumor development was assessed in-vitro and in-vivo, respectively. Among all strains, supernatant metabolites from Halobacterium salinarum IBRC M10715 had the most potent cytotoxic effect on prostate cancer cell lines (IC50 = 0.5 mg/mL) without any effects on normal cells. It significantly increased both early and late apoptosis (about 11% and 9%, respectively) in the androgen-dependent PC3 cell line, reduced sphere formation ability of DU145 and PC3 cells with down-regulation of SOX2 gene expression. Furthermore, our results revealed that tumors developed in nude mice significantly shrank post intratumor injection of metabolites of the haloarchaeal strain. In conclusion, we suggested here for the first time that supernatant metabolites from Halobacterium salinarum IBRC M10715 could be a novel component against prostate cancer in-vitro and in-vivo with remarkable reduction in stem-like properties of tumor. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

The main HNSCC risk factors are tobacco, excessive alcohol use, and the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV positive (+) cancers are etiologically different from other HNSCC and often show better prognosis. The current knowledge regarding HNSCC miRNA profiles is still incomplete especially in the context of HPV+ cancer. Thus, we analyzed 61 freshly collected primary oral (OSCC) and oropharyngeal (OPSCC) SCC samples. HPV DNA and RNA was found in 21% cases. The Illumina whole-genome small-RNA profiling by next-generation sequencing was done on 22 samples and revealed 7 specific miRNAs to HPV+ OSCC, 77 to HPV+ OPSCC, and additional 3 shared with both; 51 miRNAs were specific to HPV− OPSCC, 62 to HPV− OSCC, and 31 shared with both. The results for 9 miRNAs (miR-9, -21, -29a, -100, -106b, -143 and -145) were assessed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction on the whole study population. The data was additionally confirmed by reanalyzing publicly available miRNA sequencing Cancer Genome Atlas consortium (TCGA) HNSCC data. Cell signaling pathway analysis revealed differences between HPV+ and HPV− HNSCC. Our findings compared with literature data revealed extensive heterogeneity of miRNA deregulation with only several miRNAs consistently affected, and miR-9 being the most likely HPV related miRNA. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Resistance to 5-Fluorouracil chemotherapy is a major cause of therapeutic failure in colon cancer cure. Development of combined therapies constitutes an effective strategy to inhibit cancer cells and prevent the emergence of drug resistance. For this purpose, we investigated the anti-tumoral effect of thirteen phenolic compounds, from the Tunisian quince Cydonia oblonga Miller, alone or combined to 5-FU, on the human 5-FU-resistant LS174-R colon cancer cells in comparison to parental cells. Our results showed that only Kaempferol was able to chemo-sensitize 5-FU-resistant LS174-R cells. This phenolic compound combined with 5-FU exerted synergistic inhibitory effect on cell viability. This combination enhanced the apoptosis and induced cell cycle arrest of both chemo-resistant and sensitive cells through impacting the expression levels of different cellular effectors. Kaempferol also blocked the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and modulated the expression of JAK/STAT3, MAPK, PI3K/AKT and NF-κB. In silico docking analysis suggested that the potent anti-tumoral effect of Kaempferol, compared to its two analogs (Kaempferol 3-O-glucoside and Kampferol 3-O-rutinoside), can be explained by the absence of glucosyl groups. Overall, our data propose Kaempferol as a potential chemotherapeutic agent to be used alone or in combination with 5-FU to overcome colon cancer drug resistance. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Considering the high prevalence and mortality rate of colorectal cancer, in this study we tried to design and validate a standard printed form and evaluate oncologists’ and nurses’ adherence to this form. This cross-sectional study was performed in Omid hospital, Mashhad, Iran from January 2015 to October 2015. A Chemotherapy form including various demographic and clinical parameters and approved chemotherapy regimens for colorectal cancer was designed by the clinical pharmacist and validated by clinical oncologists working in this center. All eligible patients admitted in this center during this period of time were included in the study. Adherence of the oncologists and nurses to this form and probable medication errors were identified by the pharmacy student. Sixty-seven patients with colorectal cancer and a total of 251 chemotherapy courses were evaluated. All patients received regimens compatible with developed form but in 206 courses (98.56%) of chemotherapy dosing error happened and in most of cases patients received lower than calculated dose (37.8%). Three errors occurred in administration step by nurses which they infused the medication in shorter than recommended duration. In general, oncologists’ adherence with developed form for chemotherapy of colorectal cancer was relatively high, except in dose calculation. Avoiding from rounding the calculated medications’ doses and precise calculation of patients’ body surface area can prevent most of medication errors and reduce risk of adverse drug reaction occurrence. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

Nevertheless, the importance of transfusion timing is still unclear. The primary purpose of this study is to appraise whether the receipt of intraoperative blood transfusion (BT) differ from postoperative BT in regards to cancer outcomes in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients treated with nephrectomy. Data on 1168 patients with RCC, who underwent radical or partial nephrectomy as primary therapy between 1988–2013 were analyzed. PBT was defined as transfusion of allogeneic red blood cells (RBC) during surgery or the postsurgical period. Survival was analyzed and compared using the Kaplan–Meier method with the log-rank test. Of 1168 patients, 198 patients (16.9%) received a PBT. Including 117 intraoperative BT and 81 postoperative BT. Only 21 (10.6%) patients required both intraoperative and postoperative BT. On multivariate analyses, receipt of PBT was associated with significantly worse local disease recurrence (HR: 2.4; P = 0.017), metastatic progression (HR: 2.7; P = 0.005), cancer-specific mortality (HR: 3.5; P = 0.002) and all-cause mortality (HR: 2.1; P = 0.005). Nevertheless, postoperative BT was not independently associated with increased risk of local recurrence (p = 0.1), metastatic progression (P = 0.16) or kidney cancer death (P = 0.63), yet did significantly increase the risk of overall mortality (HR: 2.6; P = 0.004). In the current study, intraoperative transfusion of allogeneic RBC is associated with increased risks of cancer recurrence and mortality following nephrectomy. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

For this reason novel therapies accounting for PDAC peculiarities, such as the relevant stromal reaction, are urgently needed. Here adipose mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (AD-MSC) have been armed to constantly release a soluble trimeric and multimeric variant of the known anti-cancer TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (sTRAIL). This cancer gene therapy strategy was in vitro challenged demonstrating that sTRAIL was thermally stable and able to induce apoptosis in the PDAC lines BxPC-3, MIA PaCa-2 and against primary PDAC cells. sTRAIL released by AD-MSC relocated into the tumor stroma was able to significantly counteract tumor growth in vivo with a significant reduction in tumor size, in cytokeratin-7+ cells and by an anti-angiogenic effect. In parallel, histology on PDAC specimens form patients (n = 19) was performed to investigate the levels of TRAIL DR4, DR5 and OPG receptors generating promising insights on the possible clinical translation of our approach. These results indicate that adipose MSC can very efficiently vehicle a novel TRAIL variant opening unexplored opportunities for PDAC treatment. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Therefore, identification of novel therapeutic targets involved in melanoma progression is urgently needed for developing effective therapeutic methods. Overexpression of interleukin-13 receptor α2 (IL13Rα2) is observed in several cancer types including glioma and pancreatic cancer. Although IL13Rα2 is implicated in the progression of various types of cancer, its expression and roles in the malignant melanoma have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we showed that IL13Rα2 was expressed in approximately 7.5% melanoma patients. While IL13Rα2 expression in human melanoma cells decreased their proliferation in vitro, it promoted in vivo tumour growth and angiogenesis in melanoma xenograft mouse model. We also found that the expression of amphiregulin, a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, was correlated with IL13Rα2 expression in cultured melanoma cells, xenograft tumour tissues and melanoma clinical samples. Furthermore, expression of amphiregulin promoted tumour growth, implicating causal relationship between the expression of IL13Rα2 and amphiregulin. These results suggest that IL13Rα2 enhances tumorigenicity by inducing angiogenesis in malignant melanoma, and serves as a potential therapeutic target of malignant melanoma. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Experiment in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines demonstrated up-regulation of PKD2 led to high expression of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vim, mmp9 et al.) and EMT transcription factors(zeb1, twist, snail), and the results were reversed when PKD2 was knocked down. Further investigation showed that abrogation of PKD2 inhibited A549 cell migration, invasion, proliferation and induced cell arrest in G2/M phase.

We showed for the first time that Raman imaging can be used to distinguish successfully between glycosylated and nonglycosylated proteins in normal and cancer tissue. Thousands of protein, lipid and glycan species exist in cells and tissues and their metabolism is monitored via numerous pathways, networks and methods. The metabolism can change in response to cellular environment alterations, such as development of a disease. Measuring such alterations and understanding the pathways involved are crucial to fully understand cellular metabolism in cancer development. In this paper Raman markers of glycogen, glycosaminoglycan, chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate proteoglycan were identified based on their vibrational signatures. High spatial resolution of Raman imaging combined with chemometrics allows separation of individual species from many chemical components present in each cell. We have found that metabolism of proteins, lipids and glycans is markedly deregulated in breast (adenocarcinoma) and brain (medulloblastoma) tumors. We have identified two glycoforms in the normal breast tissue and the malignant brain tissue in contrast to the breast cancer tissue where only one glycoform has been identified. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate anti-cancer effects of NLC-Citral in MDA MB-231 cells in vitro through the Annexin V, cell cycle, JC-1 and fluorometric assays. Additionally, this study is aimed to effects of NLC-Citral in reducing the tumor weight and size in 4T1 induced murine breast cancer model. Results showed that NLC-Citral induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest in MDA MB-231 cells. Furthermore, a prominent anti-metastatic ability of NLC-Citral was demonstrated in vitro using scratch, migration and invasion assays. A significant reduction of migrated and invaded cells was observed in the NLC-Citral treated MDA MB-231 cells. To further evaluate the apoptotic and anti-metastatic mechanism of NLC-Citral at the molecular level, microarray-based gene expression and proteomic profiling were conducted. Based on the result obtained, NLC-Citral was found to regulate several important signaling pathways related to cancer development such as apoptosis, cell cycle, and metastasis signaling pathways. Additionally, gene expression analysis was validated through the targeted RNA sequencing and real-time polymerase chain reaction. In conclusion, the NLC-Citral inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells in vitro, majorly through the induction of apoptosis, anti-metastasis, anti-angiogenesis potentials, and reducing the tumor weight and size without altering the therapeutic effects of citral. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The incidence of developing cancer should increase with the body mass, yet is not the case, a conundrum referred to as Peto’s paradox. Elephants have a lower incidence of cancer suggesting that these animals have probably evolved different ways to protect themselves against the disease. The paradox is worth revisiting with the realization that most mammals encode an endogenous APOBEC3 cytidine deaminase capable of mutating single stranded DNA. Indeed, the mutagenic activity of some APOBEC3 enzymes has been shown to introduce somatic mutations into genomic DNA. These enzymes are now recognized as causal agent responsible for the accumulation of CG- > TA transitions and DNA breaks leading to chromosomal rearrangements in human cancer genomes. Here, we identified an elephant A3Z1 gene, related to human APOBEC3A and showed that it could efficiently deaminate cytidine, 5-methylcytidine and produce DNA breaks leading to massive apoptosis, similar to other mammalian APOBEC3A enzymes where body mass varies by up to four orders of magnitude. Consequently, it could be considered that eAZ1 might contribute to cancer in elephants in a manner similar to their proposed role in humans. If so, eAZ1 might be particularly well regulated to counter Peto’s paradox. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Despite recent improvements in treatment, ovarian cancer is still the leading cause of death from gynaecological malignancies. Today, marine mollusks are considered as natural source of new biologically and pharmacologically active compounds by scientists and the pharmaceutical industries. The aim of this study is to investigate the selective apoptotic effects of Turbo coronatus crude extract fractions on human epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells and mitochondria. The cells and mitochondria were isolated from cancerous and non-cancerous ovarian tissues and exposed to IC 50 concentration of F1 fraction for evaluation of mitochondrial and cellular parameters. Our results showed that F1 fraction of T. coronatus crude extract significantly induced toxic effects only in the cancerous ovarian mitochondria, including increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, mitochondrial swelling, and cytochrome c release.Flow-cytometry analysis demonstrated that F1 fraction of T. coronatus progressively induced apoptosis and necrosis only on EOC but not non-cancerous cells. We eventuallyconcluded that F1 fraction of T. coronatus crude extract selectively induces apoptosis in EOC through a ROS-mediated pathway. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

        fabio:abstract     "Artemisinin is used as an antimalarial and anticancer agent with minimal toxic effects on the host body. Biotin-PEG-PCL polymers have been used for targeted drug delivery to cancer, as well as to improve the pharmacokinetics of the drug and reduce its effects. In this study, biotin-conjugated copolymers were fabricated with polymerization of the ring opening method and the properties of copolymer and nanoparticles were investigated using various techniques. The toxicity of artemisinin and its nanoparticles have been investigated on MCF-7 and normal HFF2 cells. The results showed that the encapsulation efficacy of artemisinin in nanoparticles was 45.5 ± 0.41%. The release profile of the drug indicates that the release is slow and controlled and is approximately pH dependent. The results of artemisinin cell culture on human breast cancer cells showed that biotin-PEG-PCL nanoparticles had an inhibitory effect on MCF-7 cells and had no toxic effects on HFF2 cells. Anticancer activity in vivo in the 4T1 breast cancer model showed that tumour volumes were decreased up 40 mm3 by ART-loaded micelles and 76 mm3 by free ART, compared to the control group (2150 mm). In vivo results showed that this formulation significantly increases the accumulation of substances in the tumours. Therefore, the molecular formulation of ART-based copolymers can be a desirable process for cancer treatment purposes. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group." ;

It has been estimated that there are about 2 billion people with a serological profile of HBV infection, and 360 million patients worldwide living with chronic HBV-associated liver disease, hence the need to find an efficient and precise diagnosis technique to drive a robust treatment for Hepatitis B virus cannot be over emphasized. The emergence of analytical device like biosensor which combines biological and physicochemical element to detect HBV in screened samples has been very helpful in providing a timely intervention to tame this virus.

        fabio:abstract    "n-Butylidenephthalide (BP) is a potential anti-cancer drug, which can be extracted from Angelica sinensis (Danggui). Previous reports have shown the effectiveness of BP in treating cancer diseases. However, BP has no targeting capacity towards specific cancer cells. To improve treatment efficiency and reduce the dose of BP used in cancer treatment, targeting-based approaches should be developed. In the present study, we used riboflavin-5′-phosphate (RFMP) immobilized iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4 MNPs) as carriers for BP to treat cancer cell lines derived from liver, prostate and breast. These model cancer cells overexpress riboflavin receptors on their cell membrane and are also sensitive to BP treatment. Thus, BP-binding free RFMP on MNPs can be used as probes to target these model cells, whereas BP can be readily released on target cancer cells. Cell viability was twofold lower by using Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs immobilized with BP than that achieved by using free-form BP at a similar amount. Moreover, BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs have no apparent harmful effects on non-target cells. In addition, we evaluated the level of cysteine-aspartic acid protease 3 (caspase 3) in the resultant cell lysate obtained after treatment by BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs to demonstrate that apoptosis is mainly involved in the growth inhibition of target cells. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

The aim of this national population-based retrospective study was to analyze the relationship between MetS and the incidence of laryngeal cancer. Patients with laryngeal cancer (ICD-10: C32) between 2009 and 2010 were retrospectively identified and tracked until 2015 using the Korean Health Insurance claims database. During the seven-year follow-up period, 5,322 subjects were newly diagnosed with larynx cancer. The mean age of people with laryngeal cancer was much higher than those without (63.29 vs. 47.7 years, p < 0.0001), and the incidence of larynx cancer in men was much higher than that in women (93.16% vs. 6.84%, p < 0.0001). Age, gender, smoking status, alcohol intake, and exercise-adjusted hazard ratios indicated that participants with MetS had a 1.13-fold higher hazard of having larynx cancer than those without MetS. The number of MetS components was a strong risk factor for laryngeal cancer with a higher risk estimate of this cancer in both ex- and current smokers as well as people who have never smoked. MetS was found to be an independent risk factor for the incidence of laryngeal cancer. In Korea, MetS and its components are significantly associated with the development of laryngeal cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

In this study, we demonstrated that FLOT2 expression levels were greatly upregulated in glioma tissues and cell lines, and the FLOT2 expression in glioma tissue was markedly associated with tumour stage and size. Overexpression of FLOT2 was correlated with poor prognosis of glioma patients. The functional assay revealed that silenced FLOT2 repressed the viability, migration, and invasion of glioma cells. And then, we detected the relationship between miR-449 and FLOT2. Luciferase reporter assay and Western blot results showed that miR-449 directly binding the 3′UTR sequence of FLOT2 and regulated FLOT2 expression in glioma cells. Finally, we detected the expression levels of miR-449 in glioma tissue and cell lines and found that miR-449 was significantly downregulated in glioma tissues and cell lines. In conclusion, we demonstrated that overexpression FLOT2 was associated with poor prognosis of glioma patients and involved in the progression of glioma, identifying a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for glioma progression. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group." ;

One of the consequences of chromosomal rearrangement is gene fusions in the cancer genome. We have previously identified a panel of fusion genes in aggressive prostate cancers. In this study, we showed that 6 of these fusion genes are present in 7 different types of human malignancies with variable frequencies. Among them, the CCNH-C5orf30 and TRMT11-GRIK2 gene fusions were found in breast cancer, colon cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, ovarian cancer and liver cancer, with frequencies ranging from 12.9% to 85%. In contrast, four other gene fusions (mTOR-TP53BP1, TMEM135-CCDC67, KDM4-AC011523.2 and LRRC59-FLJ60017) are less frequent. Both TRMT11-GRIK2 and CCNH-C5orf30 are also frequently present in lymph node metastatic cancer samples from the breast, colon and ovary. Thus, detecting these fusion transcripts may have significant biological and clinical implications in cancer patient management. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Quantifying the genetic correlation between cancers can provide important insights into the mechanisms driving cancer etiology. Using genome-wide association study summary statistics across six cancer types based on a total of 296,215 cases and 301,319 controls of European ancestry, here we estimate the pair-wise genetic correlations between breast, colorectal, head/neck, lung, ovary and prostate cancer, and between cancers and 38 other diseases. We observed statistically significant genetic correlations between lung and head/neck cancer (r g = 0.57, p = 4.6 × 10 −8 ), breast and ovarian cancer (r g = 0.24, p = 7 × 10 −5 ), breast and lung cancer (r g = 0.18, p =1.5 × 10 −6 ) and breast and colorectal cancer (r g = 0.15, p = 1.1 × 10 −4 ). We also found that multiple cancers are genetically correlated with non-cancer traits including smoking, psychiatric diseases and metabolic characteristics. Functional enrichment analysis revealed a significant excess contribution of conserved and regulatory regions to cancer heritability. Our comprehensive analysis of cross-cancer heritability suggests that solid tumors arising across tissues share in part a common germline genetic basis. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Purpose: Several previous studies have shown that oral bisphosphonates (BPs) are associated with the incidence of 13 specific cancers, including lung cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the findings are heterogeneous. Methods and results: Relevant studies published in databases such as PubMed, Embase database, and Cochrane library were systematically retrieved from inception to August 25th, 2018, regardless of language, by two investigators independently. Afterwards, the maximum adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted from the retrieved studies. Finally, 13 cohort studies involving 1,510,763 participants were enrolled into this meta-analysis. No significant relationship was found between oral BPs and the risk of all-cause cancer in osteoporosis (OP) patients among the entire population (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80–1.18; I 2 92.5%). Besides, oral BPs could remarkably reduce the incidence of breast cancer (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68–0.92; I 2 54%) and endometrial cancer (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64–0.96; I 2 0%) in postmenopausal OP females. In addition, oral BPs were also found to evidently reduce the incidence of upper gastrointestinal cancer in OP patients among the entire population (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54–0.98; I 2 36.1%). However, oral BPs may lead to increased risk of liver cancer in mixed genders (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.03–2.77; I 2 30.7%). Conclusions: Taken together, oral BPs do not increase the risk of incidence of all-cause cancer; instead, they can reduce the incidence of breast, endometrial, and upper gastrointestinal cancers among the postmenopausal OP females. Our analysis stratified by gender suggests that oral BPs may increase the incidence of liver cancer in mixed genders, while no significant association was observed in females. Careful analysis of post-marketing data should be conducted to address the clinical relevance of our results on the putative association of oral BP use and liver cancer suggested by our meta-analysis. © 2018, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play critical roles in the tumor progression. However, it remains unclear how cancer cells migrate in the three-dimensional (3D) matrix of cancer tissues and how CAFs support the cancer invasion. Here we propose a novel mechanism of fibroblast-dependent cancer cell invasion in the 3D collagen matrix. Human cancer cell lines from the pancreas (Panc-1), lung (A549) and some other organs actively adhered to normal fibroblasts and primary lung CAFs in cultures. To show its significance in tumor invasion, we designed a new invasion assay in which homogeneous microspheroids consisting of cancer cells and fibroblasts were embedded into collagen gel. Time-lapse experiments showed that cancer cells adhered to and quickly migrated on the long protrusions of fibroblasts in the 3D collagen matrix. Fibroblast-free cancer cells poorly invaded the matrix. Experiments with function-blocking antibodies, siRNAs, and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that cancer cells adhered to fibroblasts through integrin α5β1-mediated binding to fibronectin on the surface of fibroblasts. Immunochemical analyses of the co-cultures and lung cancers suggested that cancer cells could acquire the migratory force by the fibronectin/integrin signaling. Our results also revealed that the fibroblast-bound fibronectin was a preferential substrate for cancer cells to migrate in the collagen matrix. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The prognosis of pancreatic cancer remains dismal despite continuous and considerable efforts. Integrins (ITGs) are highly expressed in various malignant cancers. However, very few studies investigated the role of integrin α3 (ITGα3) in malignant cancers. Here, we determined the functional role of ITGα3 in pancreatic cancer. Analysis of public microarray databases and Western blot analysis indicated a unique expression of ITGα3 in human pancreatic cancer. Silencing ITGα3 expression significantly inhibited the viability and migration of human pancreatic cancer cells. Notably, ablation of ITGα3 expression resulted in a significant decrease of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression compared with transfection of control-siRNA through an increased number of leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domain protein 1 (LRIG1) expression. In addition, ablating ITGα3 inhibited tumour growth via blockade of EGFR signalling in vivo. Furthermore, the highly expressed ITGα3 led to a poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. Our results provide novel insights into ITGα3-induced aggressive pancreatic cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Breast cancer metastasis accounts for most of the deaths from breast cancer. Since epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in promoting metastasis of cancer, many mechanisms regarding EMT have been studied. We previously showed that Ribonucleic acid export 1 (RAE1) is dysregulated in breast cancer and its overexpression leads to aggressive breast cancer phenotypes by inducing EMT. Here, we evaluated the functional capacity of RAE1 in breast cancer metastasis by using a three-dimensional (3D) culture system and xenograft models. Furthermore, to investigate the mechanisms of RAE1-driven EMT, in vitro studies were carried out. The induction of EMT with RAE1-overexpression was confirmed under the 3D culture system and in vivo system. Importantly, RAE1 mediates upregulation of an EMT marker ZEB1, by binding to the promoter region of ZEB1. Knockdown of ZEB1 in RAE1-overexpressing cells suppressed invasive and migratory behaviors, accompanied by an increase in epithelial and a decrease in mesenchymal markers. Taken together, these data demonstrate that RAE1 contributes to breast cancer metastasis by regulating a key EMT-inducing factor ZEB1 expression, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Obesity is a risk factor for many cancers including breast, esophageal, colon, and thyroid cancer. We aimed to evaluate the association of thyroid cancer with body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and weight change. This nationwide population-based cohort study included 11,323,006 adults who joined the national health screening program. Weight change was defined as the difference between the weight of the subjects measured during the study period and the weight at the time of four years ago. For evaluating the association between the weight change and the risk of thyroid cancer, subjects without weight change for four years were defined as the reference group. Mean age was 50.1 ± 13.7 years and 44% were female. In total, 50,464 subjects (0.4%) had newly-diagnosed thyroid cancer. After multivariable analyses, the incidence of thyroid cancer increased significantly in subjects with larger WC as well as higher BMI (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). In subjects who were lean and became obese, the incidence of thyroid cancers increased significantly (hazard ratio [HR] 1.15 [1.11–1.19]). In subjects who were obese and became lean, the incidence of thyroid cancers decreased significantly (HR 0.89 [0.86–0.93]). These results demonstrated that higher BMI and larger WC were significantly associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer. Weight gain in lean subjects was associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer, and weight reduction in subjects with obesity was associated with a decreased risk of thyroid cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) has increased among Norwegian women, and is among the highest in the world. In order to understand this increase, country specific dietary exposures have been investigated. The aim of this study was to quantify the association between consumption of brown cheese, a common bread topping in Norway, and colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer in the prospective Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) Study. Data on brown cheese consumption and adjustment factors was available for 82 527 women. During a mean of 14.6 years of follow-up (1.2 million person-years), there were 1360 cases of colorectal cancer (907 colon; 453 rectal). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer sites. We modelled restricted cubic splines with 4 knots, to assess a possible non-linear relationship between brown cheese intake and the investigated cancer sites. In the age-adjusted model, consumption of more than 2 slices (>16 grams) of brown cheese per day was associated with 13% reduced risk of colon cancer (95% CI 4%-21%) compared to women who did not consume brown cheese. The multivariable-adjusted model, however, showed no association between brown cheese consumption and the risk of colorectal, colon, or rectal cancer (colorectal: HR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.76–1.13, p-trend 0.37; colon: HR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.65–1.06; p-trend = 0.10; rectal: HR = 1.16, 95% CI 0.84–1.1.61, p-trend = 0.41). In this large, prospective cohort study of women, consumption of brown cheese was suggestively protective against colon cancer. However, adjustment attenuated the inverse risk association. Brown cheese consumption was not associated with rectal cancer, or colorectal cancer overall. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Current cancer diagnosis utilizes histopathology, which requires tissue acquisition, extensive processing and, in most cases, relies on the qualitative morphological analysis of tissues and cells. Molecular biomarkers are only available for a few specific tumor subtypes. We discovered that the fluorescence polarization (Fpol) of Methylene Blue (MB) is significantly higher in cancer than in normal human breast tissues and cells. We confirmed that fluorescence polarization imaging did not affect the viability of the cells and yielded highly significant differences between cancer and normal cells using MB concentrations as low as 0.05 and 0.01 mg/ml. To explain this phenomenon we examined intracellular localization of MB and its fluorescence lifetime. We determined that higher fluorescence polarization of MB occurs due to its increased accumulation in mitochondria of cancer cells, as well as shorter fluorescence lifetime in cancer relative to normal cells. As quantitative MB Fpol imaging can be performed in vivo and in real time, it holds the potential to provide an accurate quantitative marker of cancer at the cellular level. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

However, the specific combinations of mutations responsible for the vast majority of cancers have not been identified. Current computational approaches focus on identifying driver genes and mutations. Although individually these mutations can increase the risk of cancer they do not result in cancer without additional mutations. We present a fundamentally different approach for identifying the cause of individual instances of cancer: we search for combinations of genes with carcinogenic mutations (multi-hit combinations) instead of individual driver genes or mutations. We developed an algorithm that identified a set of multi-hit combinations that differentiate between tumor and normal tissue samples with 91% sensitivity (95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 89–92%) and 93% specificity (95% CI = 91–94%) on average for seventeen cancer types. We then present an approach based on mutational profile that can be used to distinguish between driver and passenger mutations within these genes. These combinations, with experimental validation, can aid in better diagnosis, provide insights into the etiology of cancer, and provide a rational basis for designing targeted combination therapies. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

We developed a novel computational platform applying a multi-modal approach to filter out passengers and more robustly identify putative driver genes. The primary filter identifies enrichment of cancer mutations in CATH functional families (CATH-FunFams) – structurally and functionally coherent sets of evolutionary related domains. Using structural representatives from CATH-FunFams, we subsequently seek enrichment of mutations in 3D and show that these mutation clusters have a very significant tendency to lie close to known functional sites or conserved sites predicted using CATH-FunFams. Our third filter identifies enrichment of putative driver genes in functionally coherent protein network modules confirmed by literature analysis to be cancer associated. Our approach is complementary to other domain enrichment approaches exploiting Pfam families, but benefits from more functionally coherent groupings of domains. Using a set of mutations from 22 cancers we detect 151 putative cancer drivers, of which 79 are not listed in cancer resources and include recently validated cancer associated genes EPHA7, DCC netrin-1 receptor and zinc-finger protein ZNF479. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Collectively, 86.3% (63/73) of HAMPs have recurrent alterations in at least 1 cancer type and 16 HAMPs, including 9 understudied HAMPs, are identified as putative therapeutic targets across multiple cancer types. For example, the recurrent focal amplification of BRD9 is observed in 9 cancer types and genetic depletion of BRD9 inhibits tumor growth.

        fabio:abstract    "The current system for evaluating prostate cancer architecture is the Gleason grading system which divides the morphology of cancer into five distinct architectural patterns, labeled 1 to 5 in increasing levels of cancer aggressiveness, and generates a score by summing the labels of the two most dominant patterns. The Gleason score is currently the most powerful prognostic predictor of patient outcomes; however, it suffers from problems in reproducibility and consistency due to the high intra-observer and inter-observer variability amongst pathologists. In addition, the Gleason system lacks the granularity to address potentially prognostic architectural features beyond Gleason patterns. We evaluate prostate cancer for architectural subtypes using techniques from topological data analysis applied to prostate cancer glandular architecture. In this work we demonstrate the use of persistent homology to capture architectural features independently of Gleason patterns. Specifically, using persistent homology, we compute topological representations of purely graded prostate cancer histopathology images of Gleason patterns 3,4 and 5, and show that persistent homology is capable of clustering prostate cancer histology into architectural groups through a ranked persistence vector. Our results indicate the ability of persistent homology to cluster prostate cancer histopathology images into unique groups with dominant architectural patterns consistent with the continuum of Gleason patterns. In addition, of particular interest, is the sensitivity of persistent homology to identify specific sub-architectural groups within single Gleason patterns, suggesting that persistent homology could represent a robust quantification method for prostate cancer architecture with higher granularity than the existing semi-quantitative measures. The capability of these topological representations to segregate prostate cancer by architecture makes them an ideal candidate for use as inputs to future machine learning approaches with the intent of augmenting traditional approaches with topological features for improved diagnosis and prognosis. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Among 8,651,569 cancer patients, 13,311 committed suicide; the rate of suicide was 28.58/ 100,000-person years, and the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of suicide was 4.44 (95% CI, 4.33, 4.55). The predominant patients who committed suicide were male (83%) and white (92%). Cancers of the lung, head and neck, testes, bladder, and Hodgkin lymphoma had the highest SMRs (> 5-10) through the follow up period. Elderly, white, unmarried males with localized disease are at highest risk vs other cancer patients. Among those diagnosed at < 50 years of age, the plurality of suicides is from hematologic and testicular tumors; if > 50, from prostate, lung, and colorectal cancer patients. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

However, the specific combinations of mutations responsible for the vast majority of cancers have not been identified. Current computational approaches focus on identifying driver genes and mutations. Although individually these mutations can increase the risk of cancer they do not result in cancer without additional mutations. We present a fundamentally different approach for identifying the cause of individual instances of cancer: we search for combinations of genes with carcinogenic mutations (multi-hit combinations) instead of individual driver genes or mutations. We developed an algorithm that identified a set of multi-hit combinations that differentiate between tumor and normal tissue samples with 91% sensitivity (95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 89–92%) and 93% specificity (95% CI = 91–94%) on average for seventeen cancer types. We then present an approach based on mutational profile that can be used to distinguish between driver and passenger mutations within these genes. These combinations, with experimental validation, can aid in better diagnosis, provide insights into the etiology of cancer, and provide a rational basis for designing targeted combination therapies. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The UHRF1-DNMT1 axis plays a key role in DNA maintenance methylation in mammals. Accumulative studies demonstrate that UHRF1 is broadly overexpressed in cancers, which contributes to cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Interestingly, a proteasome-dependent downregulation of UHRF1 has been observed in pluripotent ground state mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) cultured in the presence of two kinase (MEK1/MEK2 and GSK3β) inhibitors (termed 2i), raising the question whether UHRF1 is similarly regulated in cancer cells. Here we present evidence that while addition of 2i broadly downregulates UHRF1 and DNMT1 in various cancer cells, distinct underlying mechanisms are involved. In contrast to mESCs, 2i-induced downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in cancer cells cannot be rescued by proteasome inhibitor and occurs primarily at the level of transcription. Furthermore, downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 by 2i is due to inhibition of MEK1/MEK2, but not GSK3β activity. Data mining reveals a marked co-expression of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in normal tissues as well as cancers. We provide evidence that multiple transcription factors including E2F1 and SP1 mediate the transcriptional activation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 by the activated MEK/ERK pathway. Together our study reveals distinct regulation of UHRF1/DNMT1 in mESCs and cancer cells and identifies activated MEK/ERK pathway as a driving force for coordinated and aberrant over-expression of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in cancers. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

When it is applied to cancer cells, solid stress hinders their proliferation rate and promotes cancer cell invasion and metastatic potential. However, the underlying mechanisms of how it is implicated in cancer metastasis is not yet fully understood. Here, we used two pancreatic cancer cell lines and an established in vitro system to study the effect of solid stress-induced signal transduction on pancreatic cancer cell migration as well as the mechanism involved. Our results show that the migratory ability of cells increases as a direct response to solid stress. We also found that Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) expression and secretion is strongly upregulated in pancreatic cancer cells in response to mechanical compression. Performing a phosphoprotein screening, we identified that solid stress activates the Akt/CREB1 pathway to transcriptionally regulate GDF15 expression, which eventually promotes pancreatic cancer cell migration. Our results suggest a novel solid stress signal transduction mechanism bringing GDF15 to the centre of pancreatic tumor biology and rendering it a potential target for future anti-metastatic therapeutic innovations. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a cancer treatment that make use of the cancer-specific accumulation of porphyrins. We have reported that mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mitROS) upregulate uptake transporter of porphyrins, heme carrier protein-1 (HCP-1). The accumulation of cancer-specific porphyrins was increased by mitROS production, thereby the cancer-specific PDT cytotoxicity was enhanced. Thus we investigated whether mitROS production by hyperthermia can enhanced the cytotoxicity of PDT or not. In this study, 1 h of hyperthermia at 42 °C increased the mitROS production, and both the accumulation of cancer-specific porphyrins and the PDT cytotoxicity increased. Moreover, the authors treated cells with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) to examine the effect of mitROS. NAC inhibited the increasing ROS production after hyperthermia to restrain the post-treatment increase of cancer-specific porphyrins accumulation. Moreover, the increase of ROS production in cancer cells after hyperthermia upregulated HCP-1 expression and downregulated ABCG2 expression. These regulation were inhibited by NAC. These results suggest that hyperthermia treatment increased mitROS production, which involved HpD accumulation and enhanced PDT effects in cancer cells. The mechanism of this phenomenon was most likely to be due to both the upregulation of HCP-1 and the downregulation of ABCG2 by mitROS. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

In this study, we assessed the relationship between breast cancer and cadaverine biosynthesis. Cadaverine treatment of Balb/c female mice (500 nmol/kg p.o. q.d.) grafted with 4T1 breast cancer cells ameliorated the disease (lower mass and infiltration of the primary tumor, fewer metastases, and lower grade tumors). Cadaverine treatment of breast cancer cell lines corresponding to its serum reference range (100–800 nM) reverted endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, inhibited cellular movement and invasion, moreover, rendered cells less stem cell-like through reducing mitochondrial oxidation. Trace amino acid receptors (TAARs), namely, TAAR1, TAAR8 and TAAR9 were instrumental in provoking the cadaverine-evoked effects. Early stage breast cancer patients, versus control women, had reduced abundance of the CadA and LdcC genes in fecal DNA, both responsible for bacterial cadaverine production. Moreover, we found low protein expression of E. coli LdcC in the feces of stage 1 breast cancer patients. In addition, higher expression of lysine decarboxylase resulted in a prolonged survival among early-stage breast cancer patients. Taken together, cadaverine production seems to be a regulator of early breast cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Exogenous overexpression of CBX6 inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation, and induced cell cycle arrest along with suppression of migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro. Microarray analyses revealed that CBX6 governs a complex gene expression program. Moreover, CBX6 induced significant downregulation of bone marrow stromal cell antigen-2 (BST2), a potential therapeutic target, via interactions with its promoter region.

        fabio:abstract    "MRI plays important roles in endometrial and cervical cancer assessment, from detection to recurrent disease evaluation. Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common malignant tumor of the female genital tract in Western countries. EC patients are divided into risk categories based on histopathological tumor type, grade, and myometrial invasion depth. EC is surgically staged using the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) system. Since FIGO (2009) stage correlates with prognosis, preoperative staging is essential for tailored treatment. MRI reveals myometrial invasion depth, which correlates with tumor grade and lymph node metastases, and thus correlates with prognosis. Cervical cancer (CC) is the second most common cancer, and the third leading cause of cancer-related death among females in developing countries. The FIGO Gynecologic Oncology Committee recently revised its CC staging guidelines, allowing staging based on imaging and pathological findings when available. The revised FIGO (2018) staging includes node involvement and thus enables both therapy selection and evaluation, prognosis estimation, and calculation of end results. MRI can accurately assess prognostic indicators, e.g., tumor size, parametrial invasion, pelvic sidewall, and lymph node invasion. Despite these important roles of MRI, radiologists still face challenges due to the technical and interpretation pitfalls of MRI during all phases of endometrial and cervical cancer evaluation. Awareness of mimics that can simulate both cancers is critical. With careful application, functional MRI with DWI and DCE sequences can help establish a correct diagnosis, although it is sometimes necessary to perform biopsy and histopathological analysis. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Our observations were confirmed in a large variety of solid and haematological malignancies. This test was able to detect dysplasia and carcinomas in situ lesions in different organs and circulating factors in cancer patients years after the removal of their lesions. To our knowledge, this ability is unique and not shared by other liquid biopsy platforms. Immunohistochemistry analysis of the xenotransplants revealed identical patterns of differentiation regardless of the cancer type, showing that differentiation through horizontal transfer might be dependent on the nature of the target cells rather than the type of cancer factors.

Various studies have shown the significance of identifying drug targets for cancer, although this process continues challenging in the field of anti-cancer drug designing. The primary purpose of this study is to design a novel approach to identify target genes for cancer. The sub-network of colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancers were constructed from human protein–protein interaction network. The potential genes were analyzed using hubs and centrality measures. For the identification of target genes, we retrieve those genes that had the highest score in both mutation rates and graph centrality. Moreover, gene deletion analysis revealed that MYC, TP53, and EGFR genes remained potential targets in colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancer respectively. Results suggest that combining network measures with mutation frequencies in cancer genes might assist in recognizing several potential drug targets. Future enhancement of this current approach is to combine these network properties with the biological insights from gene expression data, and their functions will provide a reliable method for rational drug designing. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature." ;

As extracellular matrix, glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) could bind its surface receptor adhesion molecule CD44 which is strongly expressed on breast cancer. We have previously reported a doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded HA-Lys-LA X-NPs (X-NP-DOX) NP delivery system for breast cancer treatment. In this study, we further investigated the antitumor effect of X-NP-DOX NP delivery system using low-dose DOX in both in vitro and in vivo systems. We demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX possessed the ability for inhibiting MCF-7 breast cancer cell growth, invasion, and migration, and inducing apoptosis in vitro. In in vivo experiments, injection of low-dose X-NP-DOX into tumor-bearing mouse resulted in significant reduction of tumor size. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining further revealed that low-dose X-NP-DOX induced higher percentage of apoptotic cells compared with free DOX or saline. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX inhibited Notch1 and Ras/MAPK pathways, decreased cancer stem cell population, and reduced tumorigenesis compared to free DOX in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Owing to its enhanced efficacy and higher targetability compared to free DOX, low-dose DOX delivered by NP system may be a promising novel strategy for breast cancer treatment." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Breast cancer survivors display altered inflammatory responses to immune challenges relative to cancer-naive controls likely due to previous cancer treatments, stress associated with cancer, and/or tumor physiology. Proper inflammatory responses are necessary for adaptive sickness behaviors (e.g., fatigue, anorexia, and fever) and neuroinflammatory pathways are also implicated in mental health disturbances (e.g., cognitive impairment, depression) suffered by cancer patients and survivors. Rodent cancer models indicate that tumors are sufficient to exacerbate neuroinflammatory responses after an immune challenge, however primary tumors are not usually present in cancer survivors, and the behavioral consequences of these brain changes remain understudied. Therefore, we tested the extent to which mammary tumor resection attenuates tumor-induced neuroinflammation and sickness behavior following an immune challenge (i.p. lipopolysaccharide [LPS] injection) in mice. Tnf-α, Il-1β, and Il-6 mRNA decreased in multiple brain regions of LPS-treated tumor-bearing mice relative to LPS-treated controls; tumor resection attenuated these effects in some cases (but not Tnf-α). Tumors also attenuated sickness behaviors (hypothermia and lethargy) compared to LPS-treated controls. Tumor resection reversed these behavioral consequences, although basal body temperature remained elevated, comparable to tumor-bearing mice. Thus, tumors significantly modulate neuroinflammatory pathways with functional consequences and tumor resection mitigates most, but not all, of these changes. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Although substantial advances have been obtained both in treatment and survival rates, there is still a need for new therapeutical approaches. Natural compounds are a realistic source of new bioactive compounds with anticancer activity. Among them, rosemary polyphenols have shown a vast antiproliferative capacity against colon cancer cells in vitro and in animal models. We have investigated the antitumor activity of a rosemary extract (RE) obtained by using supercritical fluid extraction through its capacity to inhibit various signatures of cancer progression and metastasis such as proliferation, migration, invasion and clonogenic survival. RE strongly inhibited proliferation, migration and colony formation of colon cancer cells regardless their phenotype. Treatment with RE led to a sharp increase of intracellular ROS that resulted in necrosis cell death. Nrf2 gene silencing increased RE cytotoxic effects, thus suggesting that this pathway was involved in cell survival. These in vitro results were in line with a reduction of tumor growth by oral administration of RE in a xenograft model of colon cancer cells using athymic nude mice. These findings indicate that targeting colon cancer cells by increasing intracellular ROS and decreasing cell survival mechanisms may suppose a therapeutic option in colon cancer through the combination of rosemary compounds and chemotherapeutic drugs. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Although cure rates are high for early stage disease, clinical outcomes for advanced, metastatic, or recurrent disease remain poor. To change this panorama, a deeper understanding of cervical cancer biology and novel study models are needed. Immortalized human cancer cell lines such as HeLa constitute crucial scientific tools, but there are few other cervical cancer cell lines available, limiting our understanding of a disease known for its molecular heterogeneity. This study aimed to establish novel cervical cancer cell lines derived from Brazilian patients. We successfully established one (HCB-514) out of 35 cervical tumors biopsied. We confirmed the phenotype of HCB-514 by verifying its’ epithelial and tumor origin through cytokeratins, EpCAM and p16 staining. It was also HPV-16 positive. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) showed relevant somatic mutations in several genes including BRCA2, TGFBR1 and IRX2. A copy number variation (CNV) analysis by nanostring and WES revealed amplification of genes mainly related to kinases proteins involved in proliferation, migration and cell differentiation, such as EGFR, PIK3CA, and MAPK7. Overexpression of EGFR was confirmed by phospho RTK-array and validated by western blot analysis. Furthermore, the HCB-514 cell line was sensitive to cisplatin. In summary, this novel Brazilian cervical cancer cell line exhibits relevant key molecular features and constitutes a new biological model for pre-clinical studies. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

To determine how cancer cells adapt to RS, we have monitored the expression of different components of the ATR-CHK1 pathway in primary tumor samples. We show that unlike upstream components of the pathway, the checkpoint mediators Claspin and Timeless are overexpressed in a coordinated manner. Remarkably, reducing the levels of Claspin and Timeless in HCT116 cells to pretumoral levels impeded fork progression without affecting checkpoint signaling. These data indicate that high level of Claspin and Timeless increase RS tolerance by protecting replication forks in cancer cells. Moreover, we report that primary fibroblasts adapt to oncogene-induced RS by spontaneously overexpressing Claspin and Timeless, independently of ATR signaling. Altogether, these data indicate that enhanced levels of Claspin and Timeless represent a gain of function that protects cancer cells from of oncogene-induced RS in a checkpoint-independent manner. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Curcumin, the active polyphenol from turmeric, helps to obstruct the growth of many types of cancers at various stages which include prostrate, melanoma, breast, brain tumor, pancreatic, leukemia, etc. The initiation and recurrence of cancer have been attributed to few mutated cells in bulk of tumor called as cancer stem cells which have the capacity of self-renewal and differentiation. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3B) is a multifunctional serine/threonine protein kinase, originally found in mammals, an important component of diverse signaling pathways, dysregulation of which leads to affect the cancer stem cell properties. The nutritional- and phytochemical-based dietary interventions may complement current chemotherapy to prevent recurrence and relapse of cancer. The objective of present study is to investigate the effect of retinoic acid and curcumin–retinoic acid conjugates against GSK-3B protein.

Endometrial cancers are associated with several critical gene mutations, including PIK3A, PTEN, and KRAS. Different gene mutations in endometrial cancer cells have varied responses to anticancer drugs and cancer therapies. The most frequently altered gene in endometrioid endometrial carcinoma tumors is PTEN. PTEN protein has lipid phosphatase and protein phosphatase activity, as well as other functions in the nucleus. Although the tumor-suppressive function of PTEN has mainly been attributed to its lipid phosphatase activity, a role for PTEN protein phosphatase activity in cell cycle regulation has also been suggested. Various tumor type-specific PTEN mutations are well documented. Here, nine endometrioid endometrial cancer cell lines with PIK3A, PTEN, and KRAS gene mutations were treated with docetaxel and radiation. One mutation with a docetaxel drug-resistant effect was a truncated form of PTEN. Among PTEN mutations in endometrial cancer cells, the Y68 frame shift mutation of PTEN constitutes a major mechanism of resistance to docetaxel treatment. The molecular mechanism involves truncation of the 403 amino acid PTEN protein at amino acid 68 by the Y68 frame shift, leading to the loss of PTEN protein phosphatase and lipid phosphatase activities. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

The present review comprehends the stimuli-responsive polymers and multi-responsiveness with respect to cancer therapy. It focuses on the exploitation of different stimuli like temperature, pH and enzymes responsiveness in a multi-stimuli setting. Nanogels and micelles being two of the most commonly used responsive polymeric carriers have also been discussed. The role of multiple stimuli delivery system is significant due to multiple changes happening in the near surroundings of cancer cells.

In contrast, antibodies to BLV were found in a very small percentage of healthy blood donors. There was no association between BLV DNA and other tumor prognostic biological markers such as hormonal receptors, HER2 oncoprotein, proliferation index, metastasis in sentinels lymph nodes, and tumor grade and size. Our findings suggest that BLV should be considered a potential predisposing factor to breast cancer in women. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Copy number loss of PIK3R1 (p85α) most commonly occurs in ovarian cancer among all cancer types. Here we report that ovarian cancer cells manifest a spectrum of tumorigenic phenotypes upon knockdown of PIK3R1. PIK3R1 loss activates AKT and p110-independent JAK2/STAT3 signaling through inducing changes in the phosphorylation of the docking protein Gab2, thereby relieving the negative inhibition on AKT and promoting the assembly of JAK2/STAT3 signalosome, respectively. Additional mechanisms leading to AKT activation include enhanced p110α kinase activity and a decrease in PTEN level. PIK3R1 loss renders ovarian cancer cells vulnerable to inhibition of AKT or JAK2/STAT3. The combination of AKT and STAT3 inhibitors significantly increases the anti-tumor effect compared to single-agent treatments. Together, our findings provide a rationale for mechanism-based therapeutic approach that targets tumors with loss of PIK3R1. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we perform Repli-Seq and integrated epigenome analyses and demonstrate that genomic regions that undergo long-range epigenetic deregulation in prostate cancer also show concordant differences in replication timing. A subset of altered replication timing domains are conserved across cancers from different tissue origins. Notably, late-replicating regions in cancer cells display a loss of DNA methylation, and a switch in heterochromatin features from H3K9me3-marked constitutive to H3K27me3-marked facultative heterochromatin. Finally, analysis of 214 prostate and 35 breast cancer genomes reveal that late-replicating regions are prone to cis and early-replication to trans chromosomal rearrangements. Together, our data suggests that the nature of chromosomal rearrangement in cancer is related to the spatial and temporal positioning and altered epigenetic states of early-replicating compared to late-replicating loci. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are promising therapies for haematological cancers. Historically, their therapeutic benefit is due to ADC targeting of lineage-restricted antigens. The C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is attractive for targeted therapy of haematological cancers, given its expression in multiple tumour types and role in cancer “homing” to bone marrow. However, CXCR4 is also expressed in haematopoietic cells and other normal tissues, raising safety challenges to the development of anti-CXCR4 ADCs for cancer treatment. Here, we designed the first anti-CXCR4 ADC with favourable therapeutic index, effective in xenografts of haematopoietic cancers resistant to standard of care and anti-CXCR4 antibodies. We screened multiple ADC configurations, by varying type of linker-payload, drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR), affinity and Fc format. The optimal ADC bears a non-cleavable linker, auristatin as payload at DAR = 4 and a low affinity antibody with effector–reduced Fc. Contrary to other drugs targeting CXCR4, anti-CXCR4 ADCs effectively eliminated cancer cells as monotherapy, while minimizing leucocytosis. The optimal ADC selectively eliminated CXCR4 + cancer cells in solid tumours, but showed limited toxicity to normal CXCR4 + tissues, sparing haematopoietic stem cells and progenitors. Our work provides proof-of-concept that through empirical ADC design, it is possible to target proteins with broad normal tissue expression. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Cancers in the bone produce a number of severe symptoms including pain that compromises patient functional status, quality of life, and survival. The source of this pain is multifaceted and includes factors secreted from tumor cells. Malignant cells release the neurotransmitter and cell-signaling molecule glutamate via the oxidative stress-related cystine/glutamate antiporter, system x C − , which reciprocally imports cystine for synthesis of glutathione and the cystine/cysteine redox cycle. Pharmacological inhibition of system x C − has shown success in reducing and delaying the onset of cancer pain-related behavior in mouse models. This investigation describes the development of a stable siRNA-induced knockdown of the functional trans-membrane system x C − subunit xCT (SLC7A11) in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Clones were verified for xCT knockdown at the transcript, protein, and functional levels. RNAseq was performed on a representative clone to comprehensively examine the transcriptional cellular signature in response to xCT knockdown, identifying multiple differentially regulated factors relevant to cancer pain including nerve growth factor, interleukin-1, and colony-stimulating factor-1. Mice were inoculated intrafemorally and recordings of pain-related behaviors including weight bearing, mechanical withdrawal, and limb use were performed. Animals implanted with xCT knockdown cancer cells displayed a delay until the onset of nociceptive behaviors relative to control cells. These results add to the body of evidence suggesting that a reduction in glutamate release from cancers in bone by inhibition of the system x C − transporter may decrease the severe and intractable pain associated with bone metastases. © The Author(s) 2018." ;

Method: For finding the related articles, the researchers searched several databases including PubMed &ProQuest and valid websites including ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Scientific Information Database, and Magiran. The key terms of \"reflexology, cancer, and chemotherapy\" individually and combined together were searched in Parisian and English, and the studies performed from 2009 to 2018 were extracted. Due to the lack of sufficient studies carried out into the outcome of reflexology on chemotherapy, both Persian and English articles were used. Results: A total of 57 studies were extracted from the databases and valid websites; five of which met the inclusion criteria. All selected studies were clinical trials. Implications for Practice: Reflexology can be used as a non-pharmacologic nursing intervention to alleviate the side effects of chemotherapy and improve the quality of life of cancer patients. © 2018 Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

For effective evaluation of this strategy it is crucial to identify which patients are suited for CD47-targeted therapy. In this respect, expression of the pro-phagocytic signal SLAMF7 on both macrophages and cancer cells was recently reported to be a requisite for CD47 antibody-mediated phagocytosis. Here, we demonstrate that in fact SLAMF7 expression on cancer cells is not required and does not impact on CD47 antibody therapy. Moreover, SLAMF7 also does not impact on phagocytosis induction by CD20 antibody rituximab nor associates with overall survival of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma patients. In contrast, expression of CD47 negatively impacts on overall and progression free survival. In conclusion, cancer cell expression of SLAMF7 is not required for phagocytosis and, in contrast to CD47 expression, should not be used as selection criterion for CD47-targeted therapy. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Increased Crabp2 levels have been found in various types of cancer, and are associated with poor patients’ survival. Although Crabp2 is found to be overexpressed in lung cancer, its role in metastasis of lung cancer is unclear. In this study, Crabp2 was overexpressed in high-metastatic C10F4 than low-metastatic lung cancer cells. Analysis of clinical samples revealed that high CRABP2 levels were correlated with lymph node metastases, poor overall survival, and increased recurrence. Knockdown of Crabp2 decreased migration, invasion, anoikis resistance, and in vivo metastasis. Crabp2 was co-immunoprecipitated with HuR, and overexpression of Crabp2 increased HuR levels, which promoted integrin β1/FAK/ERK signaling. Inhibition of HuR or integrin β1/FAK/ERK signaling reversed the promoting effect of Crabp2 in migration, invasion, and anoikis resistance. Knockdown of Crabp2 further inhibited the growth of cancer cells as compared with that by gemcitabine or irinotecan alone. The expression of Crabp2 in human lung tumors was correlated with stress marker CHOP. In conclusion, our findings have identified the promoting role of Crabp2 in anoikis resistance and metastasis. CRABP2 may serve as a prognostic marker and targeting CRABP2 may be exploited as a modality to reduce metastasis. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "SPG-56 is a newly isolated glycoprotein from sweet potatoes (Zhongshu NO. 1), but its value for suppressing breast cancer progression remains unknown. This study was designed to investigate the potential anti-cancer effects of SPG-56, which consists of 2.9% sugar and 97.1% protein. The effects of SPG-56 on the proliferation and apoptosis of breast cancer cells were determined using CCK-8 and Hoechst 33342 assays and flow cytometry, after staining with Annexin V and PI respectively. The activities of SPG-56 against breast cancer were examined using female BALB/c nude mice orthotopically implanted with human breast carcinoma cells of the types MCF-7 and 4T1-Luc. The cellular experiments showed that SPG-56 inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of MCF-7 cells dose- and time-dependently. Oral administration of SPG-56 significantly suppressed the development of MCF-7 tumor cells (P < 0.01) as compared with an untreated group. The serum tumor markers CEA, CA125 and CA153 in a 240 mg/kg/d SPG-56 decreased by 54.8%, 91.8%, and 90.3%, respectively. The experiments further demonstrated that SPG-56 inhibited the metastasis of breast cancer in MCF-7 and 4T1-bearing mice by altering the expression of MMP2, MMP9, VEGF, Occludin and Claudin. It is concluded that SPG-56 may have potential as a novel anti-tumor candidate for breast cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Lymph node metastasis is of major prognostic significance for breast cancer. Lymph node metastasis arises at a very early stage in some patients. Using the data downloaded from the TCGA database, we studied the differences between primary tumors with and without lymph node metastasis at the multi-omics level using bioinformatics approaches. Our study found that low mutation and neoantigen burdens correlated with lymph node metastazation of breast cancer. All three conserved domains in TP53 were mutated in lymph node-negative breast cancers, whereas only one domain was mutated in lymph node-positive samples. Mutations in microtubule-related proteins appear to help immune cells recognize tumors and inhibit their lymph node metastasis. Destroying microtubule-related proteins is a potential therapeutic strategy to inhibit lymph node metastasis of breast cancer. As the neoantigens specifically present in lymph node-positive breast cancers, MAPK10, BC9L, TRIM65, CD93, KITLG, CNPPD1, CPED1, CCDC146, TMEM185A, INO80D, and PSMD11 are potential targets for vaccine design. In the tumor microenvironment, reduced numbers of effector immune cells, especially activated memory CD4+ T cells and activated mast cells, facilitate breast cancer metastasis to the lymph nodes. According to transcriptome data, lymph node metastasis was mostly driven by gene mutation rather than by gene expression. Although differential gene expression analysis was based on lymph node metastasis status, many genes were shown to be differentially expressed based on estrogen receptor status. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Fibroblasts turn into cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumour microenvironment. CAFs have recently attracted attention for their function as a regulator of immune cell recruitment and function in addition to their tumour-promoting roles. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of CAFs on monocyte recruitment and macrophage polarization in breast cancer. CAFs, which were α-SMA expressing fibroblasts in contrast to normal fibroblasts (NFs), effectively recruited monocytes. Recruitment of monocytes by CAFs might be mediated by monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) as well as stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) cytokines. CAFs differentiated the recruited monocytes into M2-like macrophages which are capable of exerting their immunosuppressive roles via the PD-1 axis. CAF-educated monocytes exhibited strong immune suppression unlike NF-educated monocytes and enhanced the motility/invasion of breast cancer cells in addition to increasing the expressions of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes and vimentin protein in cancer cells. CAF-educated M1 macrophages displayed increased expression of M2 markers and production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in contrast to decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12 compared with control M1 macrophages; suggesting that CAFs were also able to induce the trans-differentiation of M1 macrophages to M2 macrophages. We then investigated the relationship between the infiltration of CAFs and tumour associated macrophages (TAMs) using tissue samples obtained from breast cancer patients. High grade of CAFs significantly correlated with the number of TAMs in human breast cancer tissue samples. It was also associated with higher Ki-67 proliferation index, and higher tumour volume. This result is in line with our finding of increased breast cancer cell proliferation due to the effects of CAF-educated monocytes in vitro. Our results concluded that CAFs play pivotal roles in sculpturing the tumour microenvironment in breast cancer, and therapeutic strategies to reverse the CAF-mediated immunosuppressive microenvironment should be taken into consideration. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

We construct iCells of four cancers and the corresponding tissue controls and identify the most rewired genes in cancer. Many of them are of unknown function and cannot be identified as different in cancer in any specific molecular network. We biologically validate that they have a role in cancer by knockdown experiments followed by cell viability assays. We find additional support through Kaplan-Meier survival curves of thousands of patients. Finally, we extend this analysis to uncover pan-cancer genes.

The increasing popularity of sequencing technologies motivates the in-silico identification of CCLs based on their mutational fingerprint, but care must be taken when identifying heterogeneous data. We recently developed the proof-of-concept Uniquorn 1 method which could reliably identify heterogeneous sequencing data from selected sequencing technologies. Here we present Uniquorn 2, a generic and robust in-silico identification method for CCLs with DNA/RNA-seq and panel-seq information. We benchmarked Uniquorn 2 by cross-identifying 1612 RNA and 3596 panel-sized NGS profiles derived from 1516 CCLs, five repositories, four technologies and three major cancer panel-designs. Our method achieves an accuracy of 96% for RNA-seq and 95% for mixed DNA-seq and RNA-seq identification. Even for a panel of only 94 cancer-related genes, accuracy remains at 82% but decreases when using smaller panels.

In this ex vivo study of nine fresh human colon specimens, we report the first use of quantified subsurface scattering coefficient maps acquired by swept-source optical coherence tomography to reveal subsurface abnormities. We generate subsurface scattering coefficient maps with a novel wavelet-based-curve-fitting method that provides significantly improved accuracy. The angular spectra of scattering coefficient maps of normal tissues exhibit a spatial feature distinct from those of abnormal tissues. An angular spectrum index to quantify the differences between the normal and abnormal tissues is derived, and its strength in revealing subsurface cancer in ex vivo samples is statistically analyzed. The study demonstrates that the angular spectrum of the scattering coefficient map can effectively reveal subsurface colorectal cancer and potentially provide a fast and more accurate diagnosis. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Current options in palliation such as hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) present severe side effects. Recent research efforts suggested the therapeutic use of oxidant-enriched liquid using cold physical plasma. To investigate a clinically accepted treatment regimen, we assessed the antitumor capacity of plasma-treated saline solution. In response to such liquid, CT26 murine colon cancer cells were readily oxidized and showed cell growth with subsequent apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and upregulation of immunogenic cell death (ICD) markers in vitro. This was accompanied by marked morphological changes with re-arrangement of actin fibers and reduced motility. Induction of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype was not observed. Key results were confirmed in MC38 colon and PDA6606 pancreatic cancer cells. Compared to plasma-treated saline, hydrogen peroxide was inferiorly toxic in 3D tumor spheroids but of similar efficacy in 2D models. In vivo, plasma-treated saline decreased tumor burden in Balb/C mice. This was concomitant with elevated numbers of intratumoral macrophages and increased T cell activation following incubation with CT26 cells ex vivo. Being a potential adjuvant for HIPEC therapy, our results suggest oxidizing saline solutions to inactivate colon cancer cells while potentially stimulating antitumor immune responses. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Although solid fuel combustion emissions are known to increase the prevalence of illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer, however, their effect on the eyes is underexplored. This study assesses the acute toxicity of solid fuel combustion emissions on healthy ocular cells and a cancer cell line. Three healthy ocular cell lines (corneal, lens, and retinal epithelial cells) and a cancer cell line (Chinese hamster ovary cells) were exposed to liquid and gas phase emissions from applewood and coal combustion. Following the exposure, real-time cell attachment behavior was monitored for at least 120 hours with electrical cell impedance spectroscopy. The viability of the cells, amount of apoptotic cells, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were quantified with MTT, ApoTox-Glo, and ROS-Glo H 2 O 2 assays, respectively. The results showed that coal emissions compromised the viability of ocular cells more than applewood emissions. Interestingly, the cancer cells, although their viability was not compromised, generated 1.7 to 2.7 times more ROS than healthy cells. This acute exposure study provides compelling proof that biomass combustion emissions compromise the viability of ocular cells and increase ROS generation. The increased ROS generation was fatal for ocular cells, but it promoted the growth of cancer cells. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

The goal of this study was to classify mice with and without tumors and compare tumors localized to the mammary pad and tumor cells injected into the iliac artery by differences in VOCs in urine. After 4T1.2 tumor cells were injected into BALB/c mice either in the mammary pad or into the iliac artery, urine was collected, VOCs from urine headspace were concentrated by solid phase microextraction and results were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry quadrupole time-of-flight. Multivariate and univariate statistical analyses were employed to find potential biomarkers for breast cancer and metastatic breast cancer in mice models. A set of six VOCs classified mice with and without tumors with an area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC AUC) of 0.98 (95% confidence interval [0.85, 1.00]) via five-fold cross validation.

Moreover, the high drug loading capacity of Cet-SLN was employed to encapsulate photothermal agent indocyanine green (ICG) to finally fabricate a versatile drug delivery system (DDS) able to co-deliver Cet and ICG (Cet-SLN/ICG) for combinational chemo-photothermal therapy of breast cancer. The obtained results clearly demonstrated that Cet-SLN/ICG was well-dispersed nanoparticles with preferable stability under physiological condition. Furthermore, due to the conjugation of Cet, Cet-SLN/ICG could target EGFR which overexpress in MCF-7 cells. Most importantly, both in vitro and in vivo results suggested that compared with Cet or ICG alone, the Cet-SLN/ICG showed superior anticancer efficacy.

        fabio:abstract    "The integration of genomic and DNA methylation data has been demonstrated as a powerful strategy in understanding cancer mechanisms and identifying therapeutic targets. The TCGA consortium has mapped DNA methylation in thousands of cancer samples using Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 K BeadChip (Illumina 450 K array) that only covers about 1.5% of CpGs in the human genome. Therefore, increasing the coverage of the DNA methylome would significantly leverage the usage of the TCGA data. Here, we present a new model called EAGLING that can expand the Illumina 450 K array data 18 times to cover about 30% of the CpGs in the human genome. We applied it to analyze 13 cancers in TCGA. By integrating the expanded methylation, gene expression, and somatic mutation data, we identified the genes showing differential patterns in each of the 13 cancers. Many of the triple-evidenced genes identified in majority of the cancers are biomarkers or potential biomarkers. Pan-cancer analysis also revealed the pathways in which the triple-evidenced genes are enriched, which include well known ones as well as new ones, such as axonal guidance signaling pathway and pathways related to inflammatory processing or inflammation response. Triple-evidenced genes, particularly TNXB, RRM2, CELSR3, SLC16A3, FANCI, MMP9, MMP11, SIK1, and TRIM59 showed superior predictive power in both tumor diagnosis and prognosis. These results have demonstrated that the integrative analysis using the expanded methylation data is powerful in identifying critical genes/pathways that may serve as new therapeutic targets. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "A key challenge facing immunotherapy is poor infiltration of T cells into tumors, along with suppression of cells reaching these sites. However, macrophages make up a majority of immune cell infiltrates into tumors, creating natural targets for immunotherapies able to direct macrophages away from tumor-supportive functions and toward anti-tumor phenotypes. Recent studies demonstrate that toll-like receptors (TLRs) – pathways that quickly trigger early immune responses – play an important role in polarizing macrophages. Here, we present emerging ways in which TLR signaling is being manipulated in macrophages to create new opportunities for cancer immunotherapy. In particular, we discuss approaches to deliver TLR agonists, to leverage biomaterials in these therapies, and to couple TLR-based approaches with other frontline treatments as combination cancer therapies. © 2018" ;

However, immune checkpoint inhibitors are only advantageous for a limited population of cancer patients. Therefore, companion diagnostics are needed in order to identify patients for whom these therapies are effective. In the present study, we evaluated detailed immunological aspects in clinical specimens from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. We analyzed the immune profiles, T cell cytotoxicity, and TCR repertoire of peripheral blood, normal lung tissue, and tumor tissue from NSCLC patients. By using bispecific T-cell engager technology to assess the cytotoxicity of T cells, we found that the cytotoxicity of tumor-infiltrated T cells closely correlated with that of peripheral T cells. This correlation was supported by the immune profiles, cytokine production, and results of the TCR repertoire analysis from these specimens. We also found that the cytotoxicity of peripheral T cells has potential as a predictor of the effects of nivolumab in the tumor microenvironment. These results imply further applications to blood-based immune monitoring systems and predictive biomarkers for cancer immunotherapy. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

This standard procedure relies on the slow radioactivity loss, usually attributed to the limited tumour expression of G6P-phosphatase (G6Pase). However, this classical interpretation intrinsically represents an approximation since, as in all tissues, cancer G6Pase activity is remarkable and is confined to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whose lumen must be reached by phosphorylated FDG to explain its hydrolysis and radioactivity release. The present study tested the impact of G6Pase sequestration on the mathematical description of FDG trafficking and handling in cultured cancer cells. Our data show that accounting for tracer access to the ER configures this compartment as the preferential site of FDG accumulation. This is confirmed by the reticular localization of fluorescent FDG analogues. Remarkably enough, reticular accumulation rate of FDG is dependent upon extracellular glucose availability, thus configuring the same ER as a significant determinant of cancer glucose metabolism. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Although current methods of treatment for cervical cancer can ablate lesions, preventing metastatic disseminations and excessive tissue injuries still remains a major concern. Hence, development of a safer and more efficient treatment modality is of vital importance. Natural products from plants are one of the principal sources of precursors to lead compounds with direct pharmaceutical application across all disease classes. One of these plants is Ficus carica, whose fruit latex, when applied on HPV-induced skin warts, has shown potential as a possible cure for this virus related lesions. This study explores the in vitro biological activities of fig latex and elucidates its possible mechanisms of action on cervical cancer cell lines CaSki and HeLa positive for HPV type 16 and 18, respectively. Our data shows that fig latex inhibits properties that are associated with HPV-positive cervical cancer transformed cells such as rapid growth and invasion and substantially downregulated the expression of p16 and HPV onco-proteins E6, E7. These findings suggest Ficus carica latex has the potential to be used in the development of therapeutic modalities for the possible treatment, cure and prevention of HPV related cervical cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing methods, the diversity and composition of the microbiota from ovarian cancer tissues (25 samples) and normal distal fallopian tube tissues (25 samples) were analyzed. High-throughput sequencing showed that the diversity and richness indexes were significantly decreased in ovarian cancer tissues compared to tissues from normal distal fallopian tubes. The ratio of the two phyla for Proteobacteria/Firmicutes was notably increased in ovarian cancer, which revealed that microbial composition change might be associated with the process of ovarian cancer development. In addition, transcriptome-sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses suggested that the transcriptional profiles were statistically different between ovarian carcinoma and normal distal fallopian tubes. Moreover, a set of genes including 84 different inflammation-associated or immune-associated genes, which had been named as the human antibacterial-response genes were also modulated expression. Therefore, we hypothesize that the microbial composition change, as a novel risk factor, may be involving the initiation and progression of ovarian cancer via influencing and regulating the local immune microenvironment of fallopian tubes except for regular pathways. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Several pioneering work have established that apart from genetic alterations, epigenetic modifications contribute significantly in tumor progression. Remarkable role of EZH2 in cancer highlights the importance of identifying its targets. Although much emphasis has been placed in recent years in designing drugs and inhibitors targeting EZH2, less effort has been given in exploring its existing targets that will help in understanding the oncogenic role of EZH2 in turn which may provide a more stringent method of targeting EZH2. In the present study, we validated six direct targets of EZH2 that are GPNMB, PMEPA1, CoL5A1, VGLL4, POMT2 and SUMF1 associated with cancer related pathways. Upon EZH2 knockdown, more than two fold increase in the target gene expression was evident. CHIP-qPCR performed in both MCF-7 and MDA-MDA-231 confirmed the in-vivo binding of EZH2 on its identified target. Thirty invasive breast carcinoma cases with their adjacent normal tissues were included in the study. Immunohistochemistry in primary breast tumor tissue array showed tumor dependent expression of EZH2. Array of MERAV expression database revealed the strength of association of EZH2 with its target genes. Real time PCR performed with RNA extracted from breast tumor tissues further authenticated the existing negative correlation between EZH2 and its target genes. Pearson correlation coefficient & statistical significance computed using the matrix provided in the database strengthened the negative correlation between identified target genes and EZH2. KM plotter analysis showed improved relapse-free survival with increased expression of PMEPA1, POMT2, VGLL4 and SUMF1 in breast cancer patients indicating their therapeutic potential. While investigating the relevance of these target genes, different mutations of them were found in breast cancer patients. Seeking the clinical relevance of our study, following our recent publication that reports the role of EZH2 in nicotine-mediated breast cancer development and progression, we observed significant reduced expression of SUMF1 in breast cancer patient samples with smoking history in comparison to never-smoked patient samples. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we report that TOP1MT is overexpressed in cancer tissues and demonstrate that TOP1MT deficiency attenuates tumor growth in human and mouse models of colon and liver cancer. Due to their mitochondrial dysfunction, TOP1MT-KO cells become addicted to glycolysis, which limits synthetic building blocks and energy supply required for the proliferation of cancer cells in a nutrient-deprived tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, we show that TOP1MT associates with mitoribosomal subunits, ensuring optimal mitochondrial translation and assembly of oxidative phosphorylation complexes that are critical for sustaining tumor growth. The TOP1MT genomic signature profile, based on Top1mt-KO liver cancers, is correlated with enhanced survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients.

A new data integrative approach, based on graphical models, was applied on our multi-modal –omics, and clinical data cohort of metastatic melanoma patients. We found that response to chemotherapy is directly linked to ten gene expression, four methylation variables and PARP1 SNP rs1805407. PARP1 is a DNA repair gene critical for chemotherapy response and for which FDA-approved inhibitors are clinically available (olaparib). We demonstrated that two PARP inhibitors (ABT-888 and olaparib) make SNP carrier cancer cells of various histologic subtypes more sensitive to alkylating agents, but they have no effect in wild-type cells. Furthermore, PARP1 inhibitors act synergistically with chemotherapy in SNP carrier cells (especially in ovarian cancer for which olaparib is FDA-approved), but they are additive at best in wild-type cancer cells. Taken together, our results suggest that the combination of chemotherapy and PARP1 inhibition may benefit the carriers of rs1805407 in the future and may be used in personalized therapy strategies to select patients that are more likely to respond to PARP inhibitors. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Earlier studies have shown that bovine α -lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells (BAMLET) becomes cytotoxic against cancer cells in complex with oleic acid {Hoque, M. et. al., PLoSOne8, e68390 (2013)}. In our study, we obtained bovine α-lactalbumin complexed with lanthanum ion (La 3+ -B-α-LA) and determined its high resolution crystal structure. The natural calcium binding site of bovine α-lactalbumin is replaced by lanthanum. The La 3+ complex formation by B-α-apo-LA was also supported by various biophysical methods. Interestingly, our complex, La 3+ -B-α-LA exhibits much greater anticancer activity against breast cancer cells as compared to the reported BAMLET-oleic acid complex. This study shows that La 3+ -B-α-LA complex is preferentially more toxic to MCF-7 cells as compared to KB (oral cancer) and HeLa (cervical) cells, while almost non-toxic to the healthy cells that we studied. Our data indicates that the cytotoxicity of La 3+ -B-α-LA against cancer cells is through apoptotic path way. The higher anticancer activity of La 3+ -B-α-LA is attributable to the requisite structural changes induced in the protein by La 3+ binding as supported by the crystal structure of the complex. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

However, no studies have evaluated vascular pain in patients with colorectal cancer in relation to peripheral venous administration of chemotherapy with or without oxaliplatin. We evaluated oxaliplatin-induced vascular pain using subjective and objective methods. We determined if oxaliplatin induced vascular pain in patients with colorectal cancer using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and a PainVision PS-2100 device. We compared VAS score between chemotherapy regimens with or without oxaliplatin, and between genders. We also examined the correlations of VAS score with pain intensity examined by the PainVision PS-2100, and with age and vessel diameter. A total of 98 patients with colorectal cancer were enrolled in this study, including 78 patients who received oxaliplatin via peripheral venous administration and 20 who received chemotherapy without oxaliplatin. The median VAS scores in patients with and without oxaliplatin were 36.5 (interquartile range 9.0–60.0) and 0 (0–4.0), respectively (P < 0.001), and the median pain intensities according to PainVision were 43.5 (14.3–98) and 36.5 (9.3–58.5), respectively (P < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between VAS and pain intensity (r = 0.584), but no correlation between VAS score and age (r = −0.174) or vessel diameter (r = −0.107). Peripheral venous administration of oxaliplatin induced vascular pain, measured both subjectively and objectively, in patients with colorectal cancer, regardless of vessel diameter. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Primary bronchial cancer accounts for almost 20% of all cancer death worldwide. One of the emerging techniques with tremendous power for lung cancer therapy is magnetic aerosol drug targeting (MADT). The use of a permanent magnet for effective drug delivery in a desired location throughout the lung requires extensive optimization, but it has not been addressed yet. In the present study, the possibility of using a permanent magnet for trapping the particles on a lung tumor is evaluated numerically in the Weibel's model from G0 to G3. The effect of different parameters is considered on the efficiency of particle deposition in a tumor located on a distant position of the lung bronchi and bronchioles. Also, the effective position of the magnetic source, tumor size, and location are the objectives for particle deposition. The results show that a limited particle deposition occurs on the lung branches in passive targeting. However, the incorporation of a permanent magnet next to the tumor enhanced the particle deposition fraction on G2 to up to 49% for the particles of 7 µm diameter. Optimizing the magnet size could also improve the particle deposition fraction by 68%. It was also shown that the utilization of MADT is essential for effective drug delivery to the tumors located on the lower wall of airway branches given the dominance of the air velocity and resultant drag force in this region. The results demonstrated the high competence and necessity of MADT as a noninvasive drug delivery method for lung cancer therapy." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. Adjuvant chemotherapy has significantly reduced mortality but increased cognitive impairments, including attention function, making quality of life issues a crucial concern. This study enrolled nineteen breast cancer patients who were treated with standard chemotherapy within 6 months and 20 sex-matched healthy controls to investigate the brain effects of chemotherapy. All participants underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) with mean fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (mfALFF) analysis and were correlated with neuropsychological tests, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised (CAMS-R), and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), to explore the possible underlying mechanism of cognitive alternations. We found increased mfALFF over the frontoparietal lobe and decreased mfALFF over the occipital lobe in the cancer patients compared with the healthy controls; the altered brain regions may be associated with the dorsal attention network (DAN) and may be explained by a compensatory mechanism. Both MMSE and CAMS-R scores showed a positive correlation with mfALFF in the occipital lobe but a negative correlation in the frontoparietal lobe. By contrast, IES-R scores showed a positive correlation with mfALFF in the frontoparietal lobe but a negative correlation in the occipital lobe. These alterations are potentially related to the effects of both chemotherapy and psychological distress. Future research involving a larger sample size of patients with breast cancer is recommended. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

In the case of mutations in individual genes that cause them to be incorrectly spliced, engineered splicing factors can be introduced to correct splicing of these aberrant transcripts and reduce the effects of the disease phenotype. Mutations that occur in certain splicing factor genes themselves have been implicated in many cancers, particularly myelodysplastic syndromes. Small molecules that target splicing factors have been developed as therapies to preferentially induce apoptosis in these cancer cells. Specifically, drugs targeting the splicing factor SF3B1 have led to recent clinical trials.

Analysis of AA-reconstructed amplicons in a pan-cancer dataset reveals many novel properties of copy number amplifications in cancer. These findings support a model in which focal amplifications arise due to the formation and replication of extrachromosomal DNA. Applying AA to 68 viral-mediated cancer samples, we identify a large fraction of amplicons with specific structural signatures suggestive of hybrid, human-viral extrachromosomal DNA.

There have been many attempts to identify markers and key pathways induced throughout EMT but the process is complex and depends on the cancer type and tumour microenvironment. Here we used the colon cancer cell line HT29, which stably overexpressed Snail, the key transcription factor in early EMT, as a model for colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with a pro-metastatic phenotype. We investigated miRNA expression regulation during that phenotypic switching. We found that overexpression of Snail in HT29 cells triggered significant changes in individual miRNA levels but did not change the global efficiency of miRNA processing. Snail abundance repressed the expression of miR-192 and miR-194 and increased miR-205, let-7i and SNORD13 levels. These identified changes correlated with the reported transcriptomic alterations in Snail-overexpressing HT29 cells. We also investigated how Snail affected the miRNA content of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from HT29 cells. Our data suggest that the presence of Snail significantly alters the complex mRNA/miRNA interactions in the early steps of metastasis and also has an impact on the content of EVs released from HT29 cells. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

This retrospective case-control study compared patients who had lung cancer with PJP (n = 112) or without PJP (n = 336) matched according to age, sex, histopathology, and stage. PJP definition was based on (i) positive PCR or direct immunofluorescence results for pneumocystis, (ii) clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities that were consistent with a pneumonic process, and (iii) received targeted PJP treatment. The development of PJP was associated with radiotherapy (RTx), concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRTx), lymphopenia, and prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (20 mg of prednisolone equivalent per day for ≥3 weeks). Multivariate analysis revealed independent associations with prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06–3.63; p = 0.032) and CCRTx (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.27–3.43; p = 0.004). Steroid use was frequently related to RTx pneumonitis or esophagitis (29 patients, 43.3%). Prolonged high-dose steroid therapy and CCRTx were risk factors for PJP development among patients with lung cancer. As these patients had a poor prognosis, clinicians should consider PJP prophylaxis for high-risk patients with lung cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

We performed an in silico analysis to determine the concordance in the frequencies of actionable mutations and copy number alterations/aberrations (CNAs) in the two most common breast cancer histologies, invasive lobular and invasive ductal carcinoma. We found that targeted sequencing identified a larger number of mutational hotspots and clinically significant amplifications that would have been missed by WES and SNP arrays in many actionable genes such as PIK3CA, EGFR, AKT3, FGFR1, ERBB2, ERBB3 and ESR1. The striking differences between the number of mutational hotspots and CNAs generated from these platforms highlight a number of factors that should be considered in the interpretation of array and NGS-based genomic data for precision medicine.

Several oxaliplatin transporters were previously identified but their relative contributions to determining oxaliplatin tumour responses and gastrointestinal tumour cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin remains unclear. We studied clinical associations between tumour expression of oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes and patient response to oxaliplatin, then experimentally verified associations found with MRP2 in models of human gastrointestinal cancer. Among 18 oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes, MRP2 was the only one to be differentially expressed in the tumours of colorectal cancer patients who did or did not respond to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Over-expression of MRP2 (endogenously in HepG2 and PANC-1 cells, or induced by stable transfection of HEK293 cells) decreased oxaliplatin accumulation and cytotoxicity but those deficits were reversed by inhibition of MRP2 with myricetin or siRNA knockdown. Mice bearing subcutaneous HepG2 tumour xenografts were sensitised to oxaliplatin antitumour activity by concurrent myricetin treatment with little or no increase in toxicity. In conclusion, MRP2 limits oxaliplatin accumulation and response in human gastrointestinal cancer.

We compare optimized gene signatures for cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin responses in the same cell lines and validate each signature using data from patients with cancer. Supervised support vector machine learning is used to derive gene sets whose expression is related to the cell line GI50 values by backwards feature selection with cross-validation. Specific genes and functional pathways distinguishing sensitive from resistant cell lines are identified by contrasting signatures obtained at extreme and median GI50 thresholds. Ensembles of gene signatures at different thresholds are combined to reduce the dependence on specific GI50 values for predicting drug responses. The most accurate gene signatures for each platin are: cisplatin: BARD1, BCL2, BCL2L1, CDKN2C, FAAP24, FEN1, MAP3K1, MAPK13, MAPK3, NFKB1, NFKB2, SLC22A5, SLC31A2, TLR4, and TWIST1; carboplatin: AKT1, EIF3K, ERCC1, GNGT1, GSR, MTHFR, NEDD4L, NLRP1, NRAS, RAF1, SGK1, TIGD1, TP53, VEGFB, and VEGFC; and oxaliplatin: BRAF, FCGR2A, IGF1, MSH2, NAGK, NFE2L2, NQO1, PANK3, SLC47A1, SLCO1B1, and UGT1A1. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with bladder, ovarian, and colorectal cancer were used to test the cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin signatures, resulting in 71.0%, 60.2%, and 54.5% accuracies in predicting disease recurrence and 59%, 61%, and 72% accuracies in predicting remission, respectively. One cisplatin signature predicted 100% of recurrence in non-smoking patients with bladder cancer (57% disease-free; N = 19), and 79% recurrence in smokers (62% disease-free; N = 35).

MTH1 dephosphorylates oxidized nucleotides, thereby preventing their incorporation into DNA and protecting tumour cells from oxidative DNA damage. Inhibitors of MTH1 (TH588 and (S)-crizotinib) were shown to reduce cancer cell viability. However, the MTH1-dependency of the anti-cancer effects of these drugs has recently been questioned. Here, we have assessed anti-tumour effects of TH588 and (S)-crizotinib in patient-derived 3D colorectal cancer cultures. Hypoxia and reoxygenation – conditions that increase intracellular ROS levels – increased sensitivity to (S)-crizotinib, but not to TH588. (S)-crizotinib reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-MET and ErbB3 whereas TH588 induced a mitotic cell cycle arrest, which was not affected by adding ROS-modulating compounds. Furthermore, we show that both compounds induced DNA damage that could not be prevented by adding the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Moreover, adding ROS-modulating compounds did not alter the reduction in viability in response to TH588 and (S)-crizotinib. We conclude that TH588 and (S)-crizotinib have very clear and distinct anti-tumour effects in 3D colorectal cancer cultures, but that these effects most likely occur through distinct and ROS-independent mechanisms. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Iron deposits are a phenotypic trait of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Histological iron imaging and contrast-agent free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect these deposits, but their presence in human cancer, and correlation with immunotherapeutic response is largely untested. Here, primarily using these iron imaging approaches, we evaluated the spatial distribution of polarized macrophage populations containing high endogenous levels of iron in preclinical murine models and human breast cancer, and used them as metabolic biomarkers to correlate TAM infiltration with response to immunotherapy in preclinical trials. Macrophage-targeted inhibition of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) by immunotherapy was confirmed to inhibit macrophage accumulation and slow mammary tumor growth in mouse models while also reducing hemosiderin iron-laden TAM accumulation as measured by both iron histology and in vivo iron MRI (FeMRI). Spatial profiling of TAM iron deposit infiltration defined regions of maximal accumulation and response to the CSF1R inhibitor, and revealed differences between microenvironments of human cancer according to levels of polarized macrophage iron accumulation in stromal margins. We therefore demonstrate that iron deposition serves as an endogenous metabolic imaging biomarker of TAM infiltration in breast cancer that has high translational potential for evaluation of immunotherapeutic response. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "More than 50% of colon cancers bear mutations in p53, one of the most important tumor suppressors, and its family members p63 or p73 are expected to contribute to inhibiting the progression of colon cancers. The AP2 family also acts as a tumor suppressor. Here we found that p73 and AP2 are able to activate NEU4, a neuraminidase gene, which removes the terminal sialic acid residues from cancer-associated glycans. Under serum starvation, NEU4 was up-regulated and one of the NEU4 target glycans, sialyl Lewis X, was decreased, whereas p73 and AP2 were up-regulated. Sialyl Lewis X levels were not, however, decreased under starvation conditions in p73- or AP2-knockdown cells. p53 and AP2 underwent protein-protein interactions, exerting synergistic effects to activate p21, and interaction of p53 with AP2 was lost in cells expressing the L350P mutation of p53. The homologous residues in p63 and p73 are L423 and L377, respectively. The synergistic effect of p53/p63 with AP2 to activate genes was lost with the L350P/L423P mutation in p53/p63, but p73 bearing the L377P mutation was able to interact with AP2 and exerted its normal synergistic effects. We propose that p73 and AP2 synergistically activate the NEU4 promoter in colon cancer cells. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Nanoparticles prepared by single emulsion method had a size of less than 300 nm with 70.7 ± 3.9% reaction yield and 26.4 ± 1.1% Hsp loading capacity. Treatment of C6 glioma cells with HspNPs for 24 and 48 h resulted in dose- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability, with approximate IC50 of 28 and 21 μg/mL, respectively (p = .036 for 24 h, p = .025 for 48 h). The percentage of PCNA positive cells decreased to 20% and 10%, respectively, for Hsp- and HspNP-treated cells at concentration of 100 µg/mL. Treatment with increasing concentrations of HspNPs (25, 50, 75 and 100 µg/mL) resulted in 9.1-, 7-, 12.5- and 12.7-fold in increase in apoptotic cell number. Optimum doses of Hsp and HspNPs were found to increase oxidative damage in C6 glioma cells. MDA levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were found to be significantly elevated at 75 and 100 µg/mL exposure concentration of HspNPs with (p = .002) and (p = .018), respectively for 48-h treatment. The results obtained with this study showed biocompatible polymeric nanoparticle systems has great advantages to enhance anti-cancer activity and poor solubility of therapeutic agents. Overall our findings suggest that Hsp-loaded PLGA nanoparticle systems showed significant anti-cancer activity and HspNPs could be used as promising novel anti-cancer agent." ;

GO exhibits pH-dependent fluorescence emission in the visible/near-infrared, providing a possibility of molecular imaging and pH-sensing. It is also water soluble and has a substantial platform for functionalization, allowing for the delivery of multiple therapeutics. GO physical properties are modified to enhance cellular internalization, producing fluorescent nanoflakes with low (<15%) cytotoxicity at the imaging concentrations of 15 μg/mL. As a result, at lower flake sizes GO rapidly internalizes into HeLa cells with the following 70% fluorescence based clearance at 24 h, assessed by its characteristic emission in red/near-IR. pH-dependence of GO emission is utilized to provide the sensing of acidic extracellular environments of cancer cells. The results demonstrate diminishing green/red (550/630 nm) fluorescence intensity ratios for HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells in comparison to HEK-293 healthy cells suggesting a potential use of GO as a non-invasive optical sensor for cancer microenvironments.

There have been many attempts to identify markers and key pathways induced throughout EMT but the process is complex and depends on the cancer type and tumour microenvironment. Here we used the colon cancer cell line HT29, which stably overexpressed Snail, the key transcription factor in early EMT, as a model for colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with a pro-metastatic phenotype. We investigated miRNA expression regulation during that phenotypic switching. We found that overexpression of Snail in HT29 cells triggered significant changes in individual miRNA levels but did not change the global efficiency of miRNA processing. Snail abundance repressed the expression of miR-192 and miR-194 and increased miR-205, let-7i and SNORD13 levels. These identified changes correlated with the reported transcriptomic alterations in Snail-overexpressing HT29 cells. We also investigated how Snail affected the miRNA content of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from HT29 cells. Our data suggest that the presence of Snail significantly alters the complex mRNA/miRNA interactions in the early steps of metastasis and also has an impact on the content of EVs released from HT29 cells. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

This retrospective case-control study compared patients who had lung cancer with PJP (n = 112) or without PJP (n = 336) matched according to age, sex, histopathology, and stage. PJP definition was based on (i) positive PCR or direct immunofluorescence results for pneumocystis, (ii) clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities that were consistent with a pneumonic process, and (iii) received targeted PJP treatment. The development of PJP was associated with radiotherapy (RTx), concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRTx), lymphopenia, and prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (20 mg of prednisolone equivalent per day for ≥3 weeks). Multivariate analysis revealed independent associations with prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06–3.63; p = 0.032) and CCRTx (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.27–3.43; p = 0.004). Steroid use was frequently related to RTx pneumonitis or esophagitis (29 patients, 43.3%). Prolonged high-dose steroid therapy and CCRTx were risk factors for PJP development among patients with lung cancer. As these patients had a poor prognosis, clinicians should consider PJP prophylaxis for high-risk patients with lung cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

We performed an in silico analysis to determine the concordance in the frequencies of actionable mutations and copy number alterations/aberrations (CNAs) in the two most common breast cancer histologies, invasive lobular and invasive ductal carcinoma. We found that targeted sequencing identified a larger number of mutational hotspots and clinically significant amplifications that would have been missed by WES and SNP arrays in many actionable genes such as PIK3CA, EGFR, AKT3, FGFR1, ERBB2, ERBB3 and ESR1. The striking differences between the number of mutational hotspots and CNAs generated from these platforms highlight a number of factors that should be considered in the interpretation of array and NGS-based genomic data for precision medicine.

Several oxaliplatin transporters were previously identified but their relative contributions to determining oxaliplatin tumour responses and gastrointestinal tumour cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin remains unclear. We studied clinical associations between tumour expression of oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes and patient response to oxaliplatin, then experimentally verified associations found with MRP2 in models of human gastrointestinal cancer. Among 18 oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes, MRP2 was the only one to be differentially expressed in the tumours of colorectal cancer patients who did or did not respond to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Over-expression of MRP2 (endogenously in HepG2 and PANC-1 cells, or induced by stable transfection of HEK293 cells) decreased oxaliplatin accumulation and cytotoxicity but those deficits were reversed by inhibition of MRP2 with myricetin or siRNA knockdown. Mice bearing subcutaneous HepG2 tumour xenografts were sensitised to oxaliplatin antitumour activity by concurrent myricetin treatment with little or no increase in toxicity. In conclusion, MRP2 limits oxaliplatin accumulation and response in human gastrointestinal cancer.

We compare optimized gene signatures for cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin responses in the same cell lines and validate each signature using data from patients with cancer. Supervised support vector machine learning is used to derive gene sets whose expression is related to the cell line GI50 values by backwards feature selection with cross-validation. Specific genes and functional pathways distinguishing sensitive from resistant cell lines are identified by contrasting signatures obtained at extreme and median GI50 thresholds. Ensembles of gene signatures at different thresholds are combined to reduce the dependence on specific GI50 values for predicting drug responses. The most accurate gene signatures for each platin are: cisplatin: BARD1, BCL2, BCL2L1, CDKN2C, FAAP24, FEN1, MAP3K1, MAPK13, MAPK3, NFKB1, NFKB2, SLC22A5, SLC31A2, TLR4, and TWIST1; carboplatin: AKT1, EIF3K, ERCC1, GNGT1, GSR, MTHFR, NEDD4L, NLRP1, NRAS, RAF1, SGK1, TIGD1, TP53, VEGFB, and VEGFC; and oxaliplatin: BRAF, FCGR2A, IGF1, MSH2, NAGK, NFE2L2, NQO1, PANK3, SLC47A1, SLCO1B1, and UGT1A1. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with bladder, ovarian, and colorectal cancer were used to test the cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin signatures, resulting in 71.0%, 60.2%, and 54.5% accuracies in predicting disease recurrence and 59%, 61%, and 72% accuracies in predicting remission, respectively. One cisplatin signature predicted 100% of recurrence in non-smoking patients with bladder cancer (57% disease-free; N = 19), and 79% recurrence in smokers (62% disease-free; N = 35).

MTH1 dephosphorylates oxidized nucleotides, thereby preventing their incorporation into DNA and protecting tumour cells from oxidative DNA damage. Inhibitors of MTH1 (TH588 and (S)-crizotinib) were shown to reduce cancer cell viability. However, the MTH1-dependency of the anti-cancer effects of these drugs has recently been questioned. Here, we have assessed anti-tumour effects of TH588 and (S)-crizotinib in patient-derived 3D colorectal cancer cultures. Hypoxia and reoxygenation – conditions that increase intracellular ROS levels – increased sensitivity to (S)-crizotinib, but not to TH588. (S)-crizotinib reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-MET and ErbB3 whereas TH588 induced a mitotic cell cycle arrest, which was not affected by adding ROS-modulating compounds. Furthermore, we show that both compounds induced DNA damage that could not be prevented by adding the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Moreover, adding ROS-modulating compounds did not alter the reduction in viability in response to TH588 and (S)-crizotinib. We conclude that TH588 and (S)-crizotinib have very clear and distinct anti-tumour effects in 3D colorectal cancer cultures, but that these effects most likely occur through distinct and ROS-independent mechanisms. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Iron deposits are a phenotypic trait of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Histological iron imaging and contrast-agent free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect these deposits, but their presence in human cancer, and correlation with immunotherapeutic response is largely untested. Here, primarily using these iron imaging approaches, we evaluated the spatial distribution of polarized macrophage populations containing high endogenous levels of iron in preclinical murine models and human breast cancer, and used them as metabolic biomarkers to correlate TAM infiltration with response to immunotherapy in preclinical trials. Macrophage-targeted inhibition of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) by immunotherapy was confirmed to inhibit macrophage accumulation and slow mammary tumor growth in mouse models while also reducing hemosiderin iron-laden TAM accumulation as measured by both iron histology and in vivo iron MRI (FeMRI). Spatial profiling of TAM iron deposit infiltration defined regions of maximal accumulation and response to the CSF1R inhibitor, and revealed differences between microenvironments of human cancer according to levels of polarized macrophage iron accumulation in stromal margins. We therefore demonstrate that iron deposition serves as an endogenous metabolic imaging biomarker of TAM infiltration in breast cancer that has high translational potential for evaluation of immunotherapeutic response. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "More than 50% of colon cancers bear mutations in p53, one of the most important tumor suppressors, and its family members p63 or p73 are expected to contribute to inhibiting the progression of colon cancers. The AP2 family also acts as a tumor suppressor. Here we found that p73 and AP2 are able to activate NEU4, a neuraminidase gene, which removes the terminal sialic acid residues from cancer-associated glycans. Under serum starvation, NEU4 was up-regulated and one of the NEU4 target glycans, sialyl Lewis X, was decreased, whereas p73 and AP2 were up-regulated. Sialyl Lewis X levels were not, however, decreased under starvation conditions in p73- or AP2-knockdown cells. p53 and AP2 underwent protein-protein interactions, exerting synergistic effects to activate p21, and interaction of p53 with AP2 was lost in cells expressing the L350P mutation of p53. The homologous residues in p63 and p73 are L423 and L377, respectively. The synergistic effect of p53/p63 with AP2 to activate genes was lost with the L350P/L423P mutation in p53/p63, but p73 bearing the L377P mutation was able to interact with AP2 and exerted its normal synergistic effects. We propose that p73 and AP2 synergistically activate the NEU4 promoter in colon cancer cells. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Nanoparticles prepared by single emulsion method had a size of less than 300 nm with 70.7 ± 3.9% reaction yield and 26.4 ± 1.1% Hsp loading capacity. Treatment of C6 glioma cells with HspNPs for 24 and 48 h resulted in dose- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability, with approximate IC50 of 28 and 21 μg/mL, respectively (p = .036 for 24 h, p = .025 for 48 h). The percentage of PCNA positive cells decreased to 20% and 10%, respectively, for Hsp- and HspNP-treated cells at concentration of 100 µg/mL. Treatment with increasing concentrations of HspNPs (25, 50, 75 and 100 µg/mL) resulted in 9.1-, 7-, 12.5- and 12.7-fold in increase in apoptotic cell number. Optimum doses of Hsp and HspNPs were found to increase oxidative damage in C6 glioma cells. MDA levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were found to be significantly elevated at 75 and 100 µg/mL exposure concentration of HspNPs with (p = .002) and (p = .018), respectively for 48-h treatment. The results obtained with this study showed biocompatible polymeric nanoparticle systems has great advantages to enhance anti-cancer activity and poor solubility of therapeutic agents. Overall our findings suggest that Hsp-loaded PLGA nanoparticle systems showed significant anti-cancer activity and HspNPs could be used as promising novel anti-cancer agent." ;

GO exhibits pH-dependent fluorescence emission in the visible/near-infrared, providing a possibility of molecular imaging and pH-sensing. It is also water soluble and has a substantial platform for functionalization, allowing for the delivery of multiple therapeutics. GO physical properties are modified to enhance cellular internalization, producing fluorescent nanoflakes with low (<15%) cytotoxicity at the imaging concentrations of 15 μg/mL. As a result, at lower flake sizes GO rapidly internalizes into HeLa cells with the following 70% fluorescence based clearance at 24 h, assessed by its characteristic emission in red/near-IR. pH-dependence of GO emission is utilized to provide the sensing of acidic extracellular environments of cancer cells. The results demonstrate diminishing green/red (550/630 nm) fluorescence intensity ratios for HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells in comparison to HEK-293 healthy cells suggesting a potential use of GO as a non-invasive optical sensor for cancer microenvironments. The results of this work demonstrate the potential of GO as a novel multifunctional platform for therapeutic delivery, biological imaging and cancer sensing. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Patients with primary cervical cancer and newly diagnosed were selected from ten different cancer specialist hospitals of Malaysia. Patients’ demographic and clinical data were obtained for the prognostic analysis. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate patients’ survival time (CSS and OS) with DM status and values were compared using the log-rank test. A total of 19,785 newly diagnosed CC patients were registered during 2010–2016, among them only 16,946 (85.6%) with primary CC tumor. There was no difference in treatment modality between DM and non-DM patients. However intergroup assessment showed that type 2DM have significantly higher rate of mortality in both overall mortality (28.3%) and CC-specific (11.7%) as compared to Type 1DM (17.3%; 5.5%) and non DM patients (12.7%; 9.1%) (p < 0.001). Within group assessments showed that Type 2DM patients have better quality of life (mean 7.13 ± 3.67) (p < 0.001) and less distress levels (mean 2.41 ± 0.63) (p < 0.011) as compared to type1 DM (meant 10.54 ± 2.11; 3.19 ± 1.07).

In order to tackle cancer heterogeneity and comply with the data dimensionality, a number of network and pathway approaches were invented but rarely systematically applied to this task. We propose a new method, called NEAmarker, for finding sensitive and robust biomarkers at the pathway level. scores from network enrichment analysis transform the original space of altered genes into a lower-dimensional space of pathways. These dimensions are then correlated with phenotype variables. The method was first tested using in vitro data from three anti-cancer drug screens and then on clinical data of The Cancer Genome Atlas. It proved superior to the single-gene and alternative enrichment analyses in terms of (1) universal applicability to different data types with a possibility of cross-platform integration, (2) consistency of the discovered correlates between independent drug screens, and (3) ability to explain differential survival of treated patients. Our new screen of anti-cancer compounds validated the performance of multivariate models of drug sensitivity. The previously proposed methods of enrichment analysis could achieve comparable levels of performance in certain tests. However, only our method could discover predictors of both in vitro response and patient survival given administration of the same drug. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

SPIONs entrapped in the core of the nanocomplex may act as a hyperthermia agent and generate localized heat upon excitation with an alternating magnetic field (AMF), thus enabling a thermo-chemotherapy strategy for cancer treatment. Accordingly, the cytotoxic effect and the mode of cell death triggered by the nanocomplex in combination with AMF were evaluated on two different cancer cell lines with various folate receptor (FR) expression levels, including KB nasopharyngeal cancer cells overexpressing FRs as the model and MCF-7 breast cancer cells with low level of FRs as the blank sample. The obtained results showed that KB cell death was greater than the cell death observed in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, a majority of cell death in both cell lines were related to apoptosis when the folate-modified nanocomplex was used instated of the non-folate-modified nanocomplex. Therefore, functionalizing the nanocomplex with folate modulated the response to thermo-chemotherapy by shifting the cell death pathways toward apoptosis." ;

This cohort study included 128 HER2-positive breast cancer who received NAC with trastuzumab. TILs grading of the tumor stroma in pretreatment biopsy specimens and residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab was categorized as low, intermediate, and high based on the criteria of the International Working Group. In current study, the pCR rate was 64.8%, and the Relapse-free survival (RFS) was significantly worse in the non-pCR group than in the pCR group. The pCR rate correlated with the TILs grade in pretreatment tumors. In 45 non-pCR patients, TILs grade was higher in the residual tumors than in the pretreatment tumors. The RFS was significantly better in residual tumors with high TILs grade than those with low TILs grade (p = 0.033). In conclusion, assessment of the TILs grade in residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab might be necessary to determine patients with good prognosis among those who do not achieve pCR. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Most targeting strategies of anticancer drug delivery systems (DDSs) rely on the surface functionalization of nanocarriers with specific ligands, which trigger the internalization in cancer cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The endocytosis implies the entrapment of DDSs in acidic vesicles (endosomes and lysosomes) and their eventual ejection by exocytosis. This process, intrinsic to eukaryotic cells, is one of the main drawbacks of DDSs because it reduces the drug bioavailability in the intracellular environment. The escape of DDSs from the acidic vesicles is, therefore, crucial to enhance the therapeutic performance at low drug dose. To this end, we developed a multifunctionalized DDS that combines high specificity towards cancer cells with endosomal escape capabilities. Doxorubicin-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles were functionalized with polyethylenimine, a polymer commonly used to induce endosomal rupture, and hyaluronic acid, which binds to CD44 receptors, overexpressed in cancer cells. We show irrefutable proof that the developed DDS can escape the endosomal pathway upon polymeric functionalization. Interestingly, the combination of the two polymers resulted in higher endosomal escape efficiency than the polyethylenimine coating alone. Hyaluronic acid additionally provides the system with cancer targeting capability and enzymatically controlled drug release. Thanks to this multifunctionality, the engineered DDS had cytotoxicity comparable to the pure drug whilst displaying high specificity towards cancer cells. The polymeric engineering here developed enhances the performance of DDS at low drug dose, holding great potential for anticancer therapeutic applications. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The use of oncolytic viruses (OVs) for cancer treatment is emerging as a successful strategy that combines the direct, targeted killing of the cancer with the induction of a long-lasting anti-tumor immune response. Using multiple aggressive murine models of triple-negative breast cancer, we have recently demonstrated that the early administration of oncolytic Maraba virus (MRB) prior to surgical resection of the primary tumor is sufficient to minimize the metastatic burden, protect against tumor rechallenge, cure a fraction of the mice and sensitize refractory tumors to immune checkpoint blockade without the need for further treatment. Here, we apply our surgical model to other OVs: Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Adenovirus (Ad), Reovirus (Reo) and Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and show that all of the tested OVs could positively change the outcome of the treated animals. The growth of the primary and secondary tumors was differently affected by the various OVs and most of the viruses conferred survival benefits in this neoadjuvant setting despite the absence of direct treatment following rechallenge. This study establishes that OV-therapy confers long-term protection when administered in the pre-operative window of opportunity. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase is overexpressed in approximately 15–20% of breast tumors and associated with aggressive disease and poor clinical outcome. p130Cas represents a nodal scaffold protein regulating cell survival, migration and proliferation in normal and pathological contexts. p130Cas overexpression in ErbB2 human breast cancer correlates with poor prognosis and metastasis formation. Recent data indicate that p130Cas association to ErbB2 protects ErbB2 from degradation, thus enhancing tumorigenesis. Therefore, inhibiting p130Cas/ErbB2 interaction might represent a new therapeutic strategy to target breast cancer. Here we demonstrate by performing Molecular Modeling, Molecular Dynamics, dot blot, ELISA and fluorescence quenching experiments, that p130Cas binds directly to ErbB2. Then, by structure-based virtual screening, we identified two potential inhibitors of p130Cas/ErbB2 interaction. Their experimental validation was performed in vitro and in ErbB2-positive breast cancer cellular models. The results highlight that both compounds interfere with p130Cas/ErbB2 binding and significantly affect cell proliferation and sensitivity to Trastuzumab. Overall, this study identifies p130Cas/ErbB2 complex as a potential breast cancer target revealing new therapeutic perspectives for protein-protein interaction (PPI). © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Gastric cancer (GC) ranks as the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, and approximately 42% of all cases diagnosed each year worldwide are diagnosed in China. A large number of clinical applications have revealed that Trametes robiniophila Μurr. (Huaier) exhibits an anti-tumour effect. However, loss of the bioactive components of Huaier during the extraction procedure with water is unavoidable, and the underlying mechanism of the anti-cancer effect of Huaier remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer effect of Huaier n-butanol extract, which contained 51.4% total flavonoids, on HGC27, MGC803, and AGS human GC cell lines in vitro. At a low concentration, Huaier n-butanol extract inhibited the growth of these GC cell types, induced cell cycle arrest and reduced cell metastasis. Moreover, Huaier n-butanol extract suppressed the c-Myc-Bmi1 signalling pathway, and overexpression of Bmi1 reversed the effects of Huaier n-butanol extract on GC cells. Thus, our findings indicate that Huaier n-butanol extract suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of GC cells via a c-Myc-Bmi1-mediated approach, providing a new perspective for our understanding of the anti-tumour effects of Huaier. These results suggest that Huaier n-butanol extract could be an attractive therapeutic adjuvant for the treatment of human GC. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

In the present study, we screened the anticancer potential of supernatant metabolites from eight native haloarchaeal strains obtained from a culture collection in Iran. Five human cancer cell lines including breast, lung, prostate and also human fibroblast cells as the normal control were used in the present study. Moreover, to evaluate the anti-tumor effect of the selected supernatant, inhibition of sphere formation and tumor development was assessed in-vitro and in-vivo, respectively. Among all strains, supernatant metabolites from Halobacterium salinarum IBRC M10715 had the most potent cytotoxic effect on prostate cancer cell lines (IC50 = 0.5 mg/mL) without any effects on normal cells. It significantly increased both early and late apoptosis (about 11% and 9%, respectively) in the androgen-dependent PC3 cell line, reduced sphere formation ability of DU145 and PC3 cells with down-regulation of SOX2 gene expression. Furthermore, our results revealed that tumors developed in nude mice significantly shrank post intratumor injection of metabolites of the haloarchaeal strain. In conclusion, we suggested here for the first time that supernatant metabolites from Halobacterium salinarum IBRC M10715 could be a novel component against prostate cancer in-vitro and in-vivo with remarkable reduction in stem-like properties of tumor. © 2018, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

The main HNSCC risk factors are tobacco, excessive alcohol use, and the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV positive (+) cancers are etiologically different from other HNSCC and often show better prognosis. The current knowledge regarding HNSCC miRNA profiles is still incomplete especially in the context of HPV+ cancer. Thus, we analyzed 61 freshly collected primary oral (OSCC) and oropharyngeal (OPSCC) SCC samples. HPV DNA and RNA was found in 21% cases. The Illumina whole-genome small-RNA profiling by next-generation sequencing was done on 22 samples and revealed 7 specific miRNAs to HPV+ OSCC, 77 to HPV+ OPSCC, and additional 3 shared with both; 51 miRNAs were specific to HPV− OPSCC, 62 to HPV− OSCC, and 31 shared with both. The results for 9 miRNAs (miR-9, -21, -29a, -100, -106b, -143 and -145) were assessed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction on the whole study population. The data was additionally confirmed by reanalyzing publicly available miRNA sequencing Cancer Genome Atlas consortium (TCGA) HNSCC data. Cell signaling pathway analysis revealed differences between HPV+ and HPV− HNSCC. Our findings compared with literature data revealed extensive heterogeneity of miRNA deregulation with only several miRNAs consistently affected, and miR-9 being the most likely HPV related miRNA. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Development of combined therapies constitutes an effective strategy to inhibit cancer cells and prevent the emergence of drug resistance. For this purpose, we investigated the anti-tumoral effect of thirteen phenolic compounds, from the Tunisian quince Cydonia oblonga Miller, alone or combined to 5-FU, on the human 5-FU-resistant LS174-R colon cancer cells in comparison to parental cells. Our results showed that only Kaempferol was able to chemo-sensitize 5-FU-resistant LS174-R cells. This phenolic compound combined with 5-FU exerted synergistic inhibitory effect on cell viability. This combination enhanced the apoptosis and induced cell cycle arrest of both chemo-resistant and sensitive cells through impacting the expression levels of different cellular effectors. Kaempferol also blocked the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and modulated the expression of JAK/STAT3, MAPK, PI3K/AKT and NF-κB. In silico docking analysis suggested that the potent anti-tumoral effect of Kaempferol, compared to its two analogs (Kaempferol 3-O-glucoside and Kampferol 3-O-rutinoside), can be explained by the absence of glucosyl groups. Overall, our data propose Kaempferol as a potential chemotherapeutic agent to be used alone or in combination with 5-FU to overcome colon cancer drug resistance. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Considering the high prevalence and mortality rate of colorectal cancer, in this study we tried to design and validate a standard printed form and evaluate oncologists’ and nurses’ adherence to this form. This cross-sectional study was performed in Omid hospital, Mashhad, Iran from January 2015 to October 2015. A Chemotherapy form including various demographic and clinical parameters and approved chemotherapy regimens for colorectal cancer was designed by the clinical pharmacist and validated by clinical oncologists working in this center. All eligible patients admitted in this center during this period of time were included in the study. Adherence of the oncologists and nurses to this form and probable medication errors were identified by the pharmacy student. Sixty-seven patients with colorectal cancer and a total of 251 chemotherapy courses were evaluated. All patients received regimens compatible with developed form but in 206 courses (98.56%) of chemotherapy dosing error happened and in most of cases patients received lower than calculated dose (37.8%). Three errors occurred in administration step by nurses which they infused the medication in shorter than recommended duration. In general, oncologists’ adherence with developed form for chemotherapy of colorectal cancer was relatively high, except in dose calculation. Avoiding from rounding the calculated medications’ doses and precise calculation of patients’ body surface area can prevent most of medication errors and reduce risk of adverse drug reaction occurrence. © 2018, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

Nevertheless, the importance of transfusion timing is still unclear. The primary purpose of this study is to appraise whether the receipt of intraoperative blood transfusion (BT) differ from postoperative BT in regards to cancer outcomes in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients treated with nephrectomy. Data on 1168 patients with RCC, who underwent radical or partial nephrectomy as primary therapy between 1988–2013 were analyzed. PBT was defined as transfusion of allogeneic red blood cells (RBC) during surgery or the postsurgical period. Survival was analyzed and compared using the Kaplan–Meier method with the log-rank test. Of 1168 patients, 198 patients (16.9%) received a PBT. Including 117 intraoperative BT and 81 postoperative BT. Only 21 (10.6%) patients required both intraoperative and postoperative BT. On multivariate analyses, receipt of PBT was associated with significantly worse local disease recurrence (HR: 2.4; P = 0.017), metastatic progression (HR: 2.7; P = 0.005), cancer-specific mortality (HR: 3.5; P = 0.002) and all-cause mortality (HR: 2.1; P = 0.005). Nevertheless, postoperative BT was not independently associated with increased risk of local recurrence (p = 0.1), metastatic progression (P = 0.16) or kidney cancer death (P = 0.63), yet did significantly increase the risk of overall mortality (HR: 2.6; P = 0.004).

For this reason novel therapies accounting for PDAC peculiarities, such as the relevant stromal reaction, are urgently needed. Here adipose mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (AD-MSC) have been armed to constantly release a soluble trimeric and multimeric variant of the known anti-cancer TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (sTRAIL). This cancer gene therapy strategy was in vitro challenged demonstrating that sTRAIL was thermally stable and able to induce apoptosis in the PDAC lines BxPC-3, MIA PaCa-2 and against primary PDAC cells. sTRAIL released by AD-MSC relocated into the tumor stroma was able to significantly counteract tumor growth in vivo with a significant reduction in tumor size, in cytokeratin-7+ cells and by an anti-angiogenic effect. In parallel, histology on PDAC specimens form patients (n = 19) was performed to investigate the levels of TRAIL DR4, DR5 and OPG receptors generating promising insights on the possible clinical translation of our approach. These results indicate that adipose MSC can very efficiently vehicle a novel TRAIL variant opening unexplored opportunities for PDAC treatment. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Malignant melanoma is one of the untreatable cancers in which conventional therapeutic strategies, including chemotherapy, are hardly effective. Therefore, identification of novel therapeutic targets involved in melanoma progression is urgently needed for developing effective therapeutic methods. Overexpression of interleukin-13 receptor α2 (IL13Rα2) is observed in several cancer types including glioma and pancreatic cancer. Although IL13Rα2 is implicated in the progression of various types of cancer, its expression and roles in the malignant melanoma have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we showed that IL13Rα2 was expressed in approximately 7.5% melanoma patients. While IL13Rα2 expression in human melanoma cells decreased their proliferation in vitro, it promoted in vivo tumour growth and angiogenesis in melanoma xenograft mouse model. We also found that the expression of amphiregulin, a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, was correlated with IL13Rα2 expression in cultured melanoma cells, xenograft tumour tissues and melanoma clinical samples. Furthermore, expression of amphiregulin promoted tumour growth, implicating causal relationship between the expression of IL13Rα2 and amphiregulin. These results suggest that IL13Rα2 enhances tumorigenicity by inducing angiogenesis in malignant melanoma, and serves as a potential therapeutic target of malignant melanoma. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

However, its prognostic value and the underlying mechanism in lung cancer remains unclear. Herein we evaluated the expression of PKD2 in lung adenocarcinoma and investigated its relationship with EMT. GSEA, TCGA and K-M plotter database were applied and revealed that high PKD2 expression predicted poor outcome and related with lymph nodes metastasis in lung cancer. IHC and qRT-PCR were performed and found PKD2 was elevated in lung adenocarcinoma and negatively related with OS (p = 0.015), PFS (p = 0.006) and the level of E-cadherin (p = 0.021). Experiment in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines demonstrated up-regulation of PKD2 led to high expression of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vim, mmp9 et al.) and EMT transcription factors(zeb1, twist, snail), and the results were reversed when PKD2 was knocked down. Further investigation showed that abrogation of PKD2 inhibited A549 cell migration, invasion, proliferation and induced cell arrest in G2/M phase. We concluded that high expression of PKD2 was associated with poor prognosis and cancer progression in lung adenocarcinoma patients by promoting EMT. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

We showed for the first time that Raman imaging can be used to distinguish successfully between glycosylated and nonglycosylated proteins in normal and cancer tissue. Thousands of protein, lipid and glycan species exist in cells and tissues and their metabolism is monitored via numerous pathways, networks and methods. The metabolism can change in response to cellular environment alterations, such as development of a disease. Measuring such alterations and understanding the pathways involved are crucial to fully understand cellular metabolism in cancer development. In this paper Raman markers of glycogen, glycosaminoglycan, chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate proteoglycan were identified based on their vibrational signatures. High spatial resolution of Raman imaging combined with chemometrics allows separation of individual species from many chemical components present in each cell. We have found that metabolism of proteins, lipids and glycans is markedly deregulated in breast (adenocarcinoma) and brain (medulloblastoma) tumors. We have identified two glycoforms in the normal breast tissue and the malignant brain tissue in contrast to the breast cancer tissue where only one glycoform has been identified. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Very recently, we postulated that the incorporation of citral into nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC-Citral) improves solubility and delivery of the citral without toxic effects in vivo. Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate anti-cancer effects of NLC-Citral in MDA MB-231 cells in vitro through the Annexin V, cell cycle, JC-1 and fluorometric assays. Additionally, this study is aimed to effects of NLC-Citral in reducing the tumor weight and size in 4T1 induced murine breast cancer model. Results showed that NLC-Citral induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest in MDA MB-231 cells. Furthermore, a prominent anti-metastatic ability of NLC-Citral was demonstrated in vitro using scratch, migration and invasion assays. A significant reduction of migrated and invaded cells was observed in the NLC-Citral treated MDA MB-231 cells. To further evaluate the apoptotic and anti-metastatic mechanism of NLC-Citral at the molecular level, microarray-based gene expression and proteomic profiling were conducted. Based on the result obtained, NLC-Citral was found to regulate several important signaling pathways related to cancer development such as apoptosis, cell cycle, and metastasis signaling pathways. Additionally, gene expression analysis was validated through the targeted RNA sequencing and real-time polymerase chain reaction. In conclusion, the NLC-Citral inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells in vitro, majorly through the induction of apoptosis, anti-metastasis, anti-angiogenesis potentials, and reducing the tumor weight and size without altering the therapeutic effects of citral. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The incidence of developing cancer should increase with the body mass, yet is not the case, a conundrum referred to as Peto’s paradox. Elephants have a lower incidence of cancer suggesting that these animals have probably evolved different ways to protect themselves against the disease. The paradox is worth revisiting with the realization that most mammals encode an endogenous APOBEC3 cytidine deaminase capable of mutating single stranded DNA. Indeed, the mutagenic activity of some APOBEC3 enzymes has been shown to introduce somatic mutations into genomic DNA. These enzymes are now recognized as causal agent responsible for the accumulation of CG- > TA transitions and DNA breaks leading to chromosomal rearrangements in human cancer genomes. Here, we identified an elephant A3Z1 gene, related to human APOBEC3A and showed that it could efficiently deaminate cytidine, 5-methylcytidine and produce DNA breaks leading to massive apoptosis, similar to other mammalian APOBEC3A enzymes where body mass varies by up to four orders of magnitude. Consequently, it could be considered that eAZ1 might contribute to cancer in elephants in a manner similar to their proposed role in humans. If so, eAZ1 might be particularly well regulated to counter Peto’s paradox. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

The cells and mitochondria were isolated from cancerous and non-cancerous ovarian tissues and exposed to IC 50 concentration of F1 fraction for evaluation of mitochondrial and cellular parameters. Our results showed that F1 fraction of T. coronatus crude extract significantly induced toxic effects only in the cancerous ovarian mitochondria, including increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, mitochondrial swelling, and cytochrome c release.Flow-cytometry analysis demonstrated that F1 fraction of T. coronatus progressively induced apoptosis and necrosis only on EOC but not non-cancerous cells.

Biotin-PEG-PCL polymers have been used for targeted drug delivery to cancer, as well as to improve the pharmacokinetics of the drug and reduce its effects. In this study, biotin-conjugated copolymers were fabricated with polymerization of the ring opening method and the properties of copolymer and nanoparticles were investigated using various techniques. The toxicity of artemisinin and its nanoparticles have been investigated on MCF-7 and normal HFF2 cells. The results showed that the encapsulation efficacy of artemisinin in nanoparticles was 45.5 ± 0.41%. The release profile of the drug indicates that the release is slow and controlled and is approximately pH dependent. The results of artemisinin cell culture on human breast cancer cells showed that biotin-PEG-PCL nanoparticles had an inhibitory effect on MCF-7 cells and had no toxic effects on HFF2 cells. Anticancer activity in vivo in the 4T1 breast cancer model showed that tumour volumes were decreased up 40 mm3 by ART-loaded micelles and 76 mm3 by free ART, compared to the control group (2150 mm). In vivo results showed that this formulation significantly increases the accumulation of substances in the tumours. Therefore, the molecular formulation of ART-based copolymers can be a desirable process for cancer treatment purposes. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group." ;

Previous reports have shown the effectiveness of BP in treating cancer diseases. However, BP has no targeting capacity towards specific cancer cells. To improve treatment efficiency and reduce the dose of BP used in cancer treatment, targeting-based approaches should be developed. In the present study, we used riboflavin-5′-phosphate (RFMP) immobilized iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4 MNPs) as carriers for BP to treat cancer cell lines derived from liver, prostate and breast. These model cancer cells overexpress riboflavin receptors on their cell membrane and are also sensitive to BP treatment. Thus, BP-binding free RFMP on MNPs can be used as probes to target these model cells, whereas BP can be readily released on target cancer cells. Cell viability was twofold lower by using Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs immobilized with BP than that achieved by using free-form BP at a similar amount. Moreover, BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs have no apparent harmful effects on non-target cells. In addition, we evaluated the level of cysteine-aspartic acid protease 3 (caspase 3) in the resultant cell lysate obtained after treatment by BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs to demonstrate that apoptosis is mainly involved in the growth inhibition of target cells. © 2017, © 2017 The Author(s).

Patients with laryngeal cancer (ICD-10: C32) between 2009 and 2010 were retrospectively identified and tracked until 2015 using the Korean Health Insurance claims database. During the seven-year follow-up period, 5,322 subjects were newly diagnosed with larynx cancer. The mean age of people with laryngeal cancer was much higher than those without (63.29 vs. 47.7 years, p < 0.0001), and the incidence of larynx cancer in men was much higher than that in women (93.16% vs. 6.84%, p < 0.0001). Age, gender, smoking status, alcohol intake, and exercise-adjusted hazard ratios indicated that participants with MetS had a 1.13-fold higher hazard of having larynx cancer than those without MetS. The number of MetS components was a strong risk factor for laryngeal cancer with a higher risk estimate of this cancer in both ex- and current smokers as well as people who have never smoked. MetS was found to be an independent risk factor for the incidence of laryngeal cancer.

        fabio:abstract    "Chromosome changes are one of the hallmarks of human malignancies. Chromosomal rearrangement is frequent in human cancers. One of the consequences of chromosomal rearrangement is gene fusions in the cancer genome. We have previously identified a panel of fusion genes in aggressive prostate cancers. In this study, we showed that 6 of these fusion genes are present in 7 different types of human malignancies with variable frequencies. Among them, the CCNH-C5orf30 and TRMT11-GRIK2 gene fusions were found in breast cancer, colon cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, ovarian cancer and liver cancer, with frequencies ranging from 12.9% to 85%. In contrast, four other gene fusions (mTOR-TP53BP1, TMEM135-CCDC67, KDM4-AC011523.2 and LRRC59-FLJ60017) are less frequent. Both TRMT11-GRIK2 and CCNH-C5orf30 are also frequently present in lymph node metastatic cancer samples from the breast, colon and ovary. Thus, detecting these fusion transcripts may have significant biological and clinical implications in cancer patient management. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Quantifying the genetic correlation between cancers can provide important insights into the mechanisms driving cancer etiology. Using genome-wide association study summary statistics across six cancer types based on a total of 296,215 cases and 301,319 controls of European ancestry, here we estimate the pair-wise genetic correlations between breast, colorectal, head/neck, lung, ovary and prostate cancer, and between cancers and 38 other diseases. We observed statistically significant genetic correlations between lung and head/neck cancer (r g = 0.57, p = 4.6 × 10 −8 ), breast and ovarian cancer (r g = 0.24, p = 7 × 10 −5 ), breast and lung cancer (r g = 0.18, p =1.5 × 10 −6 ) and breast and colorectal cancer (r g = 0.15, p = 1.1 × 10 −4 ). We also found that multiple cancers are genetically correlated with non-cancer traits including smoking, psychiatric diseases and metabolic characteristics.

        fabio:abstract    "Purpose: Several previous studies have shown that oral bisphosphonates (BPs) are associated with the incidence of 13 specific cancers, including lung cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the findings are heterogeneous. Methods and results: Relevant studies published in databases such as PubMed, Embase database, and Cochrane library were systematically retrieved from inception to August 25th, 2017, regardless of language, by two investigators independently. Afterwards, the maximum adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted from the retrieved studies. Finally, 13 cohort studies involving 1,510,763 participants were enrolled into this meta-analysis. No significant relationship was found between oral BPs and the risk of all-cause cancer in osteoporosis (OP) patients among the entire population (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80–1.18; I 2 92.5%). Besides, oral BPs could remarkably reduce the incidence of breast cancer (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68–0.92; I 2 54%) and endometrial cancer (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64–0.96; I 2 0%) in postmenopausal OP females. In addition, oral BPs were also found to evidently reduce the incidence of upper gastrointestinal cancer in OP patients among the entire population (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54–0.98; I 2 36.1%). However, oral BPs may lead to increased risk of liver cancer in mixed genders (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.03–2.77; I 2 30.7%). Conclusions: Taken together, oral BPs do not increase the risk of incidence of all-cause cancer; instead, they can reduce the incidence of breast, endometrial, and upper gastrointestinal cancers among the postmenopausal OP females. Our analysis stratified by gender suggests that oral BPs may increase the incidence of liver cancer in mixed genders, while no significant association was observed in females. Careful analysis of post-marketing data should be conducted to address the clinical relevance of our results on the putative association of oral BP use and liver cancer suggested by our meta-analysis. © 2017, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation." ;

However, it remains unclear how cancer cells migrate in the three-dimensional (3D) matrix of cancer tissues and how CAFs support the cancer invasion. Here we propose a novel mechanism of fibroblast-dependent cancer cell invasion in the 3D collagen matrix. Human cancer cell lines from the pancreas (Panc-1), lung (A549) and some other organs actively adhered to normal fibroblasts and primary lung CAFs in cultures. To show its significance in tumor invasion, we designed a new invasion assay in which homogeneous microspheroids consisting of cancer cells and fibroblasts were embedded into collagen gel. Time-lapse experiments showed that cancer cells adhered to and quickly migrated on the long protrusions of fibroblasts in the 3D collagen matrix. Fibroblast-free cancer cells poorly invaded the matrix. Experiments with function-blocking antibodies, siRNAs, and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that cancer cells adhered to fibroblasts through integrin α5β1-mediated binding to fibronectin on the surface of fibroblasts. Immunochemical analyses of the co-cultures and lung cancers suggested that cancer cells could acquire the migratory force by the fibronectin/integrin signaling. Our results also revealed that the fibroblast-bound fibronectin was a preferential substrate for cancer cells to migrate in the collagen matrix. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

However, very few studies investigated the role of integrin α3 (ITGα3) in malignant cancers. Here, we determined the functional role of ITGα3 in pancreatic cancer. Analysis of public microarray databases and Western blot analysis indicated a unique expression of ITGα3 in human pancreatic cancer. Silencing ITGα3 expression significantly inhibited the viability and migration of human pancreatic cancer cells. Notably, ablation of ITGα3 expression resulted in a significant decrease of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression compared with transfection of control-siRNA through an increased number of leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domain protein 1 (LRIG1) expression. In addition, ablating ITGα3 inhibited tumour growth via blockade of EGFR signalling in vivo. Furthermore, the highly expressed ITGα3 led to a poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. Our results provide novel insights into ITGα3-induced aggressive pancreatic cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Since epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in promoting metastasis of cancer, many mechanisms regarding EMT have been studied. We previously showed that Ribonucleic acid export 1 (RAE1) is dysregulated in breast cancer and its overexpression leads to aggressive breast cancer phenotypes by inducing EMT. Here, we evaluated the functional capacity of RAE1 in breast cancer metastasis by using a three-dimensional (3D) culture system and xenograft models. Furthermore, to investigate the mechanisms of RAE1-driven EMT, in vitro studies were carried out. The induction of EMT with RAE1-overexpression was confirmed under the 3D culture system and in vivo system. Importantly, RAE1 mediates upregulation of an EMT marker ZEB1, by binding to the promoter region of ZEB1. Knockdown of ZEB1 in RAE1-overexpressing cells suppressed invasive and migratory behaviors, accompanied by an increase in epithelial and a decrease in mesenchymal markers. Taken together, these data demonstrate that RAE1 contributes to breast cancer metastasis by regulating a key EMT-inducing factor ZEB1 expression, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Obesity is a risk factor for many cancers including breast, esophageal, colon, and thyroid cancer. We aimed to evaluate the association of thyroid cancer with body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and weight change. This nationwide population-based cohort study included 11,323,006 adults who joined the national health screening program. Weight change was defined as the difference between the weight of the subjects measured during the study period and the weight at the time of four years ago. For evaluating the association between the weight change and the risk of thyroid cancer, subjects without weight change for four years were defined as the reference group. Mean age was 50.1 ± 13.7 years and 44% were female. In total, 50,464 subjects (0.4%) had newly-diagnosed thyroid cancer. After multivariable analyses, the incidence of thyroid cancer increased significantly in subjects with larger WC as well as higher BMI (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). In subjects who were lean and became obese, the incidence of thyroid cancers increased significantly (hazard ratio [HR] 1.15 [1.11–1.19]). In subjects who were obese and became lean, the incidence of thyroid cancers decreased significantly (HR 0.89 [0.86–0.93]). These results demonstrated that higher BMI and larger WC were significantly associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer. Weight gain in lean subjects was associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer, and weight reduction in subjects with obesity was associated with a decreased risk of thyroid cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

In order to understand this increase, country specific dietary exposures have been investigated. The aim of this study was to quantify the association between consumption of brown cheese, a common bread topping in Norway, and colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer in the prospective Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) Study. Data on brown cheese consumption and adjustment factors was available for 82 527 women. During a mean of 14.6 years of follow-up (1.2 million person-years), there were 1360 cases of colorectal cancer (907 colon; 453 rectal). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer sites. We modelled restricted cubic splines with 4 knots, to assess a possible non-linear relationship between brown cheese intake and the investigated cancer sites. In the age-adjusted model, consumption of more than 2 slices (>16 grams) of brown cheese per day was associated with 13% reduced risk of colon cancer (95% CI 4%-21%) compared to women who did not consume brown cheese. The multivariable-adjusted model, however, showed no association between brown cheese consumption and the risk of colorectal, colon, or rectal cancer (colorectal: HR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.76–1.13, p-trend 0.37; colon: HR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.65–1.06; p-trend = 0.10; rectal: HR = 1.16, 95% CI 0.84–1.1.61, p-trend = 0.41). In this large, prospective cohort study of women, consumption of brown cheese was suggestively protective against colon cancer. However, adjustment attenuated the inverse risk association. Brown cheese consumption was not associated with rectal cancer, or colorectal cancer overall. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Current cancer diagnosis utilizes histopathology, which requires tissue acquisition, extensive processing and, in most cases, relies on the qualitative morphological analysis of tissues and cells. Molecular biomarkers are only available for a few specific tumor subtypes. We discovered that the fluorescence polarization (Fpol) of Methylene Blue (MB) is significantly higher in cancer than in normal human breast tissues and cells. We confirmed that fluorescence polarization imaging did not affect the viability of the cells and yielded highly significant differences between cancer and normal cells using MB concentrations as low as 0.05 and 0.01 mg/ml. To explain this phenomenon we examined intracellular localization of MB and its fluorescence lifetime. We determined that higher fluorescence polarization of MB occurs due to its increased accumulation in mitochondria of cancer cells, as well as shorter fluorescence lifetime in cancer relative to normal cells. As quantitative MB Fpol imaging can be performed in vivo and in real time, it holds the potential to provide an accurate quantitative marker of cancer at the cellular level. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

The anticancer polymers are designed to target anionic lipids exposed on the cancer cell surfaces and act by disrupting the cancer cell membranes. Because the polymer mechanism is not dependent on cell proliferation, we hypothesized that the polymers were active against dormant cancer cells. The polymers exhibited cytotoxicity to proliferating prostate cancer. Importantly, the polymer killed dormant prostate cancer cells that were resistant to docetaxel. This study demonstrates a new approach to discover novel anticancer therapeutics. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

We developed a novel computational platform applying a multi-modal approach to filter out passengers and more robustly identify putative driver genes. The primary filter identifies enrichment of cancer mutations in CATH functional families (CATH-FunFams) – structurally and functionally coherent sets of evolutionary related domains. Using structural representatives from CATH-FunFams, we subsequently seek enrichment of mutations in 3D and show that these mutation clusters have a very significant tendency to lie close to known functional sites or conserved sites predicted using CATH-FunFams. Our third filter identifies enrichment of putative driver genes in functionally coherent protein network modules confirmed by literature analysis to be cancer associated. Our approach is complementary to other domain enrichment approaches exploiting Pfam families, but benefits from more functionally coherent groupings of domains. Using a set of mutations from 22 cancers we detect 151 putative cancer drivers, of which 79 are not listed in cancer resources and include recently validated cancer associated genes EPHA7, DCC netrin-1 receptor and zinc-finger protein ZNF479. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Cox proportional hazards models were used. Males and females classified as obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg /m −2 ) have a 33% and 22% increased risk of all-cancer, respectively, than their normal weight counterparts. Similar all-cancer risk increases are observed for those above sex-specific WC guidelines.

Collectively, 86.3% (63/73) of HAMPs have recurrent alterations in at least 1 cancer type and 16 HAMPs, including 9 understudied HAMPs, are identified as putative therapeutic targets across multiple cancer types. For example, the recurrent focal amplification of BRD9 is observed in 9 cancer types and genetic depletion of BRD9 inhibits tumor growth.

        fabio:abstract    "The current system for evaluating prostate cancer architecture is the Gleason grading system which divides the morphology of cancer into five distinct architectural patterns, labeled 1 to 5 in increasing levels of cancer aggressiveness, and generates a score by summing the labels of the two most dominant patterns. The Gleason score is currently the most powerful prognostic predictor of patient outcomes; however, it suffers from problems in reproducibility and consistency due to the high intra-observer and inter-observer variability amongst pathologists. In addition, the Gleason system lacks the granularity to address potentially prognostic architectural features beyond Gleason patterns. We evaluate prostate cancer for architectural subtypes using techniques from topological data analysis applied to prostate cancer glandular architecture. In this work we demonstrate the use of persistent homology to capture architectural features independently of Gleason patterns. Specifically, using persistent homology, we compute topological representations of purely graded prostate cancer histopathology images of Gleason patterns 3,4 and 5, and show that persistent homology is capable of clustering prostate cancer histology into architectural groups through a ranked persistence vector. Our results indicate the ability of persistent homology to cluster prostate cancer histopathology images into unique groups with dominant architectural patterns consistent with the continuum of Gleason patterns. In addition, of particular interest, is the sensitivity of persistent homology to identify specific sub-architectural groups within single Gleason patterns, suggesting that persistent homology could represent a robust quantification method for prostate cancer architecture with higher granularity than the existing semi-quantitative measures. The capability of these topological representations to segregate prostate cancer by architecture makes them an ideal candidate for use as inputs to future machine learning approaches with the intent of augmenting traditional approaches with topological features for improved diagnosis and prognosis. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Accumulative studies demonstrate that UHRF1 is broadly overexpressed in cancers, which contributes to cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Interestingly, a proteasome-dependent downregulation of UHRF1 has been observed in pluripotent ground state mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) cultured in the presence of two kinase (MEK1/MEK2 and GSK3β) inhibitors (termed 2i), raising the question whether UHRF1 is similarly regulated in cancer cells. Here we present evidence that while addition of 2i broadly downregulates UHRF1 and DNMT1 in various cancer cells, distinct underlying mechanisms are involved. In contrast to mESCs, 2i-induced downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in cancer cells cannot be rescued by proteasome inhibitor and occurs primarily at the level of transcription. Furthermore, downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 by 2i is due to inhibition of MEK1/MEK2, but not GSK3β activity. Data mining reveals a marked co-expression of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in normal tissues as well as cancers. We provide evidence that multiple transcription factors including E2F1 and SP1 mediate the transcriptional activation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 by the activated MEK/ERK pathway. Together our study reveals distinct regulation of UHRF1/DNMT1 in mESCs and cancer cells and identifies activated MEK/ERK pathway as a driving force for coordinated and aberrant over-expression of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in cancers. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

When it is applied to cancer cells, solid stress hinders their proliferation rate and promotes cancer cell invasion and metastatic potential.

Here, we used two pancreatic cancer cell lines and an established in vitro system to study the effect of solid stress-induced signal transduction on pancreatic cancer cell migration as well as the mechanism involved. Our results show that the migratory ability of cells increases as a direct response to solid stress. We also found that Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) expression and secretion is strongly upregulated in pancreatic cancer cells in response to mechanical compression. Performing a phosphoprotein screening, we identified that solid stress activates the Akt/CREB1 pathway to transcriptionally regulate GDF15 expression, which eventually promotes pancreatic cancer cell migration. Our results suggest a novel solid stress signal transduction mechanism bringing GDF15 to the centre of pancreatic tumor biology and rendering it a potential target for future anti-metastatic therapeutic innovations. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a cancer treatment that make use of the cancer-specific accumulation of porphyrins. We have reported that mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mitROS) upregulate uptake transporter of porphyrins, heme carrier protein-1 (HCP-1). The accumulation of cancer-specific porphyrins was increased by mitROS production, thereby the cancer-specific PDT cytotoxicity was enhanced. Thus we investigated whether mitROS production by hyperthermia can enhanced the cytotoxicity of PDT or not. In this study, 1 h of hyperthermia at 42 °C increased the mitROS production, and both the accumulation of cancer-specific porphyrins and the PDT cytotoxicity increased. Moreover, the authors treated cells with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) to examine the effect of mitROS. NAC inhibited the increasing ROS production after hyperthermia to restrain the post-treatment increase of cancer-specific porphyrins accumulation. Moreover, the increase of ROS production in cancer cells after hyperthermia upregulated HCP-1 expression and downregulated ABCG2 expression. These regulation were inhibited by NAC. These results suggest that hyperthermia treatment increased mitROS production, which involved HpD accumulation and enhanced PDT effects in cancer cells. The mechanism of this phenomenon was most likely to be due to both the upregulation of HCP-1 and the downregulation of ABCG2 by mitROS. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Recent studies showed that changes to the gut microbiome alters the microbiome-derived metabolome, potentially promoting carcinogenesis in organs that are distal to the gut. In this study, we assessed the relationship between breast cancer and cadaverine biosynthesis. Cadaverine treatment of Balb/c female mice (500 nmol/kg p.o. q.d.) grafted with 4T1 breast cancer cells ameliorated the disease (lower mass and infiltration of the primary tumor, fewer metastases, and lower grade tumors). Cadaverine treatment of breast cancer cell lines corresponding to its serum reference range (100–800 nM) reverted endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, inhibited cellular movement and invasion, moreover, rendered cells less stem cell-like through reducing mitochondrial oxidation. Trace amino acid receptors (TAARs), namely, TAAR1, TAAR8 and TAAR9 were instrumental in provoking the cadaverine-evoked effects. Early stage breast cancer patients, versus control women, had reduced abundance of the CadA and LdcC genes in fecal DNA, both responsible for bacterial cadaverine production. Moreover, we found low protein expression of E. coli LdcC in the feces of stage 1 breast cancer patients. In addition, higher expression of lysine decarboxylase resulted in a prolonged survival among early-stage breast cancer patients. Taken together, cadaverine production seems to be a regulator of early breast cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

The specific function of CBX6 in breast cancer is currently undefined. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset led to the identification of CBX6 as a consistently downregulated gene in breast cancer. We provided evidence showing enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) negatively regulated CBX6 expression in a Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)-dependent manner. Exogenous overexpression of CBX6 inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation, and induced cell cycle arrest along with suppression of migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro. Microarray analyses revealed that CBX6 governs a complex gene expression program. Moreover, CBX6 induced significant downregulation of bone marrow stromal cell antigen-2 (BST2), a potential therapeutic target, via interactions with its promoter region. Our collective findings support a tumor suppressor role of CBX6 in breast cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "MRI plays important roles in endometrial and cervical cancer assessment, from detection to recurrent disease evaluation. Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common malignant tumor of the female genital tract in Western countries. EC patients are divided into risk categories based on histopathological tumor type, grade, and myometrial invasion depth. EC is surgically staged using the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) system. Since FIGO (2009) stage correlates with prognosis, preoperative staging is essential for tailored treatment. MRI reveals myometrial invasion depth, which correlates with tumor grade and lymph node metastases, and thus correlates with prognosis. Cervical cancer (CC) is the second most common cancer, and the third leading cause of cancer-related death among females in developing countries. The FIGO Gynecologic Oncology Committee recently revised its CC staging guidelines, allowing staging based on imaging and pathological findings when available. The revised FIGO (2017) staging includes node involvement and thus enables both therapy selection and evaluation, prognosis estimation, and calculation of end results. MRI can accurately assess prognostic indicators, e.g., tumor size, parametrial invasion, pelvic sidewall, and lymph node invasion. Despite these important roles of MRI, radiologists still face challenges due to the technical and interpretation pitfalls of MRI during all phases of endometrial and cervical cancer evaluation. Awareness of mimics that can simulate both cancers is critical. With careful application, functional MRI with DWI and DCE sequences can help establish a correct diagnosis, although it is sometimes necessary to perform biopsy and histopathological analysis. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

This led to the first biological based liquid biopsy test, which we called MATER-D platform. In the present study, we showed for the first time that a different type of OMCs (PTEN-deficient human epithelial MCF10A cells) turn malignant when exposed to cancer patient’s sera, confirming the concept that different cells with diverse oncosuppressor mutations can uptake cancer factors and be used in biological based liquid biopsy tests. Our observations were confirmed in a large variety of solid and haematological malignancies. This test was able to detect dysplasia and carcinomas in situ lesions in different organs and circulating factors in cancer patients years after the removal of their lesions. To our knowledge, this ability is unique and not shared by other liquid biopsy platforms. Immunohistochemistry analysis of the xenotransplants revealed identical patterns of differentiation regardless of the cancer type, showing that differentiation through horizontal transfer might be dependent on the nature of the target cells rather than the type of cancer factors. These data strengthen the notion that OMC-based liquid biopsy tests might be promising platforms for cancer screening. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Various studies have shown the significance of identifying drug targets for cancer, although this process continues challenging in the field of anti-cancer drug designing. The primary purpose of this study is to design a novel approach to identify target genes for cancer. The sub-network of colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancers were constructed from human protein–protein interaction network. The potential genes were analyzed using hubs and centrality measures. For the identification of target genes, we retrieve those genes that had the highest score in both mutation rates and graph centrality. Moreover, gene deletion analysis revealed that MYC, TP53, and EGFR genes remained potential targets in colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancer respectively. Results suggest that combining network measures with mutation frequencies in cancer genes might assist in recognizing several potential drug targets. Future enhancement of this current approach is to combine these network properties with the biological insights from gene expression data, and their functions will provide a reliable method for rational drug designing. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature." ;

Owing to enhanced permeability and retention in solid tumor tissue, nanoparticle (NP) delivery systems have been emerged as novel strategy in cancer chemotherapy. As extracellular matrix, glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) could bind its surface receptor adhesion molecule CD44 which is strongly expressed on breast cancer. We have previously reported a doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded HA-Lys-LA X-NPs (X-NP-DOX) NP delivery system for breast cancer treatment. In this study, we further investigated the antitumor effect of X-NP-DOX NP delivery system using low-dose DOX in both in vitro and in vivo systems. We demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX possessed the ability for inhibiting MCF-7 breast cancer cell growth, invasion, and migration, and inducing apoptosis in vitro. In in vivo experiments, injection of low-dose X-NP-DOX into tumor-bearing mouse resulted in significant reduction of tumor size. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining further revealed that low-dose X-NP-DOX induced higher percentage of apoptotic cells compared with free DOX or saline. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX inhibited Notch1 and Ras/MAPK pathways, decreased cancer stem cell population, and reduced tumorigenesis compared to free DOX in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Owing to its enhanced efficacy and higher targetability compared to free DOX, low-dose DOX delivered by NP system may be a promising novel strategy for breast cancer treatment." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Breast cancer survivors display altered inflammatory responses to immune challenges relative to cancer-naive controls likely due to previous cancer treatments, stress associated with cancer, and/or tumor physiology. Proper inflammatory responses are necessary for adaptive sickness behaviors (e.g., fatigue, anorexia, and fever) and neuroinflammatory pathways are also implicated in mental health disturbances (e.g., cognitive impairment, depression) suffered by cancer patients and survivors. Rodent cancer models indicate that tumors are sufficient to exacerbate neuroinflammatory responses after an immune challenge, however primary tumors are not usually present in cancer survivors, and the behavioral consequences of these brain changes remain understudied. Therefore, we tested the extent to which mammary tumor resection attenuates tumor-induced neuroinflammation and sickness behavior following an immune challenge (i.p. lipopolysaccharide [LPS] injection) in mice. Tnf-α, Il-1β, and Il-6 mRNA decreased in multiple brain regions of LPS-treated tumor-bearing mice relative to LPS-treated controls; tumor resection attenuated these effects in some cases (but not Tnf-α). Tumors also attenuated sickness behaviors (hypothermia and lethargy) compared to LPS-treated controls. Tumor resection reversed these behavioral consequences, although basal body temperature remained elevated, comparable to tumor-bearing mice. Thus, tumors significantly modulate neuroinflammatory pathways with functional consequences and tumor resection mitigates most, but not all, of these changes. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Natural compounds are a realistic source of new bioactive compounds with anticancer activity. Among them, rosemary polyphenols have shown a vast antiproliferative capacity against colon cancer cells in vitro and in animal models. We have investigated the antitumor activity of a rosemary extract (RE) obtained by using supercritical fluid extraction through its capacity to inhibit various signatures of cancer progression and metastasis such as proliferation, migration, invasion and clonogenic survival. RE strongly inhibited proliferation, migration and colony formation of colon cancer cells regardless their phenotype. Treatment with RE led to a sharp increase of intracellular ROS that resulted in necrosis cell death. Nrf2 gene silencing increased RE cytotoxic effects, thus suggesting that this pathway was involved in cell survival. These in vitro results were in line with a reduction of tumor growth by oral administration of RE in a xenograft model of colon cancer cells using athymic nude mice. These findings indicate that targeting colon cancer cells by increasing intracellular ROS and decreasing cell survival mechanisms may suppose a therapeutic option in colon cancer through the combination of rosemary compounds and chemotherapeutic drugs. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Although cure rates are high for early stage disease, clinical outcomes for advanced, metastatic, or recurrent disease remain poor. To change this panorama, a deeper understanding of cervical cancer biology and novel study models are needed. Immortalized human cancer cell lines such as HeLa constitute crucial scientific tools, but there are few other cervical cancer cell lines available, limiting our understanding of a disease known for its molecular heterogeneity. This study aimed to establish novel cervical cancer cell lines derived from Brazilian patients. We successfully established one (HCB-514) out of 35 cervical tumors biopsied. We confirmed the phenotype of HCB-514 by verifying its’ epithelial and tumor origin through cytokeratins, EpCAM and p16 staining. It was also HPV-16 positive. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) showed relevant somatic mutations in several genes including BRCA2, TGFBR1 and IRX2. A copy number variation (CNV) analysis by nanostring and WES revealed amplification of genes mainly related to kinases proteins involved in proliferation, migration and cell differentiation, such as EGFR, PIK3CA, and MAPK7. Overexpression of EGFR was confirmed by phospho RTK-array and validated by western blot analysis. Furthermore, the HCB-514 cell line was sensitive to cisplatin. In summary, this novel Brazilian cervical cancer cell line exhibits relevant key molecular features and constitutes a new biological model for pre-clinical studies. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Oncogene-induced replication stress (RS) promotes cancer development but also impedes tumor growth by activating anti-cancer barriers. To determine how cancer cells adapt to RS, we have monitored the expression of different components of the ATR-CHK1 pathway in primary tumor samples. We show that unlike upstream components of the pathway, the checkpoint mediators Claspin and Timeless are overexpressed in a coordinated manner. Remarkably, reducing the levels of Claspin and Timeless in HCT116 cells to pretumoral levels impeded fork progression without affecting checkpoint signaling. These data indicate that high level of Claspin and Timeless increase RS tolerance by protecting replication forks in cancer cells. Moreover, we report that primary fibroblasts adapt to oncogene-induced RS by spontaneously overexpressing Claspin and Timeless, independently of ATR signaling. Altogether, these data indicate that enhanced levels of Claspin and Timeless represent a gain of function that protects cancer cells from of oncogene-induced RS in a checkpoint-independent manner. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Turmeric, since in ancient Indian traditional medicinal system, has been implicated for its therapeutic and chemopreventive properties against a broad spectrum of diseases. Curcumin, the active polyphenol from turmeric, helps to obstruct the growth of many types of cancers at various stages which include prostrate, melanoma, breast, brain tumor, pancreatic, leukemia, etc. The initiation and recurrence of cancer have been attributed to few mutated cells in bulk of tumor called as cancer stem cells which have the capacity of self-renewal and differentiation. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3B) is a multifunctional serine/threonine protein kinase, originally found in mammals, an important component of diverse signaling pathways, dysregulation of which leads to affect the cancer stem cell properties. The nutritional- and phytochemical-based dietary interventions may complement current chemotherapy to prevent recurrence and relapse of cancer. The objective of present study is to investigate the effect of retinoic acid and curcumin–retinoic acid conjugates against GSK-3B protein. The in silico results indicate that molecule 3 (curcumin–retinoic acid conjugates) might be a potent inhibitor of GSK-3B and a novel future drug candidate for the treatment of cancer. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature." ;

        fabio:abstract    "In this study, we aimed to identify mutations of key genes associated with docetaxel resistance in nine endometrial cancer cell lines. Endometrial cancers are associated with several critical gene mutations, including PIK3A, PTEN, and KRAS. Different gene mutations in endometrial cancer cells have varied responses to anticancer drugs and cancer therapies. The most frequently altered gene in endometrioid endometrial carcinoma tumors is PTEN. PTEN protein has lipid phosphatase and protein phosphatase activity, as well as other functions in the nucleus. Although the tumor-suppressive function of PTEN has mainly been attributed to its lipid phosphatase activity, a role for PTEN protein phosphatase activity in cell cycle regulation has also been suggested. Various tumor type-specific PTEN mutations are well documented. Here, nine endometrioid endometrial cancer cell lines with PIK3A, PTEN, and KRAS gene mutations were treated with docetaxel and radiation. One mutation with a docetaxel drug-resistant effect was a truncated form of PTEN. Among PTEN mutations in endometrial cancer cells, the Y68 frame shift mutation of PTEN constitutes a major mechanism of resistance to docetaxel treatment. The molecular mechanism involves truncation of the 403 amino acid PTEN protein at amino acid 68 by the Y68 frame shift, leading to the loss of PTEN protein phosphatase and lipid phosphatase activities. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Hence to mimic such complex biological processes, an understanding of stimuli responsiveness is needed to sense specific changes and respond in a predictable manner. Such responses due to polymers may take place either simultaneously at the site or in a sequential manner from preparation to transporting pathways to cellular compartments. The present review comprehends the stimuli-responsive polymers and multi-responsiveness with respect to cancer therapy. It focuses on the exploitation of different stimuli like temperature, pH and enzymes responsiveness in a multi-stimuli setting. Nanogels and micelles being two of the most commonly used responsive polymeric carriers have also been discussed. The role of multiple stimuli delivery system is significant due to multiple changes happening in the near surroundings of cancer cells. These responsive materials are able to mimic some biological processes and recognize at the molecular level itself to manipulate development of custom-designed molecules for targeting cancer cells." ;

In contrast, antibodies to BLV were found in a very small percentage of healthy blood donors. There was no association between BLV DNA and other tumor prognostic biological markers such as hormonal receptors, HER2 oncoprotein, proliferation index, metastasis in sentinels lymph nodes, and tumor grade and size. Our findings suggest that BLV should be considered a potential predisposing factor to breast cancer in women. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Here we report that ovarian cancer cells manifest a spectrum of tumorigenic phenotypes upon knockdown of PIK3R1. PIK3R1 loss activates AKT and p110-independent JAK2/STAT3 signaling through inducing changes in the phosphorylation of the docking protein Gab2, thereby relieving the negative inhibition on AKT and promoting the assembly of JAK2/STAT3 signalosome, respectively. Additional mechanisms leading to AKT activation include enhanced p110α kinase activity and a decrease in PTEN level. PIK3R1 loss renders ovarian cancer cells vulnerable to inhibition of AKT or JAK2/STAT3. The combination of AKT and STAT3 inhibitors significantly increases the anti-tumor effect compared to single-agent treatments.

Finally, analysis of 214 prostate and 35 breast cancer genomes reveal that late-replicating regions are prone to cis and early-replication to trans chromosomal rearrangements.

        fabio:abstract    "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are promising therapies for haematological cancers. Historically, their therapeutic benefit is due to ADC targeting of lineage-restricted antigens. The C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is attractive for targeted therapy of haematological cancers, given its expression in multiple tumour types and role in cancer “homing” to bone marrow. However, CXCR4 is also expressed in haematopoietic cells and other normal tissues, raising safety challenges to the development of anti-CXCR4 ADCs for cancer treatment. Here, we designed the first anti-CXCR4 ADC with favourable therapeutic index, effective in xenografts of haematopoietic cancers resistant to standard of care and anti-CXCR4 antibodies. We screened multiple ADC configurations, by varying type of linker-payload, drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR), affinity and Fc format. The optimal ADC bears a non-cleavable linker, auristatin as payload at DAR = 4 and a low affinity antibody with effector–reduced Fc. Contrary to other drugs targeting CXCR4, anti-CXCR4 ADCs effectively eliminated cancer cells as monotherapy, while minimizing leucocytosis. The optimal ADC selectively eliminated CXCR4 + cancer cells in solid tumours, but showed limited toxicity to normal CXCR4 + tissues, sparing haematopoietic stem cells and progenitors. Our work provides proof-of-concept that through empirical ADC design, it is possible to target proteins with broad normal tissue expression. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Cancers in the bone produce a number of severe symptoms including pain that compromises patient functional status, quality of life, and survival. The source of this pain is multifaceted and includes factors secreted from tumor cells. Malignant cells release the neurotransmitter and cell-signaling molecule glutamate via the oxidative stress-related cystine/glutamate antiporter, system x C − , which reciprocally imports cystine for synthesis of glutathione and the cystine/cysteine redox cycle. Pharmacological inhibition of system x C − has shown success in reducing and delaying the onset of cancer pain-related behavior in mouse models. This investigation describes the development of a stable siRNA-induced knockdown of the functional trans-membrane system x C − subunit xCT (SLC7A11) in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Clones were verified for xCT knockdown at the transcript, protein, and functional levels. RNAseq was performed on a representative clone to comprehensively examine the transcriptional cellular signature in response to xCT knockdown, identifying multiple differentially regulated factors relevant to cancer pain including nerve growth factor, interleukin-1, and colony-stimulating factor-1. Mice were inoculated intrafemorally and recordings of pain-related behaviors including weight bearing, mechanical withdrawal, and limb use were performed. Animals implanted with xCT knockdown cancer cells displayed a delay until the onset of nociceptive behaviors relative to control cells. These results add to the body of evidence suggesting that a reduction in glutamate release from cancers in bone by inhibition of the system x C − transporter may decrease the severe and intractable pain associated with bone metastases. © The Author(s) 2017." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Background: The global cancer incidence and the number of survivors are increasing. Therefore, it is necessary to pay more attention to the side effects of treatment. Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of reflexology on the side effects of chemotherapy in cancer patients. Method: For finding the related articles, the researchers searched several databases including PubMed &ProQuest and valid websites including ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Scientific Information Database, and Magiran. The key terms of \"reflexology, cancer, and chemotherapy\" individually and combined together were searched in Parisian and English, and the studies performed from 2009 to 2017 were extracted. Due to the lack of sufficient studies carried out into the outcome of reflexology on chemotherapy, both Persian and English articles were used. Results: A total of 57 studies were extracted from the databases and valid websites; five of which met the inclusion criteria. All selected studies were clinical trials. Implications for Practice: Reflexology can be used as a non-pharmacologic nursing intervention to alleviate the side effects of chemotherapy and improve the quality of life of cancer patients. © 2017 Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

        fabio:abstract    "CD47 is a prominent new target in cancer immunotherapy, with antagonistic antibodies currently being evaluated in clinical trials. For effective evaluation of this strategy it is crucial to identify which patients are suited for CD47-targeted therapy. In this respect, expression of the pro-phagocytic signal SLAMF7 on both macrophages and cancer cells was recently reported to be a requisite for CD47 antibody-mediated phagocytosis. Here, we demonstrate that in fact SLAMF7 expression on cancer cells is not required and does not impact on CD47 antibody therapy. Moreover, SLAMF7 also does not impact on phagocytosis induction by CD20 antibody rituximab nor associates with overall survival of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma patients. In contrast, expression of CD47 negatively impacts on overall and progression free survival. In conclusion, cancer cell expression of SLAMF7 is not required for phagocytosis and, in contrast to CD47 expression, should not be used as selection criterion for CD47-targeted therapy. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Increased Crabp2 levels have been found in various types of cancer, and are associated with poor patients’ survival. Although Crabp2 is found to be overexpressed in lung cancer, its role in metastasis of lung cancer is unclear. In this study, Crabp2 was overexpressed in high-metastatic C10F4 than low-metastatic lung cancer cells. Analysis of clinical samples revealed that high CRABP2 levels were correlated with lymph node metastases, poor overall survival, and increased recurrence. Knockdown of Crabp2 decreased migration, invasion, anoikis resistance, and in vivo metastasis. Crabp2 was co-immunoprecipitated with HuR, and overexpression of Crabp2 increased HuR levels, which promoted integrin β1/FAK/ERK signaling. Inhibition of HuR or integrin β1/FAK/ERK signaling reversed the promoting effect of Crabp2 in migration, invasion, and anoikis resistance. Knockdown of Crabp2 further inhibited the growth of cancer cells as compared with that by gemcitabine or irinotecan alone. The expression of Crabp2 in human lung tumors was correlated with stress marker CHOP. In conclusion, our findings have identified the promoting role of Crabp2 in anoikis resistance and metastasis. CRABP2 may serve as a prognostic marker and targeting CRABP2 may be exploited as a modality to reduce metastasis. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "SPG-56 is a newly isolated glycoprotein from sweet potatoes (Zhongshu NO. 1), but its value for suppressing breast cancer progression remains unknown. This study was designed to investigate the potential anti-cancer effects of SPG-56, which consists of 2.9% sugar and 97.1% protein. The effects of SPG-56 on the proliferation and apoptosis of breast cancer cells were determined using CCK-8 and Hoechst 33342 assays and flow cytometry, after staining with Annexin V and PI respectively. The activities of SPG-56 against breast cancer were examined using female BALB/c nude mice orthotopically implanted with human breast carcinoma cells of the types MCF-7 and 4T1-Luc. The cellular experiments showed that SPG-56 inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of MCF-7 cells dose- and time-dependently. Oral administration of SPG-56 significantly suppressed the development of MCF-7 tumor cells (P < 0.01) as compared with an untreated group. The serum tumor markers CEA, CA125 and CA153 in a 240 mg/kg/d SPG-56 decreased by 54.8%, 91.8%, and 90.3%, respectively. The experiments further demonstrated that SPG-56 inhibited the metastasis of breast cancer in MCF-7 and 4T1-bearing mice by altering the expression of MMP2, MMP9, VEGF, Occludin and Claudin. It is concluded that SPG-56 may have potential as a novel anti-tumor candidate for breast cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Lymph node metastasis is of major prognostic significance for breast cancer. Lymph node metastasis arises at a very early stage in some patients. Using the data downloaded from the TCGA database, we studied the differences between primary tumors with and without lymph node metastasis at the multi-omics level using bioinformatics approaches. Our study found that low mutation and neoantigen burdens correlated with lymph node metastazation of breast cancer. All three conserved domains in TP53 were mutated in lymph node-negative breast cancers, whereas only one domain was mutated in lymph node-positive samples. Mutations in microtubule-related proteins appear to help immune cells recognize tumors and inhibit their lymph node metastasis. Destroying microtubule-related proteins is a potential therapeutic strategy to inhibit lymph node metastasis of breast cancer. As the neoantigens specifically present in lymph node-positive breast cancers, MAPK10, BC9L, TRIM65, CD93, KITLG, CNPPD1, CPED1, CCDC146, TMEM185A, INO80D, and PSMD11 are potential targets for vaccine design. In the tumor microenvironment, reduced numbers of effector immune cells, especially activated memory CD4+ T cells and activated mast cells, facilitate breast cancer metastasis to the lymph nodes. According to transcriptome data, lymph node metastasis was mostly driven by gene mutation rather than by gene expression. Although differential gene expression analysis was based on lymph node metastasis status, many genes were shown to be differentially expressed based on estrogen receptor status. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Fibroblasts turn into cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumour microenvironment. CAFs have recently attracted attention for their function as a regulator of immune cell recruitment and function in addition to their tumour-promoting roles. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of CAFs on monocyte recruitment and macrophage polarization in breast cancer. CAFs, which were α-SMA expressing fibroblasts in contrast to normal fibroblasts (NFs), effectively recruited monocytes. Recruitment of monocytes by CAFs might be mediated by monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) as well as stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) cytokines. CAFs differentiated the recruited monocytes into M2-like macrophages which are capable of exerting their immunosuppressive roles via the PD-1 axis. CAF-educated monocytes exhibited strong immune suppression unlike NF-educated monocytes and enhanced the motility/invasion of breast cancer cells in addition to increasing the expressions of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes and vimentin protein in cancer cells. CAF-educated M1 macrophages displayed increased expression of M2 markers and production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in contrast to decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12 compared with control M1 macrophages; suggesting that CAFs were also able to induce the trans-differentiation of M1 macrophages to M2 macrophages. We then investigated the relationship between the infiltration of CAFs and tumour associated macrophages (TAMs) using tissue samples obtained from breast cancer patients. High grade of CAFs significantly correlated with the number of TAMs in human breast cancer tissue samples. It was also associated with higher Ki-67 proliferation index, and higher tumour volume. This result is in line with our finding of increased breast cancer cell proliferation due to the effects of CAF-educated monocytes in vitro. Our results concluded that CAFs play pivotal roles in sculpturing the tumour microenvironment in breast cancer, and therapeutic strategies to reverse the CAF-mediated immunosuppressive microenvironment should be taken into consideration. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

We construct iCells of four cancers and the corresponding tissue controls and identify the most rewired genes in cancer.

We biologically validate that they have a role in cancer by knockdown experiments followed by cell viability assays.

We benchmarked Uniquorn 2 by cross-identifying 1612 RNA and 3596 panel-sized NGS profiles derived from 1516 CCLs, five repositories, four technologies and three major cancer panel-designs. Our method achieves an accuracy of 96% for RNA-seq and 95% for mixed DNA-seq and RNA-seq identification. Even for a panel of only 94 cancer-related genes, accuracy remains at 82% but decreases when using smaller panels.

The angular spectra of scattering coefficient maps of normal tissues exhibit a spatial feature distinct from those of abnormal tissues. An angular spectrum index to quantify the differences between the normal and abnormal tissues is derived, and its strength in revealing subsurface cancer in ex vivo samples is statistically analyzed.

        fabio:abstract    "Metastatic colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer death. Current options in palliation such as hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) present severe side effects. Recent research efforts suggested the therapeutic use of oxidant-enriched liquid using cold physical plasma. To investigate a clinically accepted treatment regimen, we assessed the antitumor capacity of plasma-treated saline solution. In response to such liquid, CT26 murine colon cancer cells were readily oxidized and showed cell growth with subsequent apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and upregulation of immunogenic cell death (ICD) markers in vitro. This was accompanied by marked morphological changes with re-arrangement of actin fibers and reduced motility. Induction of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype was not observed. Key results were confirmed in MC38 colon and PDA6606 pancreatic cancer cells. Compared to plasma-treated saline, hydrogen peroxide was inferiorly toxic in 3D tumor spheroids but of similar efficacy in 2D models. In vivo, plasma-treated saline decreased tumor burden in Balb/C mice. This was concomitant with elevated numbers of intratumoral macrophages and increased T cell activation following incubation with CT26 cells ex vivo. Being a potential adjuvant for HIPEC therapy, our results suggest oxidizing saline solutions to inactivate colon cancer cells while potentially stimulating antitumor immune responses. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Although solid fuel combustion emissions are known to increase the prevalence of illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer, however, their effect on the eyes is underexplored. This study assesses the acute toxicity of solid fuel combustion emissions on healthy ocular cells and a cancer cell line. Three healthy ocular cell lines (corneal, lens, and retinal epithelial cells) and a cancer cell line (Chinese hamster ovary cells) were exposed to liquid and gas phase emissions from applewood and coal combustion. Following the exposure, real-time cell attachment behavior was monitored for at least 120 hours with electrical cell impedance spectroscopy. The viability of the cells, amount of apoptotic cells, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were quantified with MTT, ApoTox-Glo, and ROS-Glo H 2 O 2 assays, respectively. The results showed that coal emissions compromised the viability of ocular cells more than applewood emissions. Interestingly, the cancer cells, although their viability was not compromised, generated 1.7 to 2.7 times more ROS than healthy cells. This acute exposure study provides compelling proof that biomass combustion emissions compromise the viability of ocular cells and increase ROS generation. The increased ROS generation was fatal for ocular cells, but it promoted the growth of cancer cells. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) include endogenous metabolites that provide information about health and disease which might be useful to develop a better screening method for breast cancer. The goal of this study was to classify mice with and without tumors and compare tumors localized to the mammary pad and tumor cells injected into the iliac artery by differences in VOCs in urine. After 4T1.2 tumor cells were injected into BALB/c mice either in the mammary pad or into the iliac artery, urine was collected, VOCs from urine headspace were concentrated by solid phase microextraction and results were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry quadrupole time-of-flight. Multivariate and univariate statistical analyses were employed to find potential biomarkers for breast cancer and metastatic breast cancer in mice models. A set of six VOCs classified mice with and without tumors with an area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC AUC) of 0.98 (95% confidence interval [0.85, 1.00]) via five-fold cross validation. Classification of mice with tumors in the mammary pad and iliac artery was executed utilizing a different set of six VOCs, with a ROC AUC of 0.96 (95% confidence interval [0.75, 1.00]). © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

In an additional two metastatic colon cancer patients, we detected CD8 + neoantigen-specific cells targeting the mutated SMAD5 and MUC4 proteins.

Moreover, the high drug loading capacity of Cet-SLN was employed to encapsulate photothermal agent indocyanine green (ICG) to finally fabricate a versatile drug delivery system (DDS) able to co-deliver Cet and ICG (Cet-SLN/ICG) for combinational chemo-photothermal therapy of breast cancer. The obtained results clearly demonstrated that Cet-SLN/ICG was well-dispersed nanoparticles with preferable stability under physiological condition. Furthermore, due to the conjugation of Cet, Cet-SLN/ICG could target EGFR which overexpress in MCF-7 cells. Most importantly, both in vitro and in vivo results suggested that compared with Cet or ICG alone, the Cet-SLN/ICG showed superior anticancer efficacy. In conclusion, Cet-SLN/ICG could be a potential platform for effective combinational chemo-photothermal therapy for breast cancer." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The integration of genomic and DNA methylation data has been demonstrated as a powerful strategy in understanding cancer mechanisms and identifying therapeutic targets. The TCGA consortium has mapped DNA methylation in thousands of cancer samples using Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 K BeadChip (Illumina 450 K array) that only covers about 1.5% of CpGs in the human genome. Therefore, increasing the coverage of the DNA methylome would significantly leverage the usage of the TCGA data. Here, we present a new model called EAGLING that can expand the Illumina 450 K array data 18 times to cover about 30% of the CpGs in the human genome. We applied it to analyze 13 cancers in TCGA. By integrating the expanded methylation, gene expression, and somatic mutation data, we identified the genes showing differential patterns in each of the 13 cancers. Many of the triple-evidenced genes identified in majority of the cancers are biomarkers or potential biomarkers. Pan-cancer analysis also revealed the pathways in which the triple-evidenced genes are enriched, which include well known ones as well as new ones, such as axonal guidance signaling pathway and pathways related to inflammatory processing or inflammation response. Triple-evidenced genes, particularly TNXB, RRM2, CELSR3, SLC16A3, FANCI, MMP9, MMP11, SIK1, and TRIM59 showed superior predictive power in both tumor diagnosis and prognosis. These results have demonstrated that the integrative analysis using the expanded methylation data is powerful in identifying critical genes/pathways that may serve as new therapeutic targets. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

However, macrophages make up a majority of immune cell infiltrates into tumors, creating natural targets for immunotherapies able to direct macrophages away from tumor-supportive functions and toward anti-tumor phenotypes. Recent studies demonstrate that toll-like receptors (TLRs) – pathways that quickly trigger early immune responses – play an important role in polarizing macrophages. Here, we present emerging ways in which TLR signaling is being manipulated in macrophages to create new opportunities for cancer immunotherapy. In particular, we discuss approaches to deliver TLR agonists, to leverage biomaterials in these therapies, and to couple TLR-based approaches with other frontline treatments as combination cancer therapies. © 2017" ;

We analyzed the immune profiles, T cell cytotoxicity, and TCR repertoire of peripheral blood, normal lung tissue, and tumor tissue from NSCLC patients. By using bispecific T-cell engager technology to assess the cytotoxicity of T cells, we found that the cytotoxicity of tumor-infiltrated T cells closely correlated with that of peripheral T cells. This correlation was supported by the immune profiles, cytokine production, and results of the TCR repertoire analysis from these specimens. We also found that the cytotoxicity of peripheral T cells has potential as a predictor of the effects of nivolumab in the tumor microenvironment.

This standard procedure relies on the slow radioactivity loss, usually attributed to the limited tumour expression of G6P-phosphatase (G6Pase). However, this classical interpretation intrinsically represents an approximation since, as in all tissues, cancer G6Pase activity is remarkable and is confined to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whose lumen must be reached by phosphorylated FDG to explain its hydrolysis and radioactivity release. The present study tested the impact of G6Pase sequestration on the mathematical description of FDG trafficking and handling in cultured cancer cells. Our data show that accounting for tracer access to the ER configures this compartment as the preferential site of FDG accumulation. This is confirmed by the reticular localization of fluorescent FDG analogues. Remarkably enough, reticular accumulation rate of FDG is dependent upon extracellular glucose availability, thus configuring the same ER as a significant determinant of cancer glucose metabolism. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Although current methods of treatment for cervical cancer can ablate lesions, preventing metastatic disseminations and excessive tissue injuries still remains a major concern. Hence, development of a safer and more efficient treatment modality is of vital importance. Natural products from plants are one of the principal sources of precursors to lead compounds with direct pharmaceutical application across all disease classes. One of these plants is Ficus carica, whose fruit latex, when applied on HPV-induced skin warts, has shown potential as a possible cure for this virus related lesions. This study explores the in vitro biological activities of fig latex and elucidates its possible mechanisms of action on cervical cancer cell lines CaSki and HeLa positive for HPV type 16 and 18, respectively. Our data shows that fig latex inhibits properties that are associated with HPV-positive cervical cancer transformed cells such as rapid growth and invasion and substantially downregulated the expression of p16 and HPV onco-proteins E6, E7. These findings suggest Ficus carica latex has the potential to be used in the development of therapeutic modalities for the possible treatment, cure and prevention of HPV related cervical cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing methods, the diversity and composition of the microbiota from ovarian cancer tissues (25 samples) and normal distal fallopian tube tissues (25 samples) were analyzed. High-throughput sequencing showed that the diversity and richness indexes were significantly decreased in ovarian cancer tissues compared to tissues from normal distal fallopian tubes. The ratio of the two phyla for Proteobacteria/Firmicutes was notably increased in ovarian cancer, which revealed that microbial composition change might be associated with the process of ovarian cancer development. In addition, transcriptome-sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses suggested that the transcriptional profiles were statistically different between ovarian carcinoma and normal distal fallopian tubes. Moreover, a set of genes including 84 different inflammation-associated or immune-associated genes, which had been named as the human antibacterial-response genes were also modulated expression.

        fabio:abstract    "Several pioneering work have established that apart from genetic alterations, epigenetic modifications contribute significantly in tumor progression. Remarkable role of EZH2 in cancer highlights the importance of identifying its targets. Although much emphasis has been placed in recent years in designing drugs and inhibitors targeting EZH2, less effort has been given in exploring its existing targets that will help in understanding the oncogenic role of EZH2 in turn which may provide a more stringent method of targeting EZH2. In the present study, we validated six direct targets of EZH2 that are GPNMB, PMEPA1, CoL5A1, VGLL4, POMT2 and SUMF1 associated with cancer related pathways. Upon EZH2 knockdown, more than two fold increase in the target gene expression was evident. CHIP-qPCR performed in both MCF-7 and MDA-MDA-231 confirmed the in-vivo binding of EZH2 on its identified target. Thirty invasive breast carcinoma cases with their adjacent normal tissues were included in the study. Immunohistochemistry in primary breast tumor tissue array showed tumor dependent expression of EZH2. Array of MERAV expression database revealed the strength of association of EZH2 with its target genes. Real time PCR performed with RNA extracted from breast tumor tissues further authenticated the existing negative correlation between EZH2 and its target genes. Pearson correlation coefficient & statistical significance computed using the matrix provided in the database strengthened the negative correlation between identified target genes and EZH2. KM plotter analysis showed improved relapse-free survival with increased expression of PMEPA1, POMT2, VGLL4 and SUMF1 in breast cancer patients indicating their therapeutic potential. While investigating the relevance of these target genes, different mutations of them were found in breast cancer patients. Seeking the clinical relevance of our study, following our recent publication that reports the role of EZH2 in nicotine-mediated breast cancer development and progression, we observed significant reduced expression of SUMF1 in breast cancer patient samples with smoking history in comparison to never-smoked patient samples. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we report that TOP1MT is overexpressed in cancer tissues and demonstrate that TOP1MT deficiency attenuates tumor growth in human and mouse models of colon and liver cancer. Due to their mitochondrial dysfunction, TOP1MT-KO cells become addicted to glycolysis, which limits synthetic building blocks and energy supply required for the proliferation of cancer cells in a nutrient-deprived tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, we show that TOP1MT associates with mitoribosomal subunits, ensuring optimal mitochondrial translation and assembly of oxidative phosphorylation complexes that are critical for sustaining tumor growth. The TOP1MT genomic signature profile, based on Top1mt-KO liver cancers, is correlated with enhanced survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Our results highlight the importance of TOP1MT for tumor development, providing a potential rationale to develop TOP1MT-targeted drugs as anticancer therapies. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

A new data integrative approach, based on graphical models, was applied on our multi-modal –omics, and clinical data cohort of metastatic melanoma patients. We found that response to chemotherapy is directly linked to ten gene expression, four methylation variables and PARP1 SNP rs1805407. PARP1 is a DNA repair gene critical for chemotherapy response and for which FDA-approved inhibitors are clinically available (olaparib). We demonstrated that two PARP inhibitors (ABT-888 and olaparib) make SNP carrier cancer cells of various histologic subtypes more sensitive to alkylating agents, but they have no effect in wild-type cells. Furthermore, PARP1 inhibitors act synergistically with chemotherapy in SNP carrier cells (especially in ovarian cancer for which olaparib is FDA-approved), but they are additive at best in wild-type cancer cells. Taken together, our results suggest that the combination of chemotherapy and PARP1 inhibition may benefit the carriers of rs1805407 in the future and may be used in personalized therapy strategies to select patients that are more likely to respond to PARP inhibitors. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Cancer remains one of the biggest threats to human society. There are massive demands for compounds to selectively kill cancerous cells. Earlier studies have shown that bovine α -lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells (BAMLET) becomes cytotoxic against cancer cells in complex with oleic acid {Hoque, M. et. al., PLoSOne8, e68390 (2013)}. In our study, we obtained bovine α-lactalbumin complexed with lanthanum ion (La 3+ -B-α-LA) and determined its high resolution crystal structure. The natural calcium binding site of bovine α-lactalbumin is replaced by lanthanum. The La 3+ complex formation by B-α-apo-LA was also supported by various biophysical methods. Interestingly, our complex, La 3+ -B-α-LA exhibits much greater anticancer activity against breast cancer cells as compared to the reported BAMLET-oleic acid complex. This study shows that La 3+ -B-α-LA complex is preferentially more toxic to MCF-7 cells as compared to KB (oral cancer) and HeLa (cervical) cells, while almost non-toxic to the healthy cells that we studied. Our data indicates that the cytotoxicity of La 3+ -B-α-LA against cancer cells is through apoptotic path way. The higher anticancer activity of La 3+ -B-α-LA is attributable to the requisite structural changes induced in the protein by La 3+ binding as supported by the crystal structure of the complex. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

However, no studies have evaluated vascular pain in patients with colorectal cancer in relation to peripheral venous administration of chemotherapy with or without oxaliplatin. We evaluated oxaliplatin-induced vascular pain using subjective and objective methods. We determined if oxaliplatin induced vascular pain in patients with colorectal cancer using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and a PainVision PS-2100 device. We compared VAS score between chemotherapy regimens with or without oxaliplatin, and between genders. We also examined the correlations of VAS score with pain intensity examined by the PainVision PS-2100, and with age and vessel diameter. A total of 98 patients with colorectal cancer were enrolled in this study, including 78 patients who received oxaliplatin via peripheral venous administration and 20 who received chemotherapy without oxaliplatin. The median VAS scores in patients with and without oxaliplatin were 36.5 (interquartile range 9.0–60.0) and 0 (0–4.0), respectively (P < 0.001), and the median pain intensities according to PainVision were 43.5 (14.3–98) and 36.5 (9.3–58.5), respectively (P < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between VAS and pain intensity (r = 0.584), but no correlation between VAS score and age (r = −0.174) or vessel diameter (r = −0.107).

One of the emerging techniques with tremendous power for lung cancer therapy is magnetic aerosol drug targeting (MADT). The use of a permanent magnet for effective drug delivery in a desired location throughout the lung requires extensive optimization, but it has not been addressed yet. In the present study, the possibility of using a permanent magnet for trapping the particles on a lung tumor is evaluated numerically in the Weibel's model from G0 to G3. The effect of different parameters is considered on the efficiency of particle deposition in a tumor located on a distant position of the lung bronchi and bronchioles. Also, the effective position of the magnetic source, tumor size, and location are the objectives for particle deposition. The results show that a limited particle deposition occurs on the lung branches in passive targeting. However, the incorporation of a permanent magnet next to the tumor enhanced the particle deposition fraction on G2 to up to 49% for the particles of 7 µm diameter. Optimizing the magnet size could also improve the particle deposition fraction by 68%. It was also shown that the utilization of MADT is essential for effective drug delivery to the tumors located on the lower wall of airway branches given the dominance of the air velocity and resultant drag force in this region. The results demonstrated the high competence and necessity of MADT as a noninvasive drug delivery method for lung cancer therapy." ;

Adjuvant chemotherapy has significantly reduced mortality but increased cognitive impairments, including attention function, making quality of life issues a crucial concern. This study enrolled nineteen breast cancer patients who were treated with standard chemotherapy within 6 months and 20 sex-matched healthy controls to investigate the brain effects of chemotherapy. All participants underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) with mean fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (mfALFF) analysis and were correlated with neuropsychological tests, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised (CAMS-R), and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), to explore the possible underlying mechanism of cognitive alternations. We found increased mfALFF over the frontoparietal lobe and decreased mfALFF over the occipital lobe in the cancer patients compared with the healthy controls; the altered brain regions may be associated with the dorsal attention network (DAN) and may be explained by a compensatory mechanism. Both MMSE and CAMS-R scores showed a positive correlation with mfALFF in the occipital lobe but a negative correlation in the frontoparietal lobe. By contrast, IES-R scores showed a positive correlation with mfALFF in the frontoparietal lobe but a negative correlation in the occipital lobe. These alterations are potentially related to the effects of both chemotherapy and psychological distress.

Mutations that occur in certain splicing factor genes themselves have been implicated in many cancers, particularly myelodysplastic syndromes. Small molecules that target splicing factors have been developed as therapies to preferentially induce apoptosis in these cancer cells.

There have been many attempts to identify markers and key pathways induced throughout EMT but the process is complex and depends on the cancer type and tumour microenvironment. Here we used the colon cancer cell line HT29, which stably overexpressed Snail, the key transcription factor in early EMT, as a model for colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with a pro-metastatic phenotype. We investigated miRNA expression regulation during that phenotypic switching. We found that overexpression of Snail in HT29 cells triggered significant changes in individual miRNA levels but did not change the global efficiency of miRNA processing. Snail abundance repressed the expression of miR-192 and miR-194 and increased miR-205, let-7i and SNORD13 levels. These identified changes correlated with the reported transcriptomic alterations in Snail-overexpressing HT29 cells. We also investigated how Snail affected the miRNA content of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from HT29 cells.

        fabio:abstract    "Solid malignancies are associated with the development of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP). This study aimed to evaluate the risk factors for PJP among patients with lung cancer. This retrospective case-control study compared patients who had lung cancer with PJP (n = 112) or without PJP (n = 336) matched according to age, sex, histopathology, and stage. PJP definition was based on (i) positive PCR or direct immunofluorescence results for pneumocystis, (ii) clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities that were consistent with a pneumonic process, and (iii) received targeted PJP treatment. The development of PJP was associated with radiotherapy (RTx), concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRTx), lymphopenia, and prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (20 mg of prednisolone equivalent per day for ≥3 weeks). Multivariate analysis revealed independent associations with prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06–3.63; p = 0.032) and CCRTx (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.27–3.43; p = 0.004). Steroid use was frequently related to RTx pneumonitis or esophagitis (29 patients, 43.3%). Prolonged high-dose steroid therapy and CCRTx were risk factors for PJP development among patients with lung cancer. As these patients had a poor prognosis, clinicians should consider PJP prophylaxis for high-risk patients with lung cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we compared The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) breast cancer genomic datasets (array and next generation sequencing (NGS) data) in detecting genomic alterations in clinically relevant genes. We performed an in silico analysis to determine the concordance in the frequencies of actionable mutations and copy number alterations/aberrations (CNAs) in the two most common breast cancer histologies, invasive lobular and invasive ductal carcinoma. We found that targeted sequencing identified a larger number of mutational hotspots and clinically significant amplifications that would have been missed by WES and SNP arrays in many actionable genes such as PIK3CA, EGFR, AKT3, FGFR1, ERBB2, ERBB3 and ESR1. The striking differences between the number of mutational hotspots and CNAs generated from these platforms highlight a number of factors that should be considered in the interpretation of array and NGS-based genomic data for precision medicine. Targeted panel sequencing was preferable to WES to define the full spectrum of somatic mutations present in a tumor. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Several oxaliplatin transporters were previously identified but their relative contributions to determining oxaliplatin tumour responses and gastrointestinal tumour cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin remains unclear. We studied clinical associations between tumour expression of oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes and patient response to oxaliplatin, then experimentally verified associations found with MRP2 in models of human gastrointestinal cancer. Among 18 oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes, MRP2 was the only one to be differentially expressed in the tumours of colorectal cancer patients who did or did not respond to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Over-expression of MRP2 (endogenously in HepG2 and PANC-1 cells, or induced by stable transfection of HEK293 cells) decreased oxaliplatin accumulation and cytotoxicity but those deficits were reversed by inhibition of MRP2 with myricetin or siRNA knockdown. Mice bearing subcutaneous HepG2 tumour xenografts were sensitised to oxaliplatin antitumour activity by concurrent myricetin treatment with little or no increase in toxicity. In conclusion, MRP2 limits oxaliplatin accumulation and response in human gastrointestinal cancer. Screening tumour MRP2 expression levels, to select patients for treatment with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy alone or in combination with a MRP2 inhibitor, could improve treatment outcomes. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

We compare optimized gene signatures for cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin responses in the same cell lines and validate each signature using data from patients with cancer. Supervised support vector machine learning is used to derive gene sets whose expression is related to the cell line GI50 values by backwards feature selection with cross-validation. Specific genes and functional pathways distinguishing sensitive from resistant cell lines are identified by contrasting signatures obtained at extreme and median GI50 thresholds. Ensembles of gene signatures at different thresholds are combined to reduce the dependence on specific GI50 values for predicting drug responses. The most accurate gene signatures for each platin are: cisplatin: BARD1, BCL2, BCL2L1, CDKN2C, FAAP24, FEN1, MAP3K1, MAPK13, MAPK3, NFKB1, NFKB2, SLC22A5, SLC31A2, TLR4, and TWIST1; carboplatin: AKT1, EIF3K, ERCC1, GNGT1, GSR, MTHFR, NEDD4L, NLRP1, NRAS, RAF1, SGK1, TIGD1, TP53, VEGFB, and VEGFC; and oxaliplatin: BRAF, FCGR2A, IGF1, MSH2, NAGK, NFE2L2, NQO1, PANK3, SLC47A1, SLCO1B1, and UGT1A1. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with bladder, ovarian, and colorectal cancer were used to test the cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin signatures, resulting in 71.0%, 60.2%, and 54.5% accuracies in predicting disease recurrence and 59%, 61%, and 72% accuracies in predicting remission, respectively. One cisplatin signature predicted 100% of recurrence in non-smoking patients with bladder cancer (57% disease-free; N = 19), and 79% recurrence in smokers (62% disease-free; N = 35).

MTH1 dephosphorylates oxidized nucleotides, thereby preventing their incorporation into DNA and protecting tumour cells from oxidative DNA damage. Inhibitors of MTH1 (TH588 and (S)-crizotinib) were shown to reduce cancer cell viability. However, the MTH1-dependency of the anti-cancer effects of these drugs has recently been questioned. Here, we have assessed anti-tumour effects of TH588 and (S)-crizotinib in patient-derived 3D colorectal cancer cultures. Hypoxia and reoxygenation – conditions that increase intracellular ROS levels – increased sensitivity to (S)-crizotinib, but not to TH588. (S)-crizotinib reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-MET and ErbB3 whereas TH588 induced a mitotic cell cycle arrest, which was not affected by adding ROS-modulating compounds. Furthermore, we show that both compounds induced DNA damage that could not be prevented by adding the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Moreover, adding ROS-modulating compounds did not alter the reduction in viability in response to TH588 and (S)-crizotinib. We conclude that TH588 and (S)-crizotinib have very clear and distinct anti-tumour effects in 3D colorectal cancer cultures, but that these effects most likely occur through distinct and ROS-independent mechanisms. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Histological iron imaging and contrast-agent free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect these deposits, but their presence in human cancer, and correlation with immunotherapeutic response is largely untested. Here, primarily using these iron imaging approaches, we evaluated the spatial distribution of polarized macrophage populations containing high endogenous levels of iron in preclinical murine models and human breast cancer, and used them as metabolic biomarkers to correlate TAM infiltration with response to immunotherapy in preclinical trials. Macrophage-targeted inhibition of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) by immunotherapy was confirmed to inhibit macrophage accumulation and slow mammary tumor growth in mouse models while also reducing hemosiderin iron-laden TAM accumulation as measured by both iron histology and in vivo iron MRI (FeMRI). Spatial profiling of TAM iron deposit infiltration defined regions of maximal accumulation and response to the CSF1R inhibitor, and revealed differences between microenvironments of human cancer according to levels of polarized macrophage iron accumulation in stromal margins. We therefore demonstrate that iron deposition serves as an endogenous metabolic imaging biomarker of TAM infiltration in breast cancer that has high translational potential for evaluation of immunotherapeutic response. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

The AP2 family also acts as a tumor suppressor. Here we found that p73 and AP2 are able to activate NEU4, a neuraminidase gene, which removes the terminal sialic acid residues from cancer-associated glycans. Under serum starvation, NEU4 was up-regulated and one of the NEU4 target glycans, sialyl Lewis X, was decreased, whereas p73 and AP2 were up-regulated. Sialyl Lewis X levels were not, however, decreased under starvation conditions in p73- or AP2-knockdown cells. p53 and AP2 underwent protein-protein interactions, exerting synergistic effects to activate p21, and interaction of p53 with AP2 was lost in cells expressing the L350P mutation of p53. The homologous residues in p63 and p73 are L423 and L377, respectively. The synergistic effect of p53/p63 with AP2 to activate genes was lost with the L350P/L423P mutation in p53/p63, but p73 bearing the L377P mutation was able to interact with AP2 and exerted its normal synergistic effects. We propose that p73 and AP2 synergistically activate the NEU4 promoter in colon cancer cells. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Treatment with increasing concentrations of HspNPs (25, 50, 75 and 100 µg/mL) resulted in 9.1-, 7-, 12.5- and 12.7-fold in increase in apoptotic cell number. Optimum doses of Hsp and HspNPs were found to increase oxidative damage in C6 glioma cells. MDA levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were found to be significantly elevated at 75 and 100 µg/mL exposure concentration of HspNPs with (p = .002) and (p = .018), respectively for 48-h treatment.

GO exhibits pH-dependent fluorescence emission in the visible/near-infrared, providing a possibility of molecular imaging and pH-sensing. It is also water soluble and has a substantial platform for functionalization, allowing for the delivery of multiple therapeutics. GO physical properties are modified to enhance cellular internalization, producing fluorescent nanoflakes with low (<15%) cytotoxicity at the imaging concentrations of 15 μg/mL. As a result, at lower flake sizes GO rapidly internalizes into HeLa cells with the following 70% fluorescence based clearance at 24 h, assessed by its characteristic emission in red/near-IR. pH-dependence of GO emission is utilized to provide the sensing of acidic extracellular environments of cancer cells. The results demonstrate diminishing green/red (550/630 nm) fluorescence intensity ratios for HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells in comparison to HEK-293 healthy cells suggesting a potential use of GO as a non-invasive optical sensor for cancer microenvironments.

        fabio:abstract    "Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells, represents early stages of metastasis and is a promising target in colorectal cancer (CRC) therapy. There have been many attempts to identify markers and key pathways induced throughout EMT but the process is complex and depends on the cancer type and tumour microenvironment. Here we used the colon cancer cell line HT29, which stably overexpressed Snail, the key transcription factor in early EMT, as a model for colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with a pro-metastatic phenotype. We investigated miRNA expression regulation during that phenotypic switching. We found that overexpression of Snail in HT29 cells triggered significant changes in individual miRNA levels but did not change the global efficiency of miRNA processing. Snail abundance repressed the expression of miR-192 and miR-194 and increased miR-205, let-7i and SNORD13 levels. These identified changes correlated with the reported transcriptomic alterations in Snail-overexpressing HT29 cells. We also investigated how Snail affected the miRNA content of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from HT29 cells. Our data suggest that the presence of Snail significantly alters the complex mRNA/miRNA interactions in the early steps of metastasis and also has an impact on the content of EVs released from HT29 cells. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Solid malignancies are associated with the development of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP). This study aimed to evaluate the risk factors for PJP among patients with lung cancer. This retrospective case-control study compared patients who had lung cancer with PJP (n = 112) or without PJP (n = 336) matched according to age, sex, histopathology, and stage. PJP definition was based on (i) positive PCR or direct immunofluorescence results for pneumocystis, (ii) clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities that were consistent with a pneumonic process, and (iii) received targeted PJP treatment. The development of PJP was associated with radiotherapy (RTx), concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRTx), lymphopenia, and prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (20 mg of prednisolone equivalent per day for ≥3 weeks). Multivariate analysis revealed independent associations with prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06–3.63; p = 0.032) and CCRTx (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.27–3.43; p = 0.004). Steroid use was frequently related to RTx pneumonitis or esophagitis (29 patients, 43.3%). Prolonged high-dose steroid therapy and CCRTx were risk factors for PJP development among patients with lung cancer. As these patients had a poor prognosis, clinicians should consider PJP prophylaxis for high-risk patients with lung cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we compared The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) breast cancer genomic datasets (array and next generation sequencing (NGS) data) in detecting genomic alterations in clinically relevant genes. We performed an in silico analysis to determine the concordance in the frequencies of actionable mutations and copy number alterations/aberrations (CNAs) in the two most common breast cancer histologies, invasive lobular and invasive ductal carcinoma. We found that targeted sequencing identified a larger number of mutational hotspots and clinically significant amplifications that would have been missed by WES and SNP arrays in many actionable genes such as PIK3CA, EGFR, AKT3, FGFR1, ERBB2, ERBB3 and ESR1. The striking differences between the number of mutational hotspots and CNAs generated from these platforms highlight a number of factors that should be considered in the interpretation of array and NGS-based genomic data for precision medicine. Targeted panel sequencing was preferable to WES to define the full spectrum of somatic mutations present in a tumor. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Several oxaliplatin transporters were previously identified but their relative contributions to determining oxaliplatin tumour responses and gastrointestinal tumour cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin remains unclear. We studied clinical associations between tumour expression of oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes and patient response to oxaliplatin, then experimentally verified associations found with MRP2 in models of human gastrointestinal cancer. Among 18 oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes, MRP2 was the only one to be differentially expressed in the tumours of colorectal cancer patients who did or did not respond to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Over-expression of MRP2 (endogenously in HepG2 and PANC-1 cells, or induced by stable transfection of HEK293 cells) decreased oxaliplatin accumulation and cytotoxicity but those deficits were reversed by inhibition of MRP2 with myricetin or siRNA knockdown. Mice bearing subcutaneous HepG2 tumour xenografts were sensitised to oxaliplatin antitumour activity by concurrent myricetin treatment with little or no increase in toxicity. In conclusion, MRP2 limits oxaliplatin accumulation and response in human gastrointestinal cancer. Screening tumour MRP2 expression levels, to select patients for treatment with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy alone or in combination with a MRP2 inhibitor, could improve treatment outcomes. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

We compare optimized gene signatures for cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin responses in the same cell lines and validate each signature using data from patients with cancer. Supervised support vector machine learning is used to derive gene sets whose expression is related to the cell line GI50 values by backwards feature selection with cross-validation. Specific genes and functional pathways distinguishing sensitive from resistant cell lines are identified by contrasting signatures obtained at extreme and median GI50 thresholds. Ensembles of gene signatures at different thresholds are combined to reduce the dependence on specific GI50 values for predicting drug responses. The most accurate gene signatures for each platin are: cisplatin: BARD1, BCL2, BCL2L1, CDKN2C, FAAP24, FEN1, MAP3K1, MAPK13, MAPK3, NFKB1, NFKB2, SLC22A5, SLC31A2, TLR4, and TWIST1; carboplatin: AKT1, EIF3K, ERCC1, GNGT1, GSR, MTHFR, NEDD4L, NLRP1, NRAS, RAF1, SGK1, TIGD1, TP53, VEGFB, and VEGFC; and oxaliplatin: BRAF, FCGR2A, IGF1, MSH2, NAGK, NFE2L2, NQO1, PANK3, SLC47A1, SLCO1B1, and UGT1A1. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with bladder, ovarian, and colorectal cancer were used to test the cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin signatures, resulting in 71.0%, 60.2%, and 54.5% accuracies in predicting disease recurrence and 59%, 61%, and 72% accuracies in predicting remission, respectively. One cisplatin signature predicted 100% of recurrence in non-smoking patients with bladder cancer (57% disease-free; N = 19), and 79% recurrence in smokers (62% disease-free; N = 35).

MTH1 dephosphorylates oxidized nucleotides, thereby preventing their incorporation into DNA and protecting tumour cells from oxidative DNA damage. Inhibitors of MTH1 (TH588 and (S)-crizotinib) were shown to reduce cancer cell viability. However, the MTH1-dependency of the anti-cancer effects of these drugs has recently been questioned. Here, we have assessed anti-tumour effects of TH588 and (S)-crizotinib in patient-derived 3D colorectal cancer cultures. Hypoxia and reoxygenation – conditions that increase intracellular ROS levels – increased sensitivity to (S)-crizotinib, but not to TH588. (S)-crizotinib reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-MET and ErbB3 whereas TH588 induced a mitotic cell cycle arrest, which was not affected by adding ROS-modulating compounds. Furthermore, we show that both compounds induced DNA damage that could not be prevented by adding the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Moreover, adding ROS-modulating compounds did not alter the reduction in viability in response to TH588 and (S)-crizotinib. We conclude that TH588 and (S)-crizotinib have very clear and distinct anti-tumour effects in 3D colorectal cancer cultures, but that these effects most likely occur through distinct and ROS-independent mechanisms. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Histological iron imaging and contrast-agent free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect these deposits, but their presence in human cancer, and correlation with immunotherapeutic response is largely untested. Here, primarily using these iron imaging approaches, we evaluated the spatial distribution of polarized macrophage populations containing high endogenous levels of iron in preclinical murine models and human breast cancer, and used them as metabolic biomarkers to correlate TAM infiltration with response to immunotherapy in preclinical trials. Macrophage-targeted inhibition of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) by immunotherapy was confirmed to inhibit macrophage accumulation and slow mammary tumor growth in mouse models while also reducing hemosiderin iron-laden TAM accumulation as measured by both iron histology and in vivo iron MRI (FeMRI). Spatial profiling of TAM iron deposit infiltration defined regions of maximal accumulation and response to the CSF1R inhibitor, and revealed differences between microenvironments of human cancer according to levels of polarized macrophage iron accumulation in stromal margins. We therefore demonstrate that iron deposition serves as an endogenous metabolic imaging biomarker of TAM infiltration in breast cancer that has high translational potential for evaluation of immunotherapeutic response. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

The AP2 family also acts as a tumor suppressor. Here we found that p73 and AP2 are able to activate NEU4, a neuraminidase gene, which removes the terminal sialic acid residues from cancer-associated glycans. Under serum starvation, NEU4 was up-regulated and one of the NEU4 target glycans, sialyl Lewis X, was decreased, whereas p73 and AP2 were up-regulated. Sialyl Lewis X levels were not, however, decreased under starvation conditions in p73- or AP2-knockdown cells. p53 and AP2 underwent protein-protein interactions, exerting synergistic effects to activate p21, and interaction of p53 with AP2 was lost in cells expressing the L350P mutation of p53. The homologous residues in p63 and p73 are L423 and L377, respectively. The synergistic effect of p53/p63 with AP2 to activate genes was lost with the L350P/L423P mutation in p53/p63, but p73 bearing the L377P mutation was able to interact with AP2 and exerted its normal synergistic effects. We propose that p73 and AP2 synergistically activate the NEU4 promoter in colon cancer cells. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Treatment of C6 glioma cells with HspNPs for 24 and 48 h resulted in dose- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability, with approximate IC50 of 28 and 21 μg/mL, respectively (p = .036 for 24 h, p = .025 for 48 h). The percentage of PCNA positive cells decreased to 20% and 10%, respectively, for Hsp- and HspNP-treated cells at concentration of 100 µg/mL. Treatment with increasing concentrations of HspNPs (25, 50, 75 and 100 µg/mL) resulted in 9.1-, 7-, 12.5- and 12.7-fold in increase in apoptotic cell number. Optimum doses of Hsp and HspNPs were found to increase oxidative damage in C6 glioma cells. MDA levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were found to be significantly elevated at 75 and 100 µg/mL exposure concentration of HspNPs with (p = .002) and (p = .018), respectively for 48-h treatment.

GO exhibits pH-dependent fluorescence emission in the visible/near-infrared, providing a possibility of molecular imaging and pH-sensing. It is also water soluble and has a substantial platform for functionalization, allowing for the delivery of multiple therapeutics. GO physical properties are modified to enhance cellular internalization, producing fluorescent nanoflakes with low (<15%) cytotoxicity at the imaging concentrations of 15 μg/mL. As a result, at lower flake sizes GO rapidly internalizes into HeLa cells with the following 70% fluorescence based clearance at 24 h, assessed by its characteristic emission in red/near-IR. pH-dependence of GO emission is utilized to provide the sensing of acidic extracellular environments of cancer cells. The results demonstrate diminishing green/red (550/630 nm) fluorescence intensity ratios for HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells in comparison to HEK-293 healthy cells suggesting a potential use of GO as a non-invasive optical sensor for cancer microenvironments.

A total of 19,785 newly diagnosed CC patients were registered during 2010–2016, among them only 16,946 (85.6%) with primary CC tumor. There was no difference in treatment modality between DM and non-DM patients. However intergroup assessment showed that type 2DM have significantly higher rate of mortality in both overall mortality (28.3%) and CC-specific (11.7%) as compared to Type 1DM (17.3%; 5.5%) and non DM patients (12.7%; 9.1%) (p < 0.001). Within group assessments showed that Type 2DM patients have better quality of life (mean 7.13 ± 3.67) (p < 0.001) and less distress levels (mean 2.41 ± 0.63) (p < 0.011) as compared to type1 DM (meant 10.54 ± 2.11; 3.19 ± 1.07). This study concluded that T2DM prognostic effect still remained after adjusting demographic and clinical parameters. Type 1 diabetes mellitus showed better OS and CSS then type2 DM. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Despite the widening range of high-throughput platforms and exponential growth of generated data volume, the validation of biomarkers discovered from large-scale data remains a challenging field. In order to tackle cancer heterogeneity and comply with the data dimensionality, a number of network and pathway approaches were invented but rarely systematically applied to this task. We propose a new method, called NEAmarker, for finding sensitive and robust biomarkers at the pathway level. scores from network enrichment analysis transform the original space of altered genes into a lower-dimensional space of pathways. These dimensions are then correlated with phenotype variables. The method was first tested using in vitro data from three anti-cancer drug screens and then on clinical data of The Cancer Genome Atlas. It proved superior to the single-gene and alternative enrichment analyses in terms of (1) universal applicability to different data types with a possibility of cross-platform integration, (2) consistency of the discovered correlates between independent drug screens, and (3) ability to explain differential survival of treated patients. Our new screen of anti-cancer compounds validated the performance of multivariate models of drug sensitivity. The previously proposed methods of enrichment analysis could achieve comparable levels of performance in certain tests. However, only our method could discover predictors of both in vitro response and patient survival given administration of the same drug. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

SPIONs entrapped in the core of the nanocomplex may act as a hyperthermia agent and generate localized heat upon excitation with an alternating magnetic field (AMF), thus enabling a thermo-chemotherapy strategy for cancer treatment. Accordingly, the cytotoxic effect and the mode of cell death triggered by the nanocomplex in combination with AMF were evaluated on two different cancer cell lines with various folate receptor (FR) expression levels, including KB nasopharyngeal cancer cells overexpressing FRs as the model and MCF-7 breast cancer cells with low level of FRs as the blank sample. The obtained results showed that KB cell death was greater than the cell death observed in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, a majority of cell death in both cell lines were related to apoptosis when the folate-modified nanocomplex was used instated of the non-folate-modified nanocomplex. Therefore, functionalizing the nanocomplex with folate modulated the response to thermo-chemotherapy by shifting the cell death pathways toward apoptosis." ;

We examined TILs grades of pretreatment cancer tissue specimens and residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab and determined the predictive utility of the TILs grade in pathological complete response (pCR) and the prognostic power of TILs in HER2-positive breast cancer. This cohort study included 128 HER2-positive breast cancer who received NAC with trastuzumab. TILs grading of the tumor stroma in pretreatment biopsy specimens and residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab was categorized as low, intermediate, and high based on the criteria of the International Working Group. In current study, the pCR rate was 64.8%, and the Relapse-free survival (RFS) was significantly worse in the non-pCR group than in the pCR group. The pCR rate correlated with the TILs grade in pretreatment tumors. In 45 non-pCR patients, TILs grade was higher in the residual tumors than in the pretreatment tumors. The RFS was significantly better in residual tumors with high TILs grade than those with low TILs grade (p = 0.033). In conclusion, assessment of the TILs grade in residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab might be necessary to determine patients with good prognosis among those who do not achieve pCR. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

However, their clinical importance in gallbladder cancer has rarely been explored. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of surgical intervention and the effectiveness of preoperative test on neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) for predicting the prognosis in gallbladder cancer patients. In this study, a total of 255 gallbladder cancer patients were retrospectively selected. For each patient, we recorded his/her treatment algorithm (with or without surgery) and their preoperative inflammatory biomarkers, as well as their detailed survival information for 5 years. A total of 216 patients received surgical intervention and the other 39 chose conservative treatment. The median survival time was 4.6 months for non-surgical group (P < 0.001), and 12.2 months for surgical intervention group. Among the surgical group, ROC analysis showed the AUC of NLR, PLR and MLR were 0.675 (95% CI: 0.600 to 0.751, P < 0.001), 0.599 (95% CI: 0.520 to 0.677, P = 0.017) and 0.607 (95% CI: 0.529 to 0.686, P = 0.009), respectively. In conclusion, surgical intervention did improve the overall survival, and elevated NLR and MLR before surgery are associated with shorter OS of GBC patients. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Most targeting strategies of anticancer drug delivery systems (DDSs) rely on the surface functionalization of nanocarriers with specific ligands, which trigger the internalization in cancer cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The endocytosis implies the entrapment of DDSs in acidic vesicles (endosomes and lysosomes) and their eventual ejection by exocytosis. This process, intrinsic to eukaryotic cells, is one of the main drawbacks of DDSs because it reduces the drug bioavailability in the intracellular environment. The escape of DDSs from the acidic vesicles is, therefore, crucial to enhance the therapeutic performance at low drug dose. To this end, we developed a multifunctionalized DDS that combines high specificity towards cancer cells with endosomal escape capabilities. Doxorubicin-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles were functionalized with polyethylenimine, a polymer commonly used to induce endosomal rupture, and hyaluronic acid, which binds to CD44 receptors, overexpressed in cancer cells. We show irrefutable proof that the developed DDS can escape the endosomal pathway upon polymeric functionalization. Interestingly, the combination of the two polymers resulted in higher endosomal escape efficiency than the polyethylenimine coating alone. Hyaluronic acid additionally provides the system with cancer targeting capability and enzymatically controlled drug release. Thanks to this multifunctionality, the engineered DDS had cytotoxicity comparable to the pure drug whilst displaying high specificity towards cancer cells. The polymeric engineering here developed enhances the performance of DDS at low drug dose, holding great potential for anticancer therapeutic applications. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Using multiple aggressive murine models of triple-negative breast cancer, we have recently demonstrated that the early administration of oncolytic Maraba virus (MRB) prior to surgical resection of the primary tumor is sufficient to minimize the metastatic burden, protect against tumor rechallenge, cure a fraction of the mice and sensitize refractory tumors to immune checkpoint blockade without the need for further treatment. Here, we apply our surgical model to other OVs: Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Adenovirus (Ad), Reovirus (Reo) and Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and show that all of the tested OVs could positively change the outcome of the treated animals. The growth of the primary and secondary tumors was differently affected by the various OVs and most of the viruses conferred survival benefits in this neoadjuvant setting despite the absence of direct treatment following rechallenge. This study establishes that OV-therapy confers long-term protection when administered in the pre-operative window of opportunity. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Recent data indicate that p130Cas association to ErbB2 protects ErbB2 from degradation, thus enhancing tumorigenesis. Therefore, inhibiting p130Cas/ErbB2 interaction might represent a new therapeutic strategy to target breast cancer. Here we demonstrate by performing Molecular Modeling, Molecular Dynamics, dot blot, ELISA and fluorescence quenching experiments, that p130Cas binds directly to ErbB2. Then, by structure-based virtual screening, we identified two potential inhibitors of p130Cas/ErbB2 interaction. Their experimental validation was performed in vitro and in ErbB2-positive breast cancer cellular models. The results highlight that both compounds interfere with p130Cas/ErbB2 binding and significantly affect cell proliferation and sensitivity to Trastuzumab.

A large number of clinical applications have revealed that Trametes robiniophila Μurr. (Huaier) exhibits an anti-tumour effect. However, loss of the bioactive components of Huaier during the extraction procedure with water is unavoidable, and the underlying mechanism of the anti-cancer effect of Huaier remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer effect of Huaier n-butanol extract, which contained 51.4% total flavonoids, on HGC27, MGC803, and AGS human GC cell lines in vitro. At a low concentration, Huaier n-butanol extract inhibited the growth of these GC cell types, induced cell cycle arrest and reduced cell metastasis. Moreover, Huaier n-butanol extract suppressed the c-Myc-Bmi1 signalling pathway, and overexpression of Bmi1 reversed the effects of Huaier n-butanol extract on GC cells. Thus, our findings indicate that Huaier n-butanol extract suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of GC cells via a c-Myc-Bmi1-mediated approach, providing a new perspective for our understanding of the anti-tumour effects of Huaier. These results suggest that Huaier n-butanol extract could be an attractive therapeutic adjuvant for the treatment of human GC. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

In the present study, we screened the anticancer potential of supernatant metabolites from eight native haloarchaeal strains obtained from a culture collection in Iran. Five human cancer cell lines including breast, lung, prostate and also human fibroblast cells as the normal control were used in the present study. Moreover, to evaluate the anti-tumor effect of the selected supernatant, inhibition of sphere formation and tumor development was assessed in-vitro and in-vivo, respectively. Among all strains, supernatant metabolites from Halobacterium salinarum IBRC M10715 had the most potent cytotoxic effect on prostate cancer cell lines (IC50 = 0.5 mg/mL) without any effects on normal cells. It significantly increased both early and late apoptosis (about 11% and 9%, respectively) in the androgen-dependent PC3 cell line, reduced sphere formation ability of DU145 and PC3 cells with down-regulation of SOX2 gene expression. Furthermore, our results revealed that tumors developed in nude mice significantly shrank post intratumor injection of metabolites of the haloarchaeal strain. In conclusion, we suggested here for the first time that supernatant metabolites from Halobacterium salinarum IBRC M10715 could be a novel component against prostate cancer in-vitro and in-vivo with remarkable reduction in stem-like properties of tumor. © 2017, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

The main HNSCC risk factors are tobacco, excessive alcohol use, and the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV positive (+) cancers are etiologically different from other HNSCC and often show better prognosis. The current knowledge regarding HNSCC miRNA profiles is still incomplete especially in the context of HPV+ cancer. Thus, we analyzed 61 freshly collected primary oral (OSCC) and oropharyngeal (OPSCC) SCC samples. HPV DNA and RNA was found in 21% cases. The Illumina whole-genome small-RNA profiling by next-generation sequencing was done on 22 samples and revealed 7 specific miRNAs to HPV+ OSCC, 77 to HPV+ OPSCC, and additional 3 shared with both; 51 miRNAs were specific to HPV− OPSCC, 62 to HPV− OSCC, and 31 shared with both. The results for 9 miRNAs (miR-9, -21, -29a, -100, -106b, -143 and -145) were assessed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction on the whole study population. The data was additionally confirmed by reanalyzing publicly available miRNA sequencing Cancer Genome Atlas consortium (TCGA) HNSCC data. Cell signaling pathway analysis revealed differences between HPV+ and HPV− HNSCC. Our findings compared with literature data revealed extensive heterogeneity of miRNA deregulation with only several miRNAs consistently affected, and miR-9 being the most likely HPV related miRNA. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Resistance to 5-Fluorouracil chemotherapy is a major cause of therapeutic failure in colon cancer cure. Development of combined therapies constitutes an effective strategy to inhibit cancer cells and prevent the emergence of drug resistance. For this purpose, we investigated the anti-tumoral effect of thirteen phenolic compounds, from the Tunisian quince Cydonia oblonga Miller, alone or combined to 5-FU, on the human 5-FU-resistant LS174-R colon cancer cells in comparison to parental cells. Our results showed that only Kaempferol was able to chemo-sensitize 5-FU-resistant LS174-R cells. This phenolic compound combined with 5-FU exerted synergistic inhibitory effect on cell viability. This combination enhanced the apoptosis and induced cell cycle arrest of both chemo-resistant and sensitive cells through impacting the expression levels of different cellular effectors. Kaempferol also blocked the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and modulated the expression of JAK/STAT3, MAPK, PI3K/AKT and NF-κB. In silico docking analysis suggested that the potent anti-tumoral effect of Kaempferol, compared to its two analogs (Kaempferol 3-O-glucoside and Kampferol 3-O-rutinoside), can be explained by the absence of glucosyl groups. Overall, our data propose Kaempferol as a potential chemotherapeutic agent to be used alone or in combination with 5-FU to overcome colon cancer drug resistance. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Considering the high prevalence and mortality rate of colorectal cancer, in this study we tried to design and validate a standard printed form and evaluate oncologists’ and nurses’ adherence to this form. This cross-sectional study was performed in Omid hospital, Mashhad, Iran from January 2015 to October 2015. A Chemotherapy form including various demographic and clinical parameters and approved chemotherapy regimens for colorectal cancer was designed by the clinical pharmacist and validated by clinical oncologists working in this center. All eligible patients admitted in this center during this period of time were included in the study. Adherence of the oncologists and nurses to this form and probable medication errors were identified by the pharmacy student. Sixty-seven patients with colorectal cancer and a total of 251 chemotherapy courses were evaluated. All patients received regimens compatible with developed form but in 206 courses (98.56%) of chemotherapy dosing error happened and in most of cases patients received lower than calculated dose (37.8%). Three errors occurred in administration step by nurses which they infused the medication in shorter than recommended duration. In general, oncologists’ adherence with developed form for chemotherapy of colorectal cancer was relatively high, except in dose calculation. Avoiding from rounding the calculated medications’ doses and precise calculation of patients’ body surface area can prevent most of medication errors and reduce risk of adverse drug reaction occurrence. © 2017, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

Nevertheless, the importance of transfusion timing is still unclear. The primary purpose of this study is to appraise whether the receipt of intraoperative blood transfusion (BT) differ from postoperative BT in regards to cancer outcomes in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients treated with nephrectomy. Data on 1168 patients with RCC, who underwent radical or partial nephrectomy as primary therapy between 1988–2013 were analyzed. PBT was defined as transfusion of allogeneic red blood cells (RBC) during surgery or the postsurgical period. Survival was analyzed and compared using the Kaplan–Meier method with the log-rank test. Of 1168 patients, 198 patients (16.9%) received a PBT. Including 117 intraoperative BT and 81 postoperative BT. Only 21 (10.6%) patients required both intraoperative and postoperative BT. On multivariate analyses, receipt of PBT was associated with significantly worse local disease recurrence (HR: 2.4; P = 0.017), metastatic progression (HR: 2.7; P = 0.005), cancer-specific mortality (HR: 3.5; P = 0.002) and all-cause mortality (HR: 2.1; P = 0.005). Nevertheless, postoperative BT was not independently associated with increased risk of local recurrence (p = 0.1), metastatic progression (P = 0.16) or kidney cancer death (P = 0.63), yet did significantly increase the risk of overall mortality (HR: 2.6; P = 0.004). In the current study, intraoperative transfusion of allogeneic RBC is associated with increased risks of cancer recurrence and mortality following nephrectomy. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

For this reason novel therapies accounting for PDAC peculiarities, such as the relevant stromal reaction, are urgently needed. Here adipose mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (AD-MSC) have been armed to constantly release a soluble trimeric and multimeric variant of the known anti-cancer TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (sTRAIL). This cancer gene therapy strategy was in vitro challenged demonstrating that sTRAIL was thermally stable and able to induce apoptosis in the PDAC lines BxPC-3, MIA PaCa-2 and against primary PDAC cells. sTRAIL released by AD-MSC relocated into the tumor stroma was able to significantly counteract tumor growth in vivo with a significant reduction in tumor size, in cytokeratin-7+ cells and by an anti-angiogenic effect. In parallel, histology on PDAC specimens form patients (n = 19) was performed to investigate the levels of TRAIL DR4, DR5 and OPG receptors generating promising insights on the possible clinical translation of our approach. These results indicate that adipose MSC can very efficiently vehicle a novel TRAIL variant opening unexplored opportunities for PDAC treatment. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Therefore, identification of novel therapeutic targets involved in melanoma progression is urgently needed for developing effective therapeutic methods. Overexpression of interleukin-13 receptor α2 (IL13Rα2) is observed in several cancer types including glioma and pancreatic cancer. Although IL13Rα2 is implicated in the progression of various types of cancer, its expression and roles in the malignant melanoma have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we showed that IL13Rα2 was expressed in approximately 7.5% melanoma patients. While IL13Rα2 expression in human melanoma cells decreased their proliferation in vitro, it promoted in vivo tumour growth and angiogenesis in melanoma xenograft mouse model. We also found that the expression of amphiregulin, a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, was correlated with IL13Rα2 expression in cultured melanoma cells, xenograft tumour tissues and melanoma clinical samples. Furthermore, expression of amphiregulin promoted tumour growth, implicating causal relationship between the expression of IL13Rα2 and amphiregulin. These results suggest that IL13Rα2 enhances tumorigenicity by inducing angiogenesis in malignant melanoma, and serves as a potential therapeutic target of malignant melanoma. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Experiment in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines demonstrated up-regulation of PKD2 led to high expression of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vim, mmp9 et al.) and EMT transcription factors(zeb1, twist, snail), and the results were reversed when PKD2 was knocked down. Further investigation showed that abrogation of PKD2 inhibited A549 cell migration, invasion, proliferation and induced cell arrest in G2/M phase.

We showed for the first time that Raman imaging can be used to distinguish successfully between glycosylated and nonglycosylated proteins in normal and cancer tissue. Thousands of protein, lipid and glycan species exist in cells and tissues and their metabolism is monitored via numerous pathways, networks and methods. The metabolism can change in response to cellular environment alterations, such as development of a disease. Measuring such alterations and understanding the pathways involved are crucial to fully understand cellular metabolism in cancer development. In this paper Raman markers of glycogen, glycosaminoglycan, chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate proteoglycan were identified based on their vibrational signatures. High spatial resolution of Raman imaging combined with chemometrics allows separation of individual species from many chemical components present in each cell. We have found that metabolism of proteins, lipids and glycans is markedly deregulated in breast (adenocarcinoma) and brain (medulloblastoma) tumors. We have identified two glycoforms in the normal breast tissue and the malignant brain tissue in contrast to the breast cancer tissue where only one glycoform has been identified. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate anti-cancer effects of NLC-Citral in MDA MB-231 cells in vitro through the Annexin V, cell cycle, JC-1 and fluorometric assays. Additionally, this study is aimed to effects of NLC-Citral in reducing the tumor weight and size in 4T1 induced murine breast cancer model. Results showed that NLC-Citral induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest in MDA MB-231 cells. Furthermore, a prominent anti-metastatic ability of NLC-Citral was demonstrated in vitro using scratch, migration and invasion assays. A significant reduction of migrated and invaded cells was observed in the NLC-Citral treated MDA MB-231 cells. To further evaluate the apoptotic and anti-metastatic mechanism of NLC-Citral at the molecular level, microarray-based gene expression and proteomic profiling were conducted. Based on the result obtained, NLC-Citral was found to regulate several important signaling pathways related to cancer development such as apoptosis, cell cycle, and metastasis signaling pathways. Additionally, gene expression analysis was validated through the targeted RNA sequencing and real-time polymerase chain reaction. In conclusion, the NLC-Citral inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells in vitro, majorly through the induction of apoptosis, anti-metastasis, anti-angiogenesis potentials, and reducing the tumor weight and size without altering the therapeutic effects of citral. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The incidence of developing cancer should increase with the body mass, yet is not the case, a conundrum referred to as Peto’s paradox. Elephants have a lower incidence of cancer suggesting that these animals have probably evolved different ways to protect themselves against the disease. The paradox is worth revisiting with the realization that most mammals encode an endogenous APOBEC3 cytidine deaminase capable of mutating single stranded DNA. Indeed, the mutagenic activity of some APOBEC3 enzymes has been shown to introduce somatic mutations into genomic DNA. These enzymes are now recognized as causal agent responsible for the accumulation of CG- > TA transitions and DNA breaks leading to chromosomal rearrangements in human cancer genomes. Here, we identified an elephant A3Z1 gene, related to human APOBEC3A and showed that it could efficiently deaminate cytidine, 5-methylcytidine and produce DNA breaks leading to massive apoptosis, similar to other mammalian APOBEC3A enzymes where body mass varies by up to four orders of magnitude. Consequently, it could be considered that eAZ1 might contribute to cancer in elephants in a manner similar to their proposed role in humans. If so, eAZ1 might be particularly well regulated to counter Peto’s paradox. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Despite recent improvements in treatment, ovarian cancer is still the leading cause of death from gynaecological malignancies. Today, marine mollusks are considered as natural source of new biologically and pharmacologically active compounds by scientists and the pharmaceutical industries. The aim of this study is to investigate the selective apoptotic effects of Turbo coronatus crude extract fractions on human epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells and mitochondria. The cells and mitochondria were isolated from cancerous and non-cancerous ovarian tissues and exposed to IC 50 concentration of F1 fraction for evaluation of mitochondrial and cellular parameters. Our results showed that F1 fraction of T. coronatus crude extract significantly induced toxic effects only in the cancerous ovarian mitochondria, including increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, mitochondrial swelling, and cytochrome c release.Flow-cytometry analysis demonstrated that F1 fraction of T. coronatus progressively induced apoptosis and necrosis only on EOC but not non-cancerous cells. We eventuallyconcluded that F1 fraction of T. coronatus crude extract selectively induces apoptosis in EOC through a ROS-mediated pathway. © 2017, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

        fabio:abstract     "Artemisinin is used as an antimalarial and anticancer agent with minimal toxic effects on the host body. Biotin-PEG-PCL polymers have been used for targeted drug delivery to cancer, as well as to improve the pharmacokinetics of the drug and reduce its effects. In this study, biotin-conjugated copolymers were fabricated with polymerization of the ring opening method and the properties of copolymer and nanoparticles were investigated using various techniques. The toxicity of artemisinin and its nanoparticles have been investigated on MCF-7 and normal HFF2 cells. The results showed that the encapsulation efficacy of artemisinin in nanoparticles was 45.5 ± 0.41%. The release profile of the drug indicates that the release is slow and controlled and is approximately pH dependent. The results of artemisinin cell culture on human breast cancer cells showed that biotin-PEG-PCL nanoparticles had an inhibitory effect on MCF-7 cells and had no toxic effects on HFF2 cells. Anticancer activity in vivo in the 4T1 breast cancer model showed that tumour volumes were decreased up 40 mm3 by ART-loaded micelles and 76 mm3 by free ART, compared to the control group (2150 mm). In vivo results showed that this formulation significantly increases the accumulation of substances in the tumours. Therefore, the molecular formulation of ART-based copolymers can be a desirable process for cancer treatment purposes. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group." ;

It has been estimated that there are about 2 billion people with a serological profile of HBV infection, and 360 million patients worldwide living with chronic HBV-associated liver disease, hence the need to find an efficient and precise diagnosis technique to drive a robust treatment for Hepatitis B virus cannot be over emphasized. The emergence of analytical device like biosensor which combines biological and physicochemical element to detect HBV in screened samples has been very helpful in providing a timely intervention to tame this virus.

        fabio:abstract    "n-Butylidenephthalide (BP) is a potential anti-cancer drug, which can be extracted from Angelica sinensis (Danggui). Previous reports have shown the effectiveness of BP in treating cancer diseases. However, BP has no targeting capacity towards specific cancer cells. To improve treatment efficiency and reduce the dose of BP used in cancer treatment, targeting-based approaches should be developed. In the present study, we used riboflavin-5′-phosphate (RFMP) immobilized iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4 MNPs) as carriers for BP to treat cancer cell lines derived from liver, prostate and breast. These model cancer cells overexpress riboflavin receptors on their cell membrane and are also sensitive to BP treatment. Thus, BP-binding free RFMP on MNPs can be used as probes to target these model cells, whereas BP can be readily released on target cancer cells. Cell viability was twofold lower by using Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs immobilized with BP than that achieved by using free-form BP at a similar amount. Moreover, BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs have no apparent harmful effects on non-target cells. In addition, we evaluated the level of cysteine-aspartic acid protease 3 (caspase 3) in the resultant cell lysate obtained after treatment by BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs to demonstrate that apoptosis is mainly involved in the growth inhibition of target cells. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

The aim of this national population-based retrospective study was to analyze the relationship between MetS and the incidence of laryngeal cancer. Patients with laryngeal cancer (ICD-10: C32) between 2009 and 2010 were retrospectively identified and tracked until 2015 using the Korean Health Insurance claims database. During the seven-year follow-up period, 5,322 subjects were newly diagnosed with larynx cancer. The mean age of people with laryngeal cancer was much higher than those without (63.29 vs. 47.7 years, p < 0.0001), and the incidence of larynx cancer in men was much higher than that in women (93.16% vs. 6.84%, p < 0.0001). Age, gender, smoking status, alcohol intake, and exercise-adjusted hazard ratios indicated that participants with MetS had a 1.13-fold higher hazard of having larynx cancer than those without MetS. The number of MetS components was a strong risk factor for laryngeal cancer with a higher risk estimate of this cancer in both ex- and current smokers as well as people who have never smoked. MetS was found to be an independent risk factor for the incidence of laryngeal cancer. In Korea, MetS and its components are significantly associated with the development of laryngeal cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

In this study, we demonstrated that FLOT2 expression levels were greatly upregulated in glioma tissues and cell lines, and the FLOT2 expression in glioma tissue was markedly associated with tumour stage and size. Overexpression of FLOT2 was correlated with poor prognosis of glioma patients. The functional assay revealed that silenced FLOT2 repressed the viability, migration, and invasion of glioma cells. And then, we detected the relationship between miR-449 and FLOT2. Luciferase reporter assay and Western blot results showed that miR-449 directly binding the 3′UTR sequence of FLOT2 and regulated FLOT2 expression in glioma cells. Finally, we detected the expression levels of miR-449 in glioma tissue and cell lines and found that miR-449 was significantly downregulated in glioma tissues and cell lines. In conclusion, we demonstrated that overexpression FLOT2 was associated with poor prognosis of glioma patients and involved in the progression of glioma, identifying a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for glioma progression. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group." ;

One of the consequences of chromosomal rearrangement is gene fusions in the cancer genome. We have previously identified a panel of fusion genes in aggressive prostate cancers. In this study, we showed that 6 of these fusion genes are present in 7 different types of human malignancies with variable frequencies. Among them, the CCNH-C5orf30 and TRMT11-GRIK2 gene fusions were found in breast cancer, colon cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, ovarian cancer and liver cancer, with frequencies ranging from 12.9% to 85%. In contrast, four other gene fusions (mTOR-TP53BP1, TMEM135-CCDC67, KDM4-AC011523.2 and LRRC59-FLJ60017) are less frequent. Both TRMT11-GRIK2 and CCNH-C5orf30 are also frequently present in lymph node metastatic cancer samples from the breast, colon and ovary. Thus, detecting these fusion transcripts may have significant biological and clinical implications in cancer patient management. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Quantifying the genetic correlation between cancers can provide important insights into the mechanisms driving cancer etiology. Using genome-wide association study summary statistics across six cancer types based on a total of 296,215 cases and 301,319 controls of European ancestry, here we estimate the pair-wise genetic correlations between breast, colorectal, head/neck, lung, ovary and prostate cancer, and between cancers and 38 other diseases. We observed statistically significant genetic correlations between lung and head/neck cancer (r g = 0.57, p = 4.6 × 10 −8 ), breast and ovarian cancer (r g = 0.24, p = 7 × 10 −5 ), breast and lung cancer (r g = 0.18, p =1.5 × 10 −6 ) and breast and colorectal cancer (r g = 0.15, p = 1.1 × 10 −4 ). We also found that multiple cancers are genetically correlated with non-cancer traits including smoking, psychiatric diseases and metabolic characteristics. Functional enrichment analysis revealed a significant excess contribution of conserved and regulatory regions to cancer heritability. Our comprehensive analysis of cross-cancer heritability suggests that solid tumors arising across tissues share in part a common germline genetic basis. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Purpose: Several previous studies have shown that oral bisphosphonates (BPs) are associated with the incidence of 13 specific cancers, including lung cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the findings are heterogeneous. Methods and results: Relevant studies published in databases such as PubMed, Embase database, and Cochrane library were systematically retrieved from inception to August 25th, 2018, regardless of language, by two investigators independently. Afterwards, the maximum adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted from the retrieved studies. Finally, 13 cohort studies involving 1,510,763 participants were enrolled into this meta-analysis. No significant relationship was found between oral BPs and the risk of all-cause cancer in osteoporosis (OP) patients among the entire population (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80–1.18; I 2 92.5%). Besides, oral BPs could remarkably reduce the incidence of breast cancer (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68–0.92; I 2 54%) and endometrial cancer (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64–0.96; I 2 0%) in postmenopausal OP females. In addition, oral BPs were also found to evidently reduce the incidence of upper gastrointestinal cancer in OP patients among the entire population (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54–0.98; I 2 36.1%). However, oral BPs may lead to increased risk of liver cancer in mixed genders (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.03–2.77; I 2 30.7%). Conclusions: Taken together, oral BPs do not increase the risk of incidence of all-cause cancer; instead, they can reduce the incidence of breast, endometrial, and upper gastrointestinal cancers among the postmenopausal OP females. Our analysis stratified by gender suggests that oral BPs may increase the incidence of liver cancer in mixed genders, while no significant association was observed in females. Careful analysis of post-marketing data should be conducted to address the clinical relevance of our results on the putative association of oral BP use and liver cancer suggested by our meta-analysis. © 2018, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play critical roles in the tumor progression. However, it remains unclear how cancer cells migrate in the three-dimensional (3D) matrix of cancer tissues and how CAFs support the cancer invasion. Here we propose a novel mechanism of fibroblast-dependent cancer cell invasion in the 3D collagen matrix. Human cancer cell lines from the pancreas (Panc-1), lung (A549) and some other organs actively adhered to normal fibroblasts and primary lung CAFs in cultures. To show its significance in tumor invasion, we designed a new invasion assay in which homogeneous microspheroids consisting of cancer cells and fibroblasts were embedded into collagen gel. Time-lapse experiments showed that cancer cells adhered to and quickly migrated on the long protrusions of fibroblasts in the 3D collagen matrix. Fibroblast-free cancer cells poorly invaded the matrix. Experiments with function-blocking antibodies, siRNAs, and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that cancer cells adhered to fibroblasts through integrin α5β1-mediated binding to fibronectin on the surface of fibroblasts. Immunochemical analyses of the co-cultures and lung cancers suggested that cancer cells could acquire the migratory force by the fibronectin/integrin signaling. Our results also revealed that the fibroblast-bound fibronectin was a preferential substrate for cancer cells to migrate in the collagen matrix. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The prognosis of pancreatic cancer remains dismal despite continuous and considerable efforts. Integrins (ITGs) are highly expressed in various malignant cancers. However, very few studies investigated the role of integrin α3 (ITGα3) in malignant cancers. Here, we determined the functional role of ITGα3 in pancreatic cancer. Analysis of public microarray databases and Western blot analysis indicated a unique expression of ITGα3 in human pancreatic cancer. Silencing ITGα3 expression significantly inhibited the viability and migration of human pancreatic cancer cells. Notably, ablation of ITGα3 expression resulted in a significant decrease of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression compared with transfection of control-siRNA through an increased number of leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domain protein 1 (LRIG1) expression. In addition, ablating ITGα3 inhibited tumour growth via blockade of EGFR signalling in vivo. Furthermore, the highly expressed ITGα3 led to a poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. Our results provide novel insights into ITGα3-induced aggressive pancreatic cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Breast cancer metastasis accounts for most of the deaths from breast cancer. Since epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in promoting metastasis of cancer, many mechanisms regarding EMT have been studied. We previously showed that Ribonucleic acid export 1 (RAE1) is dysregulated in breast cancer and its overexpression leads to aggressive breast cancer phenotypes by inducing EMT. Here, we evaluated the functional capacity of RAE1 in breast cancer metastasis by using a three-dimensional (3D) culture system and xenograft models. Furthermore, to investigate the mechanisms of RAE1-driven EMT, in vitro studies were carried out. The induction of EMT with RAE1-overexpression was confirmed under the 3D culture system and in vivo system. Importantly, RAE1 mediates upregulation of an EMT marker ZEB1, by binding to the promoter region of ZEB1. Knockdown of ZEB1 in RAE1-overexpressing cells suppressed invasive and migratory behaviors, accompanied by an increase in epithelial and a decrease in mesenchymal markers. Taken together, these data demonstrate that RAE1 contributes to breast cancer metastasis by regulating a key EMT-inducing factor ZEB1 expression, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Obesity is a risk factor for many cancers including breast, esophageal, colon, and thyroid cancer. We aimed to evaluate the association of thyroid cancer with body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and weight change. This nationwide population-based cohort study included 11,323,006 adults who joined the national health screening program. Weight change was defined as the difference between the weight of the subjects measured during the study period and the weight at the time of four years ago. For evaluating the association between the weight change and the risk of thyroid cancer, subjects without weight change for four years were defined as the reference group. Mean age was 50.1 ± 13.7 years and 44% were female. In total, 50,464 subjects (0.4%) had newly-diagnosed thyroid cancer. After multivariable analyses, the incidence of thyroid cancer increased significantly in subjects with larger WC as well as higher BMI (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). In subjects who were lean and became obese, the incidence of thyroid cancers increased significantly (hazard ratio [HR] 1.15 [1.11–1.19]). In subjects who were obese and became lean, the incidence of thyroid cancers decreased significantly (HR 0.89 [0.86–0.93]). These results demonstrated that higher BMI and larger WC were significantly associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer. Weight gain in lean subjects was associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer, and weight reduction in subjects with obesity was associated with a decreased risk of thyroid cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) has increased among Norwegian women, and is among the highest in the world. In order to understand this increase, country specific dietary exposures have been investigated. The aim of this study was to quantify the association between consumption of brown cheese, a common bread topping in Norway, and colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer in the prospective Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) Study. Data on brown cheese consumption and adjustment factors was available for 82 527 women. During a mean of 14.6 years of follow-up (1.2 million person-years), there were 1360 cases of colorectal cancer (907 colon; 453 rectal). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer sites. We modelled restricted cubic splines with 4 knots, to assess a possible non-linear relationship between brown cheese intake and the investigated cancer sites. In the age-adjusted model, consumption of more than 2 slices (>16 grams) of brown cheese per day was associated with 13% reduced risk of colon cancer (95% CI 4%-21%) compared to women who did not consume brown cheese. The multivariable-adjusted model, however, showed no association between brown cheese consumption and the risk of colorectal, colon, or rectal cancer (colorectal: HR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.76–1.13, p-trend 0.37; colon: HR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.65–1.06; p-trend = 0.10; rectal: HR = 1.16, 95% CI 0.84–1.1.61, p-trend = 0.41). In this large, prospective cohort study of women, consumption of brown cheese was suggestively protective against colon cancer. However, adjustment attenuated the inverse risk association. Brown cheese consumption was not associated with rectal cancer, or colorectal cancer overall. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Current cancer diagnosis utilizes histopathology, which requires tissue acquisition, extensive processing and, in most cases, relies on the qualitative morphological analysis of tissues and cells. Molecular biomarkers are only available for a few specific tumor subtypes. We discovered that the fluorescence polarization (Fpol) of Methylene Blue (MB) is significantly higher in cancer than in normal human breast tissues and cells. We confirmed that fluorescence polarization imaging did not affect the viability of the cells and yielded highly significant differences between cancer and normal cells using MB concentrations as low as 0.05 and 0.01 mg/ml. To explain this phenomenon we examined intracellular localization of MB and its fluorescence lifetime. We determined that higher fluorescence polarization of MB occurs due to its increased accumulation in mitochondria of cancer cells, as well as shorter fluorescence lifetime in cancer relative to normal cells. As quantitative MB Fpol imaging can be performed in vivo and in real time, it holds the potential to provide an accurate quantitative marker of cancer at the cellular level. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

However, the specific combinations of mutations responsible for the vast majority of cancers have not been identified. Current computational approaches focus on identifying driver genes and mutations. Although individually these mutations can increase the risk of cancer they do not result in cancer without additional mutations. We present a fundamentally different approach for identifying the cause of individual instances of cancer: we search for combinations of genes with carcinogenic mutations (multi-hit combinations) instead of individual driver genes or mutations. We developed an algorithm that identified a set of multi-hit combinations that differentiate between tumor and normal tissue samples with 91% sensitivity (95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 89–92%) and 93% specificity (95% CI = 91–94%) on average for seventeen cancer types. We then present an approach based on mutational profile that can be used to distinguish between driver and passenger mutations within these genes. These combinations, with experimental validation, can aid in better diagnosis, provide insights into the etiology of cancer, and provide a rational basis for designing targeted combination therapies. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

We developed a novel computational platform applying a multi-modal approach to filter out passengers and more robustly identify putative driver genes. The primary filter identifies enrichment of cancer mutations in CATH functional families (CATH-FunFams) – structurally and functionally coherent sets of evolutionary related domains. Using structural representatives from CATH-FunFams, we subsequently seek enrichment of mutations in 3D and show that these mutation clusters have a very significant tendency to lie close to known functional sites or conserved sites predicted using CATH-FunFams. Our third filter identifies enrichment of putative driver genes in functionally coherent protein network modules confirmed by literature analysis to be cancer associated. Our approach is complementary to other domain enrichment approaches exploiting Pfam families, but benefits from more functionally coherent groupings of domains. Using a set of mutations from 22 cancers we detect 151 putative cancer drivers, of which 79 are not listed in cancer resources and include recently validated cancer associated genes EPHA7, DCC netrin-1 receptor and zinc-finger protein ZNF479. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Collectively, 86.3% (63/73) of HAMPs have recurrent alterations in at least 1 cancer type and 16 HAMPs, including 9 understudied HAMPs, are identified as putative therapeutic targets across multiple cancer types. For example, the recurrent focal amplification of BRD9 is observed in 9 cancer types and genetic depletion of BRD9 inhibits tumor growth.

        fabio:abstract    "The current system for evaluating prostate cancer architecture is the Gleason grading system which divides the morphology of cancer into five distinct architectural patterns, labeled 1 to 5 in increasing levels of cancer aggressiveness, and generates a score by summing the labels of the two most dominant patterns. The Gleason score is currently the most powerful prognostic predictor of patient outcomes; however, it suffers from problems in reproducibility and consistency due to the high intra-observer and inter-observer variability amongst pathologists. In addition, the Gleason system lacks the granularity to address potentially prognostic architectural features beyond Gleason patterns. We evaluate prostate cancer for architectural subtypes using techniques from topological data analysis applied to prostate cancer glandular architecture. In this work we demonstrate the use of persistent homology to capture architectural features independently of Gleason patterns. Specifically, using persistent homology, we compute topological representations of purely graded prostate cancer histopathology images of Gleason patterns 3,4 and 5, and show that persistent homology is capable of clustering prostate cancer histology into architectural groups through a ranked persistence vector. Our results indicate the ability of persistent homology to cluster prostate cancer histopathology images into unique groups with dominant architectural patterns consistent with the continuum of Gleason patterns. In addition, of particular interest, is the sensitivity of persistent homology to identify specific sub-architectural groups within single Gleason patterns, suggesting that persistent homology could represent a robust quantification method for prostate cancer architecture with higher granularity than the existing semi-quantitative measures. The capability of these topological representations to segregate prostate cancer by architecture makes them an ideal candidate for use as inputs to future machine learning approaches with the intent of augmenting traditional approaches with topological features for improved diagnosis and prognosis. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Among 8,651,569 cancer patients, 13,311 committed suicide; the rate of suicide was 28.58/ 100,000-person years, and the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of suicide was 4.44 (95% CI, 4.33, 4.55). The predominant patients who committed suicide were male (83%) and white (92%). Cancers of the lung, head and neck, testes, bladder, and Hodgkin lymphoma had the highest SMRs (> 5-10) through the follow up period. Elderly, white, unmarried males with localized disease are at highest risk vs other cancer patients. Among those diagnosed at < 50 years of age, the plurality of suicides is from hematologic and testicular tumors; if > 50, from prostate, lung, and colorectal cancer patients. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

However, the specific combinations of mutations responsible for the vast majority of cancers have not been identified. Current computational approaches focus on identifying driver genes and mutations. Although individually these mutations can increase the risk of cancer they do not result in cancer without additional mutations. We present a fundamentally different approach for identifying the cause of individual instances of cancer: we search for combinations of genes with carcinogenic mutations (multi-hit combinations) instead of individual driver genes or mutations. We developed an algorithm that identified a set of multi-hit combinations that differentiate between tumor and normal tissue samples with 91% sensitivity (95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 89–92%) and 93% specificity (95% CI = 91–94%) on average for seventeen cancer types. We then present an approach based on mutational profile that can be used to distinguish between driver and passenger mutations within these genes. These combinations, with experimental validation, can aid in better diagnosis, provide insights into the etiology of cancer, and provide a rational basis for designing targeted combination therapies. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The UHRF1-DNMT1 axis plays a key role in DNA maintenance methylation in mammals. Accumulative studies demonstrate that UHRF1 is broadly overexpressed in cancers, which contributes to cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Interestingly, a proteasome-dependent downregulation of UHRF1 has been observed in pluripotent ground state mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) cultured in the presence of two kinase (MEK1/MEK2 and GSK3β) inhibitors (termed 2i), raising the question whether UHRF1 is similarly regulated in cancer cells. Here we present evidence that while addition of 2i broadly downregulates UHRF1 and DNMT1 in various cancer cells, distinct underlying mechanisms are involved. In contrast to mESCs, 2i-induced downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in cancer cells cannot be rescued by proteasome inhibitor and occurs primarily at the level of transcription. Furthermore, downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 by 2i is due to inhibition of MEK1/MEK2, but not GSK3β activity. Data mining reveals a marked co-expression of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in normal tissues as well as cancers. We provide evidence that multiple transcription factors including E2F1 and SP1 mediate the transcriptional activation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 by the activated MEK/ERK pathway. Together our study reveals distinct regulation of UHRF1/DNMT1 in mESCs and cancer cells and identifies activated MEK/ERK pathway as a driving force for coordinated and aberrant over-expression of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in cancers. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

When it is applied to cancer cells, solid stress hinders their proliferation rate and promotes cancer cell invasion and metastatic potential. However, the underlying mechanisms of how it is implicated in cancer metastasis is not yet fully understood. Here, we used two pancreatic cancer cell lines and an established in vitro system to study the effect of solid stress-induced signal transduction on pancreatic cancer cell migration as well as the mechanism involved. Our results show that the migratory ability of cells increases as a direct response to solid stress. We also found that Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) expression and secretion is strongly upregulated in pancreatic cancer cells in response to mechanical compression. Performing a phosphoprotein screening, we identified that solid stress activates the Akt/CREB1 pathway to transcriptionally regulate GDF15 expression, which eventually promotes pancreatic cancer cell migration. Our results suggest a novel solid stress signal transduction mechanism bringing GDF15 to the centre of pancreatic tumor biology and rendering it a potential target for future anti-metastatic therapeutic innovations. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a cancer treatment that make use of the cancer-specific accumulation of porphyrins. We have reported that mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mitROS) upregulate uptake transporter of porphyrins, heme carrier protein-1 (HCP-1). The accumulation of cancer-specific porphyrins was increased by mitROS production, thereby the cancer-specific PDT cytotoxicity was enhanced. Thus we investigated whether mitROS production by hyperthermia can enhanced the cytotoxicity of PDT or not. In this study, 1 h of hyperthermia at 42 °C increased the mitROS production, and both the accumulation of cancer-specific porphyrins and the PDT cytotoxicity increased. Moreover, the authors treated cells with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) to examine the effect of mitROS. NAC inhibited the increasing ROS production after hyperthermia to restrain the post-treatment increase of cancer-specific porphyrins accumulation. Moreover, the increase of ROS production in cancer cells after hyperthermia upregulated HCP-1 expression and downregulated ABCG2 expression. These regulation were inhibited by NAC. These results suggest that hyperthermia treatment increased mitROS production, which involved HpD accumulation and enhanced PDT effects in cancer cells. The mechanism of this phenomenon was most likely to be due to both the upregulation of HCP-1 and the downregulation of ABCG2 by mitROS. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

In this study, we assessed the relationship between breast cancer and cadaverine biosynthesis. Cadaverine treatment of Balb/c female mice (500 nmol/kg p.o. q.d.) grafted with 4T1 breast cancer cells ameliorated the disease (lower mass and infiltration of the primary tumor, fewer metastases, and lower grade tumors). Cadaverine treatment of breast cancer cell lines corresponding to its serum reference range (100–800 nM) reverted endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, inhibited cellular movement and invasion, moreover, rendered cells less stem cell-like through reducing mitochondrial oxidation. Trace amino acid receptors (TAARs), namely, TAAR1, TAAR8 and TAAR9 were instrumental in provoking the cadaverine-evoked effects. Early stage breast cancer patients, versus control women, had reduced abundance of the CadA and LdcC genes in fecal DNA, both responsible for bacterial cadaverine production. Moreover, we found low protein expression of E. coli LdcC in the feces of stage 1 breast cancer patients. In addition, higher expression of lysine decarboxylase resulted in a prolonged survival among early-stage breast cancer patients. Taken together, cadaverine production seems to be a regulator of early breast cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Exogenous overexpression of CBX6 inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation, and induced cell cycle arrest along with suppression of migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro. Microarray analyses revealed that CBX6 governs a complex gene expression program. Moreover, CBX6 induced significant downregulation of bone marrow stromal cell antigen-2 (BST2), a potential therapeutic target, via interactions with its promoter region.

        fabio:abstract    "MRI plays important roles in endometrial and cervical cancer assessment, from detection to recurrent disease evaluation. Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common malignant tumor of the female genital tract in Western countries. EC patients are divided into risk categories based on histopathological tumor type, grade, and myometrial invasion depth. EC is surgically staged using the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) system. Since FIGO (2009) stage correlates with prognosis, preoperative staging is essential for tailored treatment. MRI reveals myometrial invasion depth, which correlates with tumor grade and lymph node metastases, and thus correlates with prognosis. Cervical cancer (CC) is the second most common cancer, and the third leading cause of cancer-related death among females in developing countries. The FIGO Gynecologic Oncology Committee recently revised its CC staging guidelines, allowing staging based on imaging and pathological findings when available. The revised FIGO (2018) staging includes node involvement and thus enables both therapy selection and evaluation, prognosis estimation, and calculation of end results. MRI can accurately assess prognostic indicators, e.g., tumor size, parametrial invasion, pelvic sidewall, and lymph node invasion. Despite these important roles of MRI, radiologists still face challenges due to the technical and interpretation pitfalls of MRI during all phases of endometrial and cervical cancer evaluation. Awareness of mimics that can simulate both cancers is critical. With careful application, functional MRI with DWI and DCE sequences can help establish a correct diagnosis, although it is sometimes necessary to perform biopsy and histopathological analysis. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Our observations were confirmed in a large variety of solid and haematological malignancies. This test was able to detect dysplasia and carcinomas in situ lesions in different organs and circulating factors in cancer patients years after the removal of their lesions. To our knowledge, this ability is unique and not shared by other liquid biopsy platforms. Immunohistochemistry analysis of the xenotransplants revealed identical patterns of differentiation regardless of the cancer type, showing that differentiation through horizontal transfer might be dependent on the nature of the target cells rather than the type of cancer factors.

Various studies have shown the significance of identifying drug targets for cancer, although this process continues challenging in the field of anti-cancer drug designing. The primary purpose of this study is to design a novel approach to identify target genes for cancer. The sub-network of colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancers were constructed from human protein–protein interaction network. The potential genes were analyzed using hubs and centrality measures. For the identification of target genes, we retrieve those genes that had the highest score in both mutation rates and graph centrality. Moreover, gene deletion analysis revealed that MYC, TP53, and EGFR genes remained potential targets in colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancer respectively. Results suggest that combining network measures with mutation frequencies in cancer genes might assist in recognizing several potential drug targets. Future enhancement of this current approach is to combine these network properties with the biological insights from gene expression data, and their functions will provide a reliable method for rational drug designing. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature." ;

As extracellular matrix, glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) could bind its surface receptor adhesion molecule CD44 which is strongly expressed on breast cancer. We have previously reported a doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded HA-Lys-LA X-NPs (X-NP-DOX) NP delivery system for breast cancer treatment. In this study, we further investigated the antitumor effect of X-NP-DOX NP delivery system using low-dose DOX in both in vitro and in vivo systems. We demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX possessed the ability for inhibiting MCF-7 breast cancer cell growth, invasion, and migration, and inducing apoptosis in vitro. In in vivo experiments, injection of low-dose X-NP-DOX into tumor-bearing mouse resulted in significant reduction of tumor size. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining further revealed that low-dose X-NP-DOX induced higher percentage of apoptotic cells compared with free DOX or saline. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX inhibited Notch1 and Ras/MAPK pathways, decreased cancer stem cell population, and reduced tumorigenesis compared to free DOX in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Owing to its enhanced efficacy and higher targetability compared to free DOX, low-dose DOX delivered by NP system may be a promising novel strategy for breast cancer treatment." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Breast cancer survivors display altered inflammatory responses to immune challenges relative to cancer-naive controls likely due to previous cancer treatments, stress associated with cancer, and/or tumor physiology. Proper inflammatory responses are necessary for adaptive sickness behaviors (e.g., fatigue, anorexia, and fever) and neuroinflammatory pathways are also implicated in mental health disturbances (e.g., cognitive impairment, depression) suffered by cancer patients and survivors. Rodent cancer models indicate that tumors are sufficient to exacerbate neuroinflammatory responses after an immune challenge, however primary tumors are not usually present in cancer survivors, and the behavioral consequences of these brain changes remain understudied. Therefore, we tested the extent to which mammary tumor resection attenuates tumor-induced neuroinflammation and sickness behavior following an immune challenge (i.p. lipopolysaccharide [LPS] injection) in mice. Tnf-α, Il-1β, and Il-6 mRNA decreased in multiple brain regions of LPS-treated tumor-bearing mice relative to LPS-treated controls; tumor resection attenuated these effects in some cases (but not Tnf-α). Tumors also attenuated sickness behaviors (hypothermia and lethargy) compared to LPS-treated controls. Tumor resection reversed these behavioral consequences, although basal body temperature remained elevated, comparable to tumor-bearing mice. Thus, tumors significantly modulate neuroinflammatory pathways with functional consequences and tumor resection mitigates most, but not all, of these changes. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Although substantial advances have been obtained both in treatment and survival rates, there is still a need for new therapeutical approaches. Natural compounds are a realistic source of new bioactive compounds with anticancer activity. Among them, rosemary polyphenols have shown a vast antiproliferative capacity against colon cancer cells in vitro and in animal models. We have investigated the antitumor activity of a rosemary extract (RE) obtained by using supercritical fluid extraction through its capacity to inhibit various signatures of cancer progression and metastasis such as proliferation, migration, invasion and clonogenic survival. RE strongly inhibited proliferation, migration and colony formation of colon cancer cells regardless their phenotype. Treatment with RE led to a sharp increase of intracellular ROS that resulted in necrosis cell death. Nrf2 gene silencing increased RE cytotoxic effects, thus suggesting that this pathway was involved in cell survival. These in vitro results were in line with a reduction of tumor growth by oral administration of RE in a xenograft model of colon cancer cells using athymic nude mice. These findings indicate that targeting colon cancer cells by increasing intracellular ROS and decreasing cell survival mechanisms may suppose a therapeutic option in colon cancer through the combination of rosemary compounds and chemotherapeutic drugs. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Although cure rates are high for early stage disease, clinical outcomes for advanced, metastatic, or recurrent disease remain poor. To change this panorama, a deeper understanding of cervical cancer biology and novel study models are needed. Immortalized human cancer cell lines such as HeLa constitute crucial scientific tools, but there are few other cervical cancer cell lines available, limiting our understanding of a disease known for its molecular heterogeneity. This study aimed to establish novel cervical cancer cell lines derived from Brazilian patients. We successfully established one (HCB-514) out of 35 cervical tumors biopsied. We confirmed the phenotype of HCB-514 by verifying its’ epithelial and tumor origin through cytokeratins, EpCAM and p16 staining. It was also HPV-16 positive. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) showed relevant somatic mutations in several genes including BRCA2, TGFBR1 and IRX2. A copy number variation (CNV) analysis by nanostring and WES revealed amplification of genes mainly related to kinases proteins involved in proliferation, migration and cell differentiation, such as EGFR, PIK3CA, and MAPK7. Overexpression of EGFR was confirmed by phospho RTK-array and validated by western blot analysis. Furthermore, the HCB-514 cell line was sensitive to cisplatin. In summary, this novel Brazilian cervical cancer cell line exhibits relevant key molecular features and constitutes a new biological model for pre-clinical studies. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

To determine how cancer cells adapt to RS, we have monitored the expression of different components of the ATR-CHK1 pathway in primary tumor samples. We show that unlike upstream components of the pathway, the checkpoint mediators Claspin and Timeless are overexpressed in a coordinated manner. Remarkably, reducing the levels of Claspin and Timeless in HCT116 cells to pretumoral levels impeded fork progression without affecting checkpoint signaling. These data indicate that high level of Claspin and Timeless increase RS tolerance by protecting replication forks in cancer cells. Moreover, we report that primary fibroblasts adapt to oncogene-induced RS by spontaneously overexpressing Claspin and Timeless, independently of ATR signaling. Altogether, these data indicate that enhanced levels of Claspin and Timeless represent a gain of function that protects cancer cells from of oncogene-induced RS in a checkpoint-independent manner. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Curcumin, the active polyphenol from turmeric, helps to obstruct the growth of many types of cancers at various stages which include prostrate, melanoma, breast, brain tumor, pancreatic, leukemia, etc. The initiation and recurrence of cancer have been attributed to few mutated cells in bulk of tumor called as cancer stem cells which have the capacity of self-renewal and differentiation. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3B) is a multifunctional serine/threonine protein kinase, originally found in mammals, an important component of diverse signaling pathways, dysregulation of which leads to affect the cancer stem cell properties. The nutritional- and phytochemical-based dietary interventions may complement current chemotherapy to prevent recurrence and relapse of cancer. The objective of present study is to investigate the effect of retinoic acid and curcumin–retinoic acid conjugates against GSK-3B protein.

Endometrial cancers are associated with several critical gene mutations, including PIK3A, PTEN, and KRAS. Different gene mutations in endometrial cancer cells have varied responses to anticancer drugs and cancer therapies. The most frequently altered gene in endometrioid endometrial carcinoma tumors is PTEN. PTEN protein has lipid phosphatase and protein phosphatase activity, as well as other functions in the nucleus. Although the tumor-suppressive function of PTEN has mainly been attributed to its lipid phosphatase activity, a role for PTEN protein phosphatase activity in cell cycle regulation has also been suggested. Various tumor type-specific PTEN mutations are well documented. Here, nine endometrioid endometrial cancer cell lines with PIK3A, PTEN, and KRAS gene mutations were treated with docetaxel and radiation. One mutation with a docetaxel drug-resistant effect was a truncated form of PTEN. Among PTEN mutations in endometrial cancer cells, the Y68 frame shift mutation of PTEN constitutes a major mechanism of resistance to docetaxel treatment. The molecular mechanism involves truncation of the 403 amino acid PTEN protein at amino acid 68 by the Y68 frame shift, leading to the loss of PTEN protein phosphatase and lipid phosphatase activities. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

The present review comprehends the stimuli-responsive polymers and multi-responsiveness with respect to cancer therapy. It focuses on the exploitation of different stimuli like temperature, pH and enzymes responsiveness in a multi-stimuli setting. Nanogels and micelles being two of the most commonly used responsive polymeric carriers have also been discussed. The role of multiple stimuli delivery system is significant due to multiple changes happening in the near surroundings of cancer cells.

In contrast, antibodies to BLV were found in a very small percentage of healthy blood donors. There was no association between BLV DNA and other tumor prognostic biological markers such as hormonal receptors, HER2 oncoprotein, proliferation index, metastasis in sentinels lymph nodes, and tumor grade and size. Our findings suggest that BLV should be considered a potential predisposing factor to breast cancer in women. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Copy number loss of PIK3R1 (p85α) most commonly occurs in ovarian cancer among all cancer types. Here we report that ovarian cancer cells manifest a spectrum of tumorigenic phenotypes upon knockdown of PIK3R1. PIK3R1 loss activates AKT and p110-independent JAK2/STAT3 signaling through inducing changes in the phosphorylation of the docking protein Gab2, thereby relieving the negative inhibition on AKT and promoting the assembly of JAK2/STAT3 signalosome, respectively. Additional mechanisms leading to AKT activation include enhanced p110α kinase activity and a decrease in PTEN level. PIK3R1 loss renders ovarian cancer cells vulnerable to inhibition of AKT or JAK2/STAT3. The combination of AKT and STAT3 inhibitors significantly increases the anti-tumor effect compared to single-agent treatments. Together, our findings provide a rationale for mechanism-based therapeutic approach that targets tumors with loss of PIK3R1. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we perform Repli-Seq and integrated epigenome analyses and demonstrate that genomic regions that undergo long-range epigenetic deregulation in prostate cancer also show concordant differences in replication timing. A subset of altered replication timing domains are conserved across cancers from different tissue origins. Notably, late-replicating regions in cancer cells display a loss of DNA methylation, and a switch in heterochromatin features from H3K9me3-marked constitutive to H3K27me3-marked facultative heterochromatin. Finally, analysis of 214 prostate and 35 breast cancer genomes reveal that late-replicating regions are prone to cis and early-replication to trans chromosomal rearrangements. Together, our data suggests that the nature of chromosomal rearrangement in cancer is related to the spatial and temporal positioning and altered epigenetic states of early-replicating compared to late-replicating loci. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are promising therapies for haematological cancers. Historically, their therapeutic benefit is due to ADC targeting of lineage-restricted antigens. The C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is attractive for targeted therapy of haematological cancers, given its expression in multiple tumour types and role in cancer “homing” to bone marrow. However, CXCR4 is also expressed in haematopoietic cells and other normal tissues, raising safety challenges to the development of anti-CXCR4 ADCs for cancer treatment. Here, we designed the first anti-CXCR4 ADC with favourable therapeutic index, effective in xenografts of haematopoietic cancers resistant to standard of care and anti-CXCR4 antibodies. We screened multiple ADC configurations, by varying type of linker-payload, drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR), affinity and Fc format. The optimal ADC bears a non-cleavable linker, auristatin as payload at DAR = 4 and a low affinity antibody with effector–reduced Fc. Contrary to other drugs targeting CXCR4, anti-CXCR4 ADCs effectively eliminated cancer cells as monotherapy, while minimizing leucocytosis. The optimal ADC selectively eliminated CXCR4 + cancer cells in solid tumours, but showed limited toxicity to normal CXCR4 + tissues, sparing haematopoietic stem cells and progenitors. Our work provides proof-of-concept that through empirical ADC design, it is possible to target proteins with broad normal tissue expression. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Cancers in the bone produce a number of severe symptoms including pain that compromises patient functional status, quality of life, and survival. The source of this pain is multifaceted and includes factors secreted from tumor cells. Malignant cells release the neurotransmitter and cell-signaling molecule glutamate via the oxidative stress-related cystine/glutamate antiporter, system x C − , which reciprocally imports cystine for synthesis of glutathione and the cystine/cysteine redox cycle. Pharmacological inhibition of system x C − has shown success in reducing and delaying the onset of cancer pain-related behavior in mouse models. This investigation describes the development of a stable siRNA-induced knockdown of the functional trans-membrane system x C − subunit xCT (SLC7A11) in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Clones were verified for xCT knockdown at the transcript, protein, and functional levels. RNAseq was performed on a representative clone to comprehensively examine the transcriptional cellular signature in response to xCT knockdown, identifying multiple differentially regulated factors relevant to cancer pain including nerve growth factor, interleukin-1, and colony-stimulating factor-1. Mice were inoculated intrafemorally and recordings of pain-related behaviors including weight bearing, mechanical withdrawal, and limb use were performed. Animals implanted with xCT knockdown cancer cells displayed a delay until the onset of nociceptive behaviors relative to control cells. These results add to the body of evidence suggesting that a reduction in glutamate release from cancers in bone by inhibition of the system x C − transporter may decrease the severe and intractable pain associated with bone metastases. © The Author(s) 2019." ;

Method: For finding the related articles, the researchers searched several databases including PubMed &ProQuest and valid websites including ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Scientific Information Database, and Magiran. The key terms of \"reflexology, cancer, and chemotherapy\" individually and combined together were searched in Parisian and English, and the studies performed from 2009 to 2018 were extracted. Due to the lack of sufficient studies carried out into the outcome of reflexology on chemotherapy, both Persian and English articles were used. Results: A total of 57 studies were extracted from the databases and valid websites; five of which met the inclusion criteria. All selected studies were clinical trials. Implications for Practice: Reflexology can be used as a non-pharmacologic nursing intervention to alleviate the side effects of chemotherapy and improve the quality of life of cancer patients. © 2019 Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

For effective evaluation of this strategy it is crucial to identify which patients are suited for CD47-targeted therapy. In this respect, expression of the pro-phagocytic signal SLAMF7 on both macrophages and cancer cells was recently reported to be a requisite for CD47 antibody-mediated phagocytosis. Here, we demonstrate that in fact SLAMF7 expression on cancer cells is not required and does not impact on CD47 antibody therapy. Moreover, SLAMF7 also does not impact on phagocytosis induction by CD20 antibody rituximab nor associates with overall survival of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma patients. In contrast, expression of CD47 negatively impacts on overall and progression free survival. In conclusion, cancer cell expression of SLAMF7 is not required for phagocytosis and, in contrast to CD47 expression, should not be used as selection criterion for CD47-targeted therapy. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Increased Crabp2 levels have been found in various types of cancer, and are associated with poor patients’ survival. Although Crabp2 is found to be overexpressed in lung cancer, its role in metastasis of lung cancer is unclear. In this study, Crabp2 was overexpressed in high-metastatic C10F4 than low-metastatic lung cancer cells. Analysis of clinical samples revealed that high CRABP2 levels were correlated with lymph node metastases, poor overall survival, and increased recurrence. Knockdown of Crabp2 decreased migration, invasion, anoikis resistance, and in vivo metastasis. Crabp2 was co-immunoprecipitated with HuR, and overexpression of Crabp2 increased HuR levels, which promoted integrin β1/FAK/ERK signaling. Inhibition of HuR or integrin β1/FAK/ERK signaling reversed the promoting effect of Crabp2 in migration, invasion, and anoikis resistance. Knockdown of Crabp2 further inhibited the growth of cancer cells as compared with that by gemcitabine or irinotecan alone. The expression of Crabp2 in human lung tumors was correlated with stress marker CHOP. In conclusion, our findings have identified the promoting role of Crabp2 in anoikis resistance and metastasis. CRABP2 may serve as a prognostic marker and targeting CRABP2 may be exploited as a modality to reduce metastasis. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "SPG-56 is a newly isolated glycoprotein from sweet potatoes (Zhongshu NO. 1), but its value for suppressing breast cancer progression remains unknown. This study was designed to investigate the potential anti-cancer effects of SPG-56, which consists of 2.9% sugar and 97.1% protein. The effects of SPG-56 on the proliferation and apoptosis of breast cancer cells were determined using CCK-8 and Hoechst 33342 assays and flow cytometry, after staining with Annexin V and PI respectively. The activities of SPG-56 against breast cancer were examined using female BALB/c nude mice orthotopically implanted with human breast carcinoma cells of the types MCF-7 and 4T1-Luc. The cellular experiments showed that SPG-56 inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of MCF-7 cells dose- and time-dependently. Oral administration of SPG-56 significantly suppressed the development of MCF-7 tumor cells (P < 0.01) as compared with an untreated group. The serum tumor markers CEA, CA125 and CA153 in a 240 mg/kg/d SPG-56 decreased by 54.8%, 91.8%, and 90.3%, respectively. The experiments further demonstrated that SPG-56 inhibited the metastasis of breast cancer in MCF-7 and 4T1-bearing mice by altering the expression of MMP2, MMP9, VEGF, Occludin and Claudin. It is concluded that SPG-56 may have potential as a novel anti-tumor candidate for breast cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Lymph node metastasis is of major prognostic significance for breast cancer. Lymph node metastasis arises at a very early stage in some patients. Using the data downloaded from the TCGA database, we studied the differences between primary tumors with and without lymph node metastasis at the multi-omics level using bioinformatics approaches. Our study found that low mutation and neoantigen burdens correlated with lymph node metastazation of breast cancer. All three conserved domains in TP53 were mutated in lymph node-negative breast cancers, whereas only one domain was mutated in lymph node-positive samples. Mutations in microtubule-related proteins appear to help immune cells recognize tumors and inhibit their lymph node metastasis. Destroying microtubule-related proteins is a potential therapeutic strategy to inhibit lymph node metastasis of breast cancer. As the neoantigens specifically present in lymph node-positive breast cancers, MAPK10, BC9L, TRIM65, CD93, KITLG, CNPPD1, CPED1, CCDC146, TMEM185A, INO80D, and PSMD11 are potential targets for vaccine design. In the tumor microenvironment, reduced numbers of effector immune cells, especially activated memory CD4+ T cells and activated mast cells, facilitate breast cancer metastasis to the lymph nodes. According to transcriptome data, lymph node metastasis was mostly driven by gene mutation rather than by gene expression. Although differential gene expression analysis was based on lymph node metastasis status, many genes were shown to be differentially expressed based on estrogen receptor status. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Fibroblasts turn into cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumour microenvironment. CAFs have recently attracted attention for their function as a regulator of immune cell recruitment and function in addition to their tumour-promoting roles. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of CAFs on monocyte recruitment and macrophage polarization in breast cancer. CAFs, which were α-SMA expressing fibroblasts in contrast to normal fibroblasts (NFs), effectively recruited monocytes. Recruitment of monocytes by CAFs might be mediated by monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) as well as stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) cytokines. CAFs differentiated the recruited monocytes into M2-like macrophages which are capable of exerting their immunosuppressive roles via the PD-1 axis. CAF-educated monocytes exhibited strong immune suppression unlike NF-educated monocytes and enhanced the motility/invasion of breast cancer cells in addition to increasing the expressions of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes and vimentin protein in cancer cells. CAF-educated M1 macrophages displayed increased expression of M2 markers and production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in contrast to decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12 compared with control M1 macrophages; suggesting that CAFs were also able to induce the trans-differentiation of M1 macrophages to M2 macrophages. We then investigated the relationship between the infiltration of CAFs and tumour associated macrophages (TAMs) using tissue samples obtained from breast cancer patients. High grade of CAFs significantly correlated with the number of TAMs in human breast cancer tissue samples. It was also associated with higher Ki-67 proliferation index, and higher tumour volume. This result is in line with our finding of increased breast cancer cell proliferation due to the effects of CAF-educated monocytes in vitro. Our results concluded that CAFs play pivotal roles in sculpturing the tumour microenvironment in breast cancer, and therapeutic strategies to reverse the CAF-mediated immunosuppressive microenvironment should be taken into consideration. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

We construct iCells of four cancers and the corresponding tissue controls and identify the most rewired genes in cancer. Many of them are of unknown function and cannot be identified as different in cancer in any specific molecular network. We biologically validate that they have a role in cancer by knockdown experiments followed by cell viability assays. We find additional support through Kaplan-Meier survival curves of thousands of patients. Finally, we extend this analysis to uncover pan-cancer genes.

The increasing popularity of sequencing technologies motivates the in-silico identification of CCLs based on their mutational fingerprint, but care must be taken when identifying heterogeneous data. We recently developed the proof-of-concept Uniquorn 1 method which could reliably identify heterogeneous sequencing data from selected sequencing technologies. Here we present Uniquorn 2, a generic and robust in-silico identification method for CCLs with DNA/RNA-seq and panel-seq information. We benchmarked Uniquorn 2 by cross-identifying 1612 RNA and 3596 panel-sized NGS profiles derived from 1516 CCLs, five repositories, four technologies and three major cancer panel-designs. Our method achieves an accuracy of 96% for RNA-seq and 95% for mixed DNA-seq and RNA-seq identification. Even for a panel of only 94 cancer-related genes, accuracy remains at 82% but decreases when using smaller panels.

In this ex vivo study of nine fresh human colon specimens, we report the first use of quantified subsurface scattering coefficient maps acquired by swept-source optical coherence tomography to reveal subsurface abnormities. We generate subsurface scattering coefficient maps with a novel wavelet-based-curve-fitting method that provides significantly improved accuracy. The angular spectra of scattering coefficient maps of normal tissues exhibit a spatial feature distinct from those of abnormal tissues. An angular spectrum index to quantify the differences between the normal and abnormal tissues is derived, and its strength in revealing subsurface cancer in ex vivo samples is statistically analyzed. The study demonstrates that the angular spectrum of the scattering coefficient map can effectively reveal subsurface colorectal cancer and potentially provide a fast and more accurate diagnosis. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Current options in palliation such as hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) present severe side effects. Recent research efforts suggested the therapeutic use of oxidant-enriched liquid using cold physical plasma. To investigate a clinically accepted treatment regimen, we assessed the antitumor capacity of plasma-treated saline solution. In response to such liquid, CT26 murine colon cancer cells were readily oxidized and showed cell growth with subsequent apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and upregulation of immunogenic cell death (ICD) markers in vitro. This was accompanied by marked morphological changes with re-arrangement of actin fibers and reduced motility. Induction of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype was not observed. Key results were confirmed in MC38 colon and PDA6606 pancreatic cancer cells. Compared to plasma-treated saline, hydrogen peroxide was inferiorly toxic in 3D tumor spheroids but of similar efficacy in 2D models. In vivo, plasma-treated saline decreased tumor burden in Balb/C mice. This was concomitant with elevated numbers of intratumoral macrophages and increased T cell activation following incubation with CT26 cells ex vivo. Being a potential adjuvant for HIPEC therapy, our results suggest oxidizing saline solutions to inactivate colon cancer cells while potentially stimulating antitumor immune responses. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Although solid fuel combustion emissions are known to increase the prevalence of illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer, however, their effect on the eyes is underexplored. This study assesses the acute toxicity of solid fuel combustion emissions on healthy ocular cells and a cancer cell line. Three healthy ocular cell lines (corneal, lens, and retinal epithelial cells) and a cancer cell line (Chinese hamster ovary cells) were exposed to liquid and gas phase emissions from applewood and coal combustion. Following the exposure, real-time cell attachment behavior was monitored for at least 120 hours with electrical cell impedance spectroscopy. The viability of the cells, amount of apoptotic cells, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were quantified with MTT, ApoTox-Glo, and ROS-Glo H 2 O 2 assays, respectively. The results showed that coal emissions compromised the viability of ocular cells more than applewood emissions. Interestingly, the cancer cells, although their viability was not compromised, generated 1.7 to 2.7 times more ROS than healthy cells. This acute exposure study provides compelling proof that biomass combustion emissions compromise the viability of ocular cells and increase ROS generation. The increased ROS generation was fatal for ocular cells, but it promoted the growth of cancer cells. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

The goal of this study was to classify mice with and without tumors and compare tumors localized to the mammary pad and tumor cells injected into the iliac artery by differences in VOCs in urine. After 4T1.2 tumor cells were injected into BALB/c mice either in the mammary pad or into the iliac artery, urine was collected, VOCs from urine headspace were concentrated by solid phase microextraction and results were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry quadrupole time-of-flight. Multivariate and univariate statistical analyses were employed to find potential biomarkers for breast cancer and metastatic breast cancer in mice models. A set of six VOCs classified mice with and without tumors with an area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC AUC) of 0.98 (95% confidence interval [0.85, 1.00]) via five-fold cross validation.

Moreover, the high drug loading capacity of Cet-SLN was employed to encapsulate photothermal agent indocyanine green (ICG) to finally fabricate a versatile drug delivery system (DDS) able to co-deliver Cet and ICG (Cet-SLN/ICG) for combinational chemo-photothermal therapy of breast cancer. The obtained results clearly demonstrated that Cet-SLN/ICG was well-dispersed nanoparticles with preferable stability under physiological condition. Furthermore, due to the conjugation of Cet, Cet-SLN/ICG could target EGFR which overexpress in MCF-7 cells. Most importantly, both in vitro and in vivo results suggested that compared with Cet or ICG alone, the Cet-SLN/ICG showed superior anticancer efficacy.

        fabio:abstract    "The integration of genomic and DNA methylation data has been demonstrated as a powerful strategy in understanding cancer mechanisms and identifying therapeutic targets. The TCGA consortium has mapped DNA methylation in thousands of cancer samples using Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 K BeadChip (Illumina 450 K array) that only covers about 1.5% of CpGs in the human genome. Therefore, increasing the coverage of the DNA methylome would significantly leverage the usage of the TCGA data. Here, we present a new model called EAGLING that can expand the Illumina 450 K array data 18 times to cover about 30% of the CpGs in the human genome. We applied it to analyze 13 cancers in TCGA. By integrating the expanded methylation, gene expression, and somatic mutation data, we identified the genes showing differential patterns in each of the 13 cancers. Many of the triple-evidenced genes identified in majority of the cancers are biomarkers or potential biomarkers. Pan-cancer analysis also revealed the pathways in which the triple-evidenced genes are enriched, which include well known ones as well as new ones, such as axonal guidance signaling pathway and pathways related to inflammatory processing or inflammation response. Triple-evidenced genes, particularly TNXB, RRM2, CELSR3, SLC16A3, FANCI, MMP9, MMP11, SIK1, and TRIM59 showed superior predictive power in both tumor diagnosis and prognosis. These results have demonstrated that the integrative analysis using the expanded methylation data is powerful in identifying critical genes/pathways that may serve as new therapeutic targets. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "A key challenge facing immunotherapy is poor infiltration of T cells into tumors, along with suppression of cells reaching these sites. However, macrophages make up a majority of immune cell infiltrates into tumors, creating natural targets for immunotherapies able to direct macrophages away from tumor-supportive functions and toward anti-tumor phenotypes. Recent studies demonstrate that toll-like receptors (TLRs) – pathways that quickly trigger early immune responses – play an important role in polarizing macrophages. Here, we present emerging ways in which TLR signaling is being manipulated in macrophages to create new opportunities for cancer immunotherapy. In particular, we discuss approaches to deliver TLR agonists, to leverage biomaterials in these therapies, and to couple TLR-based approaches with other frontline treatments as combination cancer therapies. © 2019" ;

However, immune checkpoint inhibitors are only advantageous for a limited population of cancer patients. Therefore, companion diagnostics are needed in order to identify patients for whom these therapies are effective. In the present study, we evaluated detailed immunological aspects in clinical specimens from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. We analyzed the immune profiles, T cell cytotoxicity, and TCR repertoire of peripheral blood, normal lung tissue, and tumor tissue from NSCLC patients. By using bispecific T-cell engager technology to assess the cytotoxicity of T cells, we found that the cytotoxicity of tumor-infiltrated T cells closely correlated with that of peripheral T cells. This correlation was supported by the immune profiles, cytokine production, and results of the TCR repertoire analysis from these specimens. We also found that the cytotoxicity of peripheral T cells has potential as a predictor of the effects of nivolumab in the tumor microenvironment. These results imply further applications to blood-based immune monitoring systems and predictive biomarkers for cancer immunotherapy. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

This standard procedure relies on the slow radioactivity loss, usually attributed to the limited tumour expression of G6P-phosphatase (G6Pase). However, this classical interpretation intrinsically represents an approximation since, as in all tissues, cancer G6Pase activity is remarkable and is confined to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whose lumen must be reached by phosphorylated FDG to explain its hydrolysis and radioactivity release. The present study tested the impact of G6Pase sequestration on the mathematical description of FDG trafficking and handling in cultured cancer cells. Our data show that accounting for tracer access to the ER configures this compartment as the preferential site of FDG accumulation. This is confirmed by the reticular localization of fluorescent FDG analogues. Remarkably enough, reticular accumulation rate of FDG is dependent upon extracellular glucose availability, thus configuring the same ER as a significant determinant of cancer glucose metabolism. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Although current methods of treatment for cervical cancer can ablate lesions, preventing metastatic disseminations and excessive tissue injuries still remains a major concern. Hence, development of a safer and more efficient treatment modality is of vital importance. Natural products from plants are one of the principal sources of precursors to lead compounds with direct pharmaceutical application across all disease classes. One of these plants is Ficus carica, whose fruit latex, when applied on HPV-induced skin warts, has shown potential as a possible cure for this virus related lesions. This study explores the in vitro biological activities of fig latex and elucidates its possible mechanisms of action on cervical cancer cell lines CaSki and HeLa positive for HPV type 16 and 18, respectively. Our data shows that fig latex inhibits properties that are associated with HPV-positive cervical cancer transformed cells such as rapid growth and invasion and substantially downregulated the expression of p16 and HPV onco-proteins E6, E7. These findings suggest Ficus carica latex has the potential to be used in the development of therapeutic modalities for the possible treatment, cure and prevention of HPV related cervical cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing methods, the diversity and composition of the microbiota from ovarian cancer tissues (25 samples) and normal distal fallopian tube tissues (25 samples) were analyzed. High-throughput sequencing showed that the diversity and richness indexes were significantly decreased in ovarian cancer tissues compared to tissues from normal distal fallopian tubes. The ratio of the two phyla for Proteobacteria/Firmicutes was notably increased in ovarian cancer, which revealed that microbial composition change might be associated with the process of ovarian cancer development. In addition, transcriptome-sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses suggested that the transcriptional profiles were statistically different between ovarian carcinoma and normal distal fallopian tubes. Moreover, a set of genes including 84 different inflammation-associated or immune-associated genes, which had been named as the human antibacterial-response genes were also modulated expression. Therefore, we hypothesize that the microbial composition change, as a novel risk factor, may be involving the initiation and progression of ovarian cancer via influencing and regulating the local immune microenvironment of fallopian tubes except for regular pathways. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Several pioneering work have established that apart from genetic alterations, epigenetic modifications contribute significantly in tumor progression. Remarkable role of EZH2 in cancer highlights the importance of identifying its targets. Although much emphasis has been placed in recent years in designing drugs and inhibitors targeting EZH2, less effort has been given in exploring its existing targets that will help in understanding the oncogenic role of EZH2 in turn which may provide a more stringent method of targeting EZH2. In the present study, we validated six direct targets of EZH2 that are GPNMB, PMEPA1, CoL5A1, VGLL4, POMT2 and SUMF1 associated with cancer related pathways. Upon EZH2 knockdown, more than two fold increase in the target gene expression was evident. CHIP-qPCR performed in both MCF-7 and MDA-MDA-231 confirmed the in-vivo binding of EZH2 on its identified target. Thirty invasive breast carcinoma cases with their adjacent normal tissues were included in the study. Immunohistochemistry in primary breast tumor tissue array showed tumor dependent expression of EZH2. Array of MERAV expression database revealed the strength of association of EZH2 with its target genes. Real time PCR performed with RNA extracted from breast tumor tissues further authenticated the existing negative correlation between EZH2 and its target genes. Pearson correlation coefficient & statistical significance computed using the matrix provided in the database strengthened the negative correlation between identified target genes and EZH2. KM plotter analysis showed improved relapse-free survival with increased expression of PMEPA1, POMT2, VGLL4 and SUMF1 in breast cancer patients indicating their therapeutic potential. While investigating the relevance of these target genes, different mutations of them were found in breast cancer patients. Seeking the clinical relevance of our study, following our recent publication that reports the role of EZH2 in nicotine-mediated breast cancer development and progression, we observed significant reduced expression of SUMF1 in breast cancer patient samples with smoking history in comparison to never-smoked patient samples. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we report that TOP1MT is overexpressed in cancer tissues and demonstrate that TOP1MT deficiency attenuates tumor growth in human and mouse models of colon and liver cancer. Due to their mitochondrial dysfunction, TOP1MT-KO cells become addicted to glycolysis, which limits synthetic building blocks and energy supply required for the proliferation of cancer cells in a nutrient-deprived tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, we show that TOP1MT associates with mitoribosomal subunits, ensuring optimal mitochondrial translation and assembly of oxidative phosphorylation complexes that are critical for sustaining tumor growth. The TOP1MT genomic signature profile, based on Top1mt-KO liver cancers, is correlated with enhanced survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients.

A new data integrative approach, based on graphical models, was applied on our multi-modal –omics, and clinical data cohort of metastatic melanoma patients. We found that response to chemotherapy is directly linked to ten gene expression, four methylation variables and PARP1 SNP rs1805407. PARP1 is a DNA repair gene critical for chemotherapy response and for which FDA-approved inhibitors are clinically available (olaparib). We demonstrated that two PARP inhibitors (ABT-888 and olaparib) make SNP carrier cancer cells of various histologic subtypes more sensitive to alkylating agents, but they have no effect in wild-type cells. Furthermore, PARP1 inhibitors act synergistically with chemotherapy in SNP carrier cells (especially in ovarian cancer for which olaparib is FDA-approved), but they are additive at best in wild-type cancer cells. Taken together, our results suggest that the combination of chemotherapy and PARP1 inhibition may benefit the carriers of rs1805407 in the future and may be used in personalized therapy strategies to select patients that are more likely to respond to PARP inhibitors. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Earlier studies have shown that bovine α -lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells (BAMLET) becomes cytotoxic against cancer cells in complex with oleic acid {Hoque, M. et. al., PLoSOne8, e68390 (2013)}. In our study, we obtained bovine α-lactalbumin complexed with lanthanum ion (La 3+ -B-α-LA) and determined its high resolution crystal structure. The natural calcium binding site of bovine α-lactalbumin is replaced by lanthanum. The La 3+ complex formation by B-α-apo-LA was also supported by various biophysical methods. Interestingly, our complex, La 3+ -B-α-LA exhibits much greater anticancer activity against breast cancer cells as compared to the reported BAMLET-oleic acid complex. This study shows that La 3+ -B-α-LA complex is preferentially more toxic to MCF-7 cells as compared to KB (oral cancer) and HeLa (cervical) cells, while almost non-toxic to the healthy cells that we studied. Our data indicates that the cytotoxicity of La 3+ -B-α-LA against cancer cells is through apoptotic path way. The higher anticancer activity of La 3+ -B-α-LA is attributable to the requisite structural changes induced in the protein by La 3+ binding as supported by the crystal structure of the complex. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

However, no studies have evaluated vascular pain in patients with colorectal cancer in relation to peripheral venous administration of chemotherapy with or without oxaliplatin. We evaluated oxaliplatin-induced vascular pain using subjective and objective methods. We determined if oxaliplatin induced vascular pain in patients with colorectal cancer using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and a PainVision PS-2100 device. We compared VAS score between chemotherapy regimens with or without oxaliplatin, and between genders. We also examined the correlations of VAS score with pain intensity examined by the PainVision PS-2100, and with age and vessel diameter. A total of 98 patients with colorectal cancer were enrolled in this study, including 78 patients who received oxaliplatin via peripheral venous administration and 20 who received chemotherapy without oxaliplatin. The median VAS scores in patients with and without oxaliplatin were 36.5 (interquartile range 9.0–60.0) and 0 (0–4.0), respectively (P < 0.001), and the median pain intensities according to PainVision were 43.5 (14.3–98) and 36.5 (9.3–58.5), respectively (P < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between VAS and pain intensity (r = 0.584), but no correlation between VAS score and age (r = −0.174) or vessel diameter (r = −0.107). Peripheral venous administration of oxaliplatin induced vascular pain, measured both subjectively and objectively, in patients with colorectal cancer, regardless of vessel diameter. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Primary bronchial cancer accounts for almost 20% of all cancer death worldwide. One of the emerging techniques with tremendous power for lung cancer therapy is magnetic aerosol drug targeting (MADT). The use of a permanent magnet for effective drug delivery in a desired location throughout the lung requires extensive optimization, but it has not been addressed yet. In the present study, the possibility of using a permanent magnet for trapping the particles on a lung tumor is evaluated numerically in the Weibel's model from G0 to G3. The effect of different parameters is considered on the efficiency of particle deposition in a tumor located on a distant position of the lung bronchi and bronchioles. Also, the effective position of the magnetic source, tumor size, and location are the objectives for particle deposition. The results show that a limited particle deposition occurs on the lung branches in passive targeting. However, the incorporation of a permanent magnet next to the tumor enhanced the particle deposition fraction on G2 to up to 49% for the particles of 7 µm diameter. Optimizing the magnet size could also improve the particle deposition fraction by 68%. It was also shown that the utilization of MADT is essential for effective drug delivery to the tumors located on the lower wall of airway branches given the dominance of the air velocity and resultant drag force in this region. The results demonstrated the high competence and necessity of MADT as a noninvasive drug delivery method for lung cancer therapy." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. Adjuvant chemotherapy has significantly reduced mortality but increased cognitive impairments, including attention function, making quality of life issues a crucial concern. This study enrolled nineteen breast cancer patients who were treated with standard chemotherapy within 6 months and 20 sex-matched healthy controls to investigate the brain effects of chemotherapy. All participants underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) with mean fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (mfALFF) analysis and were correlated with neuropsychological tests, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised (CAMS-R), and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), to explore the possible underlying mechanism of cognitive alternations. We found increased mfALFF over the frontoparietal lobe and decreased mfALFF over the occipital lobe in the cancer patients compared with the healthy controls; the altered brain regions may be associated with the dorsal attention network (DAN) and may be explained by a compensatory mechanism. Both MMSE and CAMS-R scores showed a positive correlation with mfALFF in the occipital lobe but a negative correlation in the frontoparietal lobe. By contrast, IES-R scores showed a positive correlation with mfALFF in the frontoparietal lobe but a negative correlation in the occipital lobe. These alterations are potentially related to the effects of both chemotherapy and psychological distress. Future research involving a larger sample size of patients with breast cancer is recommended. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

In the case of mutations in individual genes that cause them to be incorrectly spliced, engineered splicing factors can be introduced to correct splicing of these aberrant transcripts and reduce the effects of the disease phenotype. Mutations that occur in certain splicing factor genes themselves have been implicated in many cancers, particularly myelodysplastic syndromes. Small molecules that target splicing factors have been developed as therapies to preferentially induce apoptosis in these cancer cells. Specifically, drugs targeting the splicing factor SF3B1 have led to recent clinical trials.

Analysis of AA-reconstructed amplicons in a pan-cancer dataset reveals many novel properties of copy number amplifications in cancer. These findings support a model in which focal amplifications arise due to the formation and replication of extrachromosomal DNA. Applying AA to 68 viral-mediated cancer samples, we identify a large fraction of amplicons with specific structural signatures suggestive of hybrid, human-viral extrachromosomal DNA.

There have been many attempts to identify markers and key pathways induced throughout EMT but the process is complex and depends on the cancer type and tumour microenvironment. Here we used the colon cancer cell line HT29, which stably overexpressed Snail, the key transcription factor in early EMT, as a model for colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with a pro-metastatic phenotype. We investigated miRNA expression regulation during that phenotypic switching. We found that overexpression of Snail in HT29 cells triggered significant changes in individual miRNA levels but did not change the global efficiency of miRNA processing. Snail abundance repressed the expression of miR-192 and miR-194 and increased miR-205, let-7i and SNORD13 levels. These identified changes correlated with the reported transcriptomic alterations in Snail-overexpressing HT29 cells. We also investigated how Snail affected the miRNA content of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from HT29 cells. Our data suggest that the presence of Snail significantly alters the complex mRNA/miRNA interactions in the early steps of metastasis and also has an impact on the content of EVs released from HT29 cells. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

This retrospective case-control study compared patients who had lung cancer with PJP (n = 112) or without PJP (n = 336) matched according to age, sex, histopathology, and stage. PJP definition was based on (i) positive PCR or direct immunofluorescence results for pneumocystis, (ii) clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities that were consistent with a pneumonic process, and (iii) received targeted PJP treatment. The development of PJP was associated with radiotherapy (RTx), concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRTx), lymphopenia, and prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (20 mg of prednisolone equivalent per day for ≥3 weeks). Multivariate analysis revealed independent associations with prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06–3.63; p = 0.032) and CCRTx (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.27–3.43; p = 0.004). Steroid use was frequently related to RTx pneumonitis or esophagitis (29 patients, 43.3%). Prolonged high-dose steroid therapy and CCRTx were risk factors for PJP development among patients with lung cancer. As these patients had a poor prognosis, clinicians should consider PJP prophylaxis for high-risk patients with lung cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

We performed an in silico analysis to determine the concordance in the frequencies of actionable mutations and copy number alterations/aberrations (CNAs) in the two most common breast cancer histologies, invasive lobular and invasive ductal carcinoma. We found that targeted sequencing identified a larger number of mutational hotspots and clinically significant amplifications that would have been missed by WES and SNP arrays in many actionable genes such as PIK3CA, EGFR, AKT3, FGFR1, ERBB2, ERBB3 and ESR1. The striking differences between the number of mutational hotspots and CNAs generated from these platforms highlight a number of factors that should be considered in the interpretation of array and NGS-based genomic data for precision medicine.

Several oxaliplatin transporters were previously identified but their relative contributions to determining oxaliplatin tumour responses and gastrointestinal tumour cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin remains unclear. We studied clinical associations between tumour expression of oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes and patient response to oxaliplatin, then experimentally verified associations found with MRP2 in models of human gastrointestinal cancer. Among 18 oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes, MRP2 was the only one to be differentially expressed in the tumours of colorectal cancer patients who did or did not respond to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Over-expression of MRP2 (endogenously in HepG2 and PANC-1 cells, or induced by stable transfection of HEK293 cells) decreased oxaliplatin accumulation and cytotoxicity but those deficits were reversed by inhibition of MRP2 with myricetin or siRNA knockdown. Mice bearing subcutaneous HepG2 tumour xenografts were sensitised to oxaliplatin antitumour activity by concurrent myricetin treatment with little or no increase in toxicity. In conclusion, MRP2 limits oxaliplatin accumulation and response in human gastrointestinal cancer.

We compare optimized gene signatures for cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin responses in the same cell lines and validate each signature using data from patients with cancer. Supervised support vector machine learning is used to derive gene sets whose expression is related to the cell line GI50 values by backwards feature selection with cross-validation. Specific genes and functional pathways distinguishing sensitive from resistant cell lines are identified by contrasting signatures obtained at extreme and median GI50 thresholds. Ensembles of gene signatures at different thresholds are combined to reduce the dependence on specific GI50 values for predicting drug responses. The most accurate gene signatures for each platin are: cisplatin: BARD1, BCL2, BCL2L1, CDKN2C, FAAP24, FEN1, MAP3K1, MAPK13, MAPK3, NFKB1, NFKB2, SLC22A5, SLC31A2, TLR4, and TWIST1; carboplatin: AKT1, EIF3K, ERCC1, GNGT1, GSR, MTHFR, NEDD4L, NLRP1, NRAS, RAF1, SGK1, TIGD1, TP53, VEGFB, and VEGFC; and oxaliplatin: BRAF, FCGR2A, IGF1, MSH2, NAGK, NFE2L2, NQO1, PANK3, SLC47A1, SLCO1B1, and UGT1A1. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with bladder, ovarian, and colorectal cancer were used to test the cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin signatures, resulting in 71.0%, 60.2%, and 54.5% accuracies in predicting disease recurrence and 59%, 61%, and 72% accuracies in predicting remission, respectively. One cisplatin signature predicted 100% of recurrence in non-smoking patients with bladder cancer (57% disease-free; N = 19), and 79% recurrence in smokers (62% disease-free; N = 35).

MTH1 dephosphorylates oxidized nucleotides, thereby preventing their incorporation into DNA and protecting tumour cells from oxidative DNA damage. Inhibitors of MTH1 (TH588 and (S)-crizotinib) were shown to reduce cancer cell viability. However, the MTH1-dependency of the anti-cancer effects of these drugs has recently been questioned. Here, we have assessed anti-tumour effects of TH588 and (S)-crizotinib in patient-derived 3D colorectal cancer cultures. Hypoxia and reoxygenation – conditions that increase intracellular ROS levels – increased sensitivity to (S)-crizotinib, but not to TH588. (S)-crizotinib reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-MET and ErbB3 whereas TH588 induced a mitotic cell cycle arrest, which was not affected by adding ROS-modulating compounds. Furthermore, we show that both compounds induced DNA damage that could not be prevented by adding the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Moreover, adding ROS-modulating compounds did not alter the reduction in viability in response to TH588 and (S)-crizotinib. We conclude that TH588 and (S)-crizotinib have very clear and distinct anti-tumour effects in 3D colorectal cancer cultures, but that these effects most likely occur through distinct and ROS-independent mechanisms. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Iron deposits are a phenotypic trait of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Histological iron imaging and contrast-agent free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect these deposits, but their presence in human cancer, and correlation with immunotherapeutic response is largely untested. Here, primarily using these iron imaging approaches, we evaluated the spatial distribution of polarized macrophage populations containing high endogenous levels of iron in preclinical murine models and human breast cancer, and used them as metabolic biomarkers to correlate TAM infiltration with response to immunotherapy in preclinical trials. Macrophage-targeted inhibition of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) by immunotherapy was confirmed to inhibit macrophage accumulation and slow mammary tumor growth in mouse models while also reducing hemosiderin iron-laden TAM accumulation as measured by both iron histology and in vivo iron MRI (FeMRI). Spatial profiling of TAM iron deposit infiltration defined regions of maximal accumulation and response to the CSF1R inhibitor, and revealed differences between microenvironments of human cancer according to levels of polarized macrophage iron accumulation in stromal margins. We therefore demonstrate that iron deposition serves as an endogenous metabolic imaging biomarker of TAM infiltration in breast cancer that has high translational potential for evaluation of immunotherapeutic response. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "More than 50% of colon cancers bear mutations in p53, one of the most important tumor suppressors, and its family members p63 or p73 are expected to contribute to inhibiting the progression of colon cancers. The AP2 family also acts as a tumor suppressor. Here we found that p73 and AP2 are able to activate NEU4, a neuraminidase gene, which removes the terminal sialic acid residues from cancer-associated glycans. Under serum starvation, NEU4 was up-regulated and one of the NEU4 target glycans, sialyl Lewis X, was decreased, whereas p73 and AP2 were up-regulated. Sialyl Lewis X levels were not, however, decreased under starvation conditions in p73- or AP2-knockdown cells. p53 and AP2 underwent protein-protein interactions, exerting synergistic effects to activate p21, and interaction of p53 with AP2 was lost in cells expressing the L350P mutation of p53. The homologous residues in p63 and p73 are L423 and L377, respectively. The synergistic effect of p53/p63 with AP2 to activate genes was lost with the L350P/L423P mutation in p53/p63, but p73 bearing the L377P mutation was able to interact with AP2 and exerted its normal synergistic effects. We propose that p73 and AP2 synergistically activate the NEU4 promoter in colon cancer cells. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Nanoparticles prepared by single emulsion method had a size of less than 300 nm with 70.7 ± 3.9% reaction yield and 26.4 ± 1.1% Hsp loading capacity. Treatment of C6 glioma cells with HspNPs for 24 and 48 h resulted in dose- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability, with approximate IC50 of 28 and 21 μg/mL, respectively (p = .036 for 24 h, p = .025 for 48 h). The percentage of PCNA positive cells decreased to 20% and 10%, respectively, for Hsp- and HspNP-treated cells at concentration of 100 µg/mL. Treatment with increasing concentrations of HspNPs (25, 50, 75 and 100 µg/mL) resulted in 9.1-, 7-, 12.5- and 12.7-fold in increase in apoptotic cell number. Optimum doses of Hsp and HspNPs were found to increase oxidative damage in C6 glioma cells. MDA levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were found to be significantly elevated at 75 and 100 µg/mL exposure concentration of HspNPs with (p = .002) and (p = .018), respectively for 48-h treatment. The results obtained with this study showed biocompatible polymeric nanoparticle systems has great advantages to enhance anti-cancer activity and poor solubility of therapeutic agents. Overall our findings suggest that Hsp-loaded PLGA nanoparticle systems showed significant anti-cancer activity and HspNPs could be used as promising novel anti-cancer agent." ;

GO exhibits pH-dependent fluorescence emission in the visible/near-infrared, providing a possibility of molecular imaging and pH-sensing. It is also water soluble and has a substantial platform for functionalization, allowing for the delivery of multiple therapeutics. GO physical properties are modified to enhance cellular internalization, producing fluorescent nanoflakes with low (<15%) cytotoxicity at the imaging concentrations of 15 μg/mL. As a result, at lower flake sizes GO rapidly internalizes into HeLa cells with the following 70% fluorescence based clearance at 24 h, assessed by its characteristic emission in red/near-IR. pH-dependence of GO emission is utilized to provide the sensing of acidic extracellular environments of cancer cells. The results demonstrate diminishing green/red (550/630 nm) fluorescence intensity ratios for HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells in comparison to HEK-293 healthy cells suggesting a potential use of GO as a non-invasive optical sensor for cancer microenvironments.

There have been many attempts to identify markers and key pathways induced throughout EMT but the process is complex and depends on the cancer type and tumour microenvironment. Here we used the colon cancer cell line HT29, which stably overexpressed Snail, the key transcription factor in early EMT, as a model for colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with a pro-metastatic phenotype. We investigated miRNA expression regulation during that phenotypic switching. We found that overexpression of Snail in HT29 cells triggered significant changes in individual miRNA levels but did not change the global efficiency of miRNA processing. Snail abundance repressed the expression of miR-192 and miR-194 and increased miR-205, let-7i and SNORD13 levels. These identified changes correlated with the reported transcriptomic alterations in Snail-overexpressing HT29 cells. We also investigated how Snail affected the miRNA content of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from HT29 cells. Our data suggest that the presence of Snail significantly alters the complex mRNA/miRNA interactions in the early steps of metastasis and also has an impact on the content of EVs released from HT29 cells. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

This retrospective case-control study compared patients who had lung cancer with PJP (n = 112) or without PJP (n = 336) matched according to age, sex, histopathology, and stage. PJP definition was based on (i) positive PCR or direct immunofluorescence results for pneumocystis, (ii) clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities that were consistent with a pneumonic process, and (iii) received targeted PJP treatment. The development of PJP was associated with radiotherapy (RTx), concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRTx), lymphopenia, and prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (20 mg of prednisolone equivalent per day for ≥3 weeks). Multivariate analysis revealed independent associations with prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06–3.63; p = 0.032) and CCRTx (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.27–3.43; p = 0.004). Steroid use was frequently related to RTx pneumonitis or esophagitis (29 patients, 43.3%). Prolonged high-dose steroid therapy and CCRTx were risk factors for PJP development among patients with lung cancer. As these patients had a poor prognosis, clinicians should consider PJP prophylaxis for high-risk patients with lung cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

We performed an in silico analysis to determine the concordance in the frequencies of actionable mutations and copy number alterations/aberrations (CNAs) in the two most common breast cancer histologies, invasive lobular and invasive ductal carcinoma. We found that targeted sequencing identified a larger number of mutational hotspots and clinically significant amplifications that would have been missed by WES and SNP arrays in many actionable genes such as PIK3CA, EGFR, AKT3, FGFR1, ERBB2, ERBB3 and ESR1. The striking differences between the number of mutational hotspots and CNAs generated from these platforms highlight a number of factors that should be considered in the interpretation of array and NGS-based genomic data for precision medicine.

Several oxaliplatin transporters were previously identified but their relative contributions to determining oxaliplatin tumour responses and gastrointestinal tumour cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin remains unclear. We studied clinical associations between tumour expression of oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes and patient response to oxaliplatin, then experimentally verified associations found with MRP2 in models of human gastrointestinal cancer. Among 18 oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes, MRP2 was the only one to be differentially expressed in the tumours of colorectal cancer patients who did or did not respond to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Over-expression of MRP2 (endogenously in HepG2 and PANC-1 cells, or induced by stable transfection of HEK293 cells) decreased oxaliplatin accumulation and cytotoxicity but those deficits were reversed by inhibition of MRP2 with myricetin or siRNA knockdown. Mice bearing subcutaneous HepG2 tumour xenografts were sensitised to oxaliplatin antitumour activity by concurrent myricetin treatment with little or no increase in toxicity. In conclusion, MRP2 limits oxaliplatin accumulation and response in human gastrointestinal cancer.

We compare optimized gene signatures for cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin responses in the same cell lines and validate each signature using data from patients with cancer. Supervised support vector machine learning is used to derive gene sets whose expression is related to the cell line GI50 values by backwards feature selection with cross-validation. Specific genes and functional pathways distinguishing sensitive from resistant cell lines are identified by contrasting signatures obtained at extreme and median GI50 thresholds. Ensembles of gene signatures at different thresholds are combined to reduce the dependence on specific GI50 values for predicting drug responses. The most accurate gene signatures for each platin are: cisplatin: BARD1, BCL2, BCL2L1, CDKN2C, FAAP24, FEN1, MAP3K1, MAPK13, MAPK3, NFKB1, NFKB2, SLC22A5, SLC31A2, TLR4, and TWIST1; carboplatin: AKT1, EIF3K, ERCC1, GNGT1, GSR, MTHFR, NEDD4L, NLRP1, NRAS, RAF1, SGK1, TIGD1, TP53, VEGFB, and VEGFC; and oxaliplatin: BRAF, FCGR2A, IGF1, MSH2, NAGK, NFE2L2, NQO1, PANK3, SLC47A1, SLCO1B1, and UGT1A1. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with bladder, ovarian, and colorectal cancer were used to test the cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin signatures, resulting in 71.0%, 60.2%, and 54.5% accuracies in predicting disease recurrence and 59%, 61%, and 72% accuracies in predicting remission, respectively. One cisplatin signature predicted 100% of recurrence in non-smoking patients with bladder cancer (57% disease-free; N = 19), and 79% recurrence in smokers (62% disease-free; N = 35).

MTH1 dephosphorylates oxidized nucleotides, thereby preventing their incorporation into DNA and protecting tumour cells from oxidative DNA damage. Inhibitors of MTH1 (TH588 and (S)-crizotinib) were shown to reduce cancer cell viability. However, the MTH1-dependency of the anti-cancer effects of these drugs has recently been questioned. Here, we have assessed anti-tumour effects of TH588 and (S)-crizotinib in patient-derived 3D colorectal cancer cultures. Hypoxia and reoxygenation – conditions that increase intracellular ROS levels – increased sensitivity to (S)-crizotinib, but not to TH588. (S)-crizotinib reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-MET and ErbB3 whereas TH588 induced a mitotic cell cycle arrest, which was not affected by adding ROS-modulating compounds. Furthermore, we show that both compounds induced DNA damage that could not be prevented by adding the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Moreover, adding ROS-modulating compounds did not alter the reduction in viability in response to TH588 and (S)-crizotinib. We conclude that TH588 and (S)-crizotinib have very clear and distinct anti-tumour effects in 3D colorectal cancer cultures, but that these effects most likely occur through distinct and ROS-independent mechanisms. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Iron deposits are a phenotypic trait of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Histological iron imaging and contrast-agent free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect these deposits, but their presence in human cancer, and correlation with immunotherapeutic response is largely untested. Here, primarily using these iron imaging approaches, we evaluated the spatial distribution of polarized macrophage populations containing high endogenous levels of iron in preclinical murine models and human breast cancer, and used them as metabolic biomarkers to correlate TAM infiltration with response to immunotherapy in preclinical trials. Macrophage-targeted inhibition of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) by immunotherapy was confirmed to inhibit macrophage accumulation and slow mammary tumor growth in mouse models while also reducing hemosiderin iron-laden TAM accumulation as measured by both iron histology and in vivo iron MRI (FeMRI). Spatial profiling of TAM iron deposit infiltration defined regions of maximal accumulation and response to the CSF1R inhibitor, and revealed differences between microenvironments of human cancer according to levels of polarized macrophage iron accumulation in stromal margins. We therefore demonstrate that iron deposition serves as an endogenous metabolic imaging biomarker of TAM infiltration in breast cancer that has high translational potential for evaluation of immunotherapeutic response. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "More than 50% of colon cancers bear mutations in p53, one of the most important tumor suppressors, and its family members p63 or p73 are expected to contribute to inhibiting the progression of colon cancers. The AP2 family also acts as a tumor suppressor. Here we found that p73 and AP2 are able to activate NEU4, a neuraminidase gene, which removes the terminal sialic acid residues from cancer-associated glycans. Under serum starvation, NEU4 was up-regulated and one of the NEU4 target glycans, sialyl Lewis X, was decreased, whereas p73 and AP2 were up-regulated. Sialyl Lewis X levels were not, however, decreased under starvation conditions in p73- or AP2-knockdown cells. p53 and AP2 underwent protein-protein interactions, exerting synergistic effects to activate p21, and interaction of p53 with AP2 was lost in cells expressing the L350P mutation of p53. The homologous residues in p63 and p73 are L423 and L377, respectively. The synergistic effect of p53/p63 with AP2 to activate genes was lost with the L350P/L423P mutation in p53/p63, but p73 bearing the L377P mutation was able to interact with AP2 and exerted its normal synergistic effects. We propose that p73 and AP2 synergistically activate the NEU4 promoter in colon cancer cells. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Nanoparticles prepared by single emulsion method had a size of less than 300 nm with 70.7 ± 3.9% reaction yield and 26.4 ± 1.1% Hsp loading capacity. Treatment of C6 glioma cells with HspNPs for 24 and 48 h resulted in dose- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability, with approximate IC50 of 28 and 21 μg/mL, respectively (p = .036 for 24 h, p = .025 for 48 h). The percentage of PCNA positive cells decreased to 20% and 10%, respectively, for Hsp- and HspNP-treated cells at concentration of 100 µg/mL. Treatment with increasing concentrations of HspNPs (25, 50, 75 and 100 µg/mL) resulted in 9.1-, 7-, 12.5- and 12.7-fold in increase in apoptotic cell number. Optimum doses of Hsp and HspNPs were found to increase oxidative damage in C6 glioma cells. MDA levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were found to be significantly elevated at 75 and 100 µg/mL exposure concentration of HspNPs with (p = .002) and (p = .018), respectively for 48-h treatment. The results obtained with this study showed biocompatible polymeric nanoparticle systems has great advantages to enhance anti-cancer activity and poor solubility of therapeutic agents. Overall our findings suggest that Hsp-loaded PLGA nanoparticle systems showed significant anti-cancer activity and HspNPs could be used as promising novel anti-cancer agent." ;

GO exhibits pH-dependent fluorescence emission in the visible/near-infrared, providing a possibility of molecular imaging and pH-sensing. It is also water soluble and has a substantial platform for functionalization, allowing for the delivery of multiple therapeutics. GO physical properties are modified to enhance cellular internalization, producing fluorescent nanoflakes with low (<15%) cytotoxicity at the imaging concentrations of 15 μg/mL. As a result, at lower flake sizes GO rapidly internalizes into HeLa cells with the following 70% fluorescence based clearance at 24 h, assessed by its characteristic emission in red/near-IR. pH-dependence of GO emission is utilized to provide the sensing of acidic extracellular environments of cancer cells. The results demonstrate diminishing green/red (550/630 nm) fluorescence intensity ratios for HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells in comparison to HEK-293 healthy cells suggesting a potential use of GO as a non-invasive optical sensor for cancer microenvironments. The results of this work demonstrate the potential of GO as a novel multifunctional platform for therapeutic delivery, biological imaging and cancer sensing. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Patients with primary cervical cancer and newly diagnosed were selected from ten different cancer specialist hospitals of Malaysia. Patients’ demographic and clinical data were obtained for the prognostic analysis. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate patients’ survival time (CSS and OS) with DM status and values were compared using the log-rank test. A total of 19,785 newly diagnosed CC patients were registered during 2010–2016, among them only 16,946 (85.6%) with primary CC tumor. There was no difference in treatment modality between DM and non-DM patients. However intergroup assessment showed that type 2DM have significantly higher rate of mortality in both overall mortality (28.3%) and CC-specific (11.7%) as compared to Type 1DM (17.3%; 5.5%) and non DM patients (12.7%; 9.1%) (p < 0.001). Within group assessments showed that Type 2DM patients have better quality of life (mean 7.13 ± 3.67) (p < 0.001) and less distress levels (mean 2.41 ± 0.63) (p < 0.011) as compared to type1 DM (meant 10.54 ± 2.11; 3.19 ± 1.07).

In order to tackle cancer heterogeneity and comply with the data dimensionality, a number of network and pathway approaches were invented but rarely systematically applied to this task. We propose a new method, called NEAmarker, for finding sensitive and robust biomarkers at the pathway level. scores from network enrichment analysis transform the original space of altered genes into a lower-dimensional space of pathways. These dimensions are then correlated with phenotype variables. The method was first tested using in vitro data from three anti-cancer drug screens and then on clinical data of The Cancer Genome Atlas. It proved superior to the single-gene and alternative enrichment analyses in terms of (1) universal applicability to different data types with a possibility of cross-platform integration, (2) consistency of the discovered correlates between independent drug screens, and (3) ability to explain differential survival of treated patients. Our new screen of anti-cancer compounds validated the performance of multivariate models of drug sensitivity. The previously proposed methods of enrichment analysis could achieve comparable levels of performance in certain tests. However, only our method could discover predictors of both in vitro response and patient survival given administration of the same drug. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

SPIONs entrapped in the core of the nanocomplex may act as a hyperthermia agent and generate localized heat upon excitation with an alternating magnetic field (AMF), thus enabling a thermo-chemotherapy strategy for cancer treatment. Accordingly, the cytotoxic effect and the mode of cell death triggered by the nanocomplex in combination with AMF were evaluated on two different cancer cell lines with various folate receptor (FR) expression levels, including KB nasopharyngeal cancer cells overexpressing FRs as the model and MCF-7 breast cancer cells with low level of FRs as the blank sample. The obtained results showed that KB cell death was greater than the cell death observed in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, a majority of cell death in both cell lines were related to apoptosis when the folate-modified nanocomplex was used instated of the non-folate-modified nanocomplex. Therefore, functionalizing the nanocomplex with folate modulated the response to thermo-chemotherapy by shifting the cell death pathways toward apoptosis." ;

We examined TILs grades of pretreatment cancer tissue specimens and residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab and determined the predictive utility of the TILs grade in pathological complete response (pCR) and the prognostic power of TILs in HER2-positive breast cancer. This cohort study included 128 HER2-positive breast cancer who received NAC with trastuzumab. TILs grading of the tumor stroma in pretreatment biopsy specimens and residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab was categorized as low, intermediate, and high based on the criteria of the International Working Group. In current study, the pCR rate was 64.8%, and the Relapse-free survival (RFS) was significantly worse in the non-pCR group than in the pCR group. The pCR rate correlated with the TILs grade in pretreatment tumors. In 45 non-pCR patients, TILs grade was higher in the residual tumors than in the pretreatment tumors. The RFS was significantly better in residual tumors with high TILs grade than those with low TILs grade (p = 0.033). In conclusion, assessment of the TILs grade in residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab might be necessary to determine patients with good prognosis among those who do not achieve pCR. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Most targeting strategies of anticancer drug delivery systems (DDSs) rely on the surface functionalization of nanocarriers with specific ligands, which trigger the internalization in cancer cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The endocytosis implies the entrapment of DDSs in acidic vesicles (endosomes and lysosomes) and their eventual ejection by exocytosis. This process, intrinsic to eukaryotic cells, is one of the main drawbacks of DDSs because it reduces the drug bioavailability in the intracellular environment. The escape of DDSs from the acidic vesicles is, therefore, crucial to enhance the therapeutic performance at low drug dose. To this end, we developed a multifunctionalized DDS that combines high specificity towards cancer cells with endosomal escape capabilities. Doxorubicin-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles were functionalized with polyethylenimine, a polymer commonly used to induce endosomal rupture, and hyaluronic acid, which binds to CD44 receptors, overexpressed in cancer cells. We show irrefutable proof that the developed DDS can escape the endosomal pathway upon polymeric functionalization. Interestingly, the combination of the two polymers resulted in higher endosomal escape efficiency than the polyethylenimine coating alone. Hyaluronic acid additionally provides the system with cancer targeting capability and enzymatically controlled drug release. Thanks to this multifunctionality, the engineered DDS had cytotoxicity comparable to the pure drug whilst displaying high specificity towards cancer cells. The polymeric engineering here developed enhances the performance of DDS at low drug dose, holding great potential for anticancer therapeutic applications. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The use of oncolytic viruses (OVs) for cancer treatment is emerging as a successful strategy that combines the direct, targeted killing of the cancer with the induction of a long-lasting anti-tumor immune response. Using multiple aggressive murine models of triple-negative breast cancer, we have recently demonstrated that the early administration of oncolytic Maraba virus (MRB) prior to surgical resection of the primary tumor is sufficient to minimize the metastatic burden, protect against tumor rechallenge, cure a fraction of the mice and sensitize refractory tumors to immune checkpoint blockade without the need for further treatment. Here, we apply our surgical model to other OVs: Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Adenovirus (Ad), Reovirus (Reo) and Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and show that all of the tested OVs could positively change the outcome of the treated animals. The growth of the primary and secondary tumors was differently affected by the various OVs and most of the viruses conferred survival benefits in this neoadjuvant setting despite the absence of direct treatment following rechallenge. This study establishes that OV-therapy confers long-term protection when administered in the pre-operative window of opportunity. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase is overexpressed in approximately 15–20% of breast tumors and associated with aggressive disease and poor clinical outcome. p130Cas represents a nodal scaffold protein regulating cell survival, migration and proliferation in normal and pathological contexts. p130Cas overexpression in ErbB2 human breast cancer correlates with poor prognosis and metastasis formation. Recent data indicate that p130Cas association to ErbB2 protects ErbB2 from degradation, thus enhancing tumorigenesis. Therefore, inhibiting p130Cas/ErbB2 interaction might represent a new therapeutic strategy to target breast cancer. Here we demonstrate by performing Molecular Modeling, Molecular Dynamics, dot blot, ELISA and fluorescence quenching experiments, that p130Cas binds directly to ErbB2. Then, by structure-based virtual screening, we identified two potential inhibitors of p130Cas/ErbB2 interaction. Their experimental validation was performed in vitro and in ErbB2-positive breast cancer cellular models. The results highlight that both compounds interfere with p130Cas/ErbB2 binding and significantly affect cell proliferation and sensitivity to Trastuzumab. Overall, this study identifies p130Cas/ErbB2 complex as a potential breast cancer target revealing new therapeutic perspectives for protein-protein interaction (PPI). © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Gastric cancer (GC) ranks as the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, and approximately 42% of all cases diagnosed each year worldwide are diagnosed in China. A large number of clinical applications have revealed that Trametes robiniophila Μurr. (Huaier) exhibits an anti-tumour effect. However, loss of the bioactive components of Huaier during the extraction procedure with water is unavoidable, and the underlying mechanism of the anti-cancer effect of Huaier remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer effect of Huaier n-butanol extract, which contained 51.4% total flavonoids, on HGC27, MGC803, and AGS human GC cell lines in vitro. At a low concentration, Huaier n-butanol extract inhibited the growth of these GC cell types, induced cell cycle arrest and reduced cell metastasis. Moreover, Huaier n-butanol extract suppressed the c-Myc-Bmi1 signalling pathway, and overexpression of Bmi1 reversed the effects of Huaier n-butanol extract on GC cells. Thus, our findings indicate that Huaier n-butanol extract suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of GC cells via a c-Myc-Bmi1-mediated approach, providing a new perspective for our understanding of the anti-tumour effects of Huaier. These results suggest that Huaier n-butanol extract could be an attractive therapeutic adjuvant for the treatment of human GC. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

In the present study, we screened the anticancer potential of supernatant metabolites from eight native haloarchaeal strains obtained from a culture collection in Iran. Five human cancer cell lines including breast, lung, prostate and also human fibroblast cells as the normal control were used in the present study. Moreover, to evaluate the anti-tumor effect of the selected supernatant, inhibition of sphere formation and tumor development was assessed in-vitro and in-vivo, respectively. Among all strains, supernatant metabolites from Halobacterium salinarum IBRC M10715 had the most potent cytotoxic effect on prostate cancer cell lines (IC50 = 0.5 mg/mL) without any effects on normal cells. It significantly increased both early and late apoptosis (about 11% and 9%, respectively) in the androgen-dependent PC3 cell line, reduced sphere formation ability of DU145 and PC3 cells with down-regulation of SOX2 gene expression. Furthermore, our results revealed that tumors developed in nude mice significantly shrank post intratumor injection of metabolites of the haloarchaeal strain. In conclusion, we suggested here for the first time that supernatant metabolites from Halobacterium salinarum IBRC M10715 could be a novel component against prostate cancer in-vitro and in-vivo with remarkable reduction in stem-like properties of tumor. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

The main HNSCC risk factors are tobacco, excessive alcohol use, and the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV positive (+) cancers are etiologically different from other HNSCC and often show better prognosis. The current knowledge regarding HNSCC miRNA profiles is still incomplete especially in the context of HPV+ cancer. Thus, we analyzed 61 freshly collected primary oral (OSCC) and oropharyngeal (OPSCC) SCC samples. HPV DNA and RNA was found in 21% cases. The Illumina whole-genome small-RNA profiling by next-generation sequencing was done on 22 samples and revealed 7 specific miRNAs to HPV+ OSCC, 77 to HPV+ OPSCC, and additional 3 shared with both; 51 miRNAs were specific to HPV− OPSCC, 62 to HPV− OSCC, and 31 shared with both. The results for 9 miRNAs (miR-9, -21, -29a, -100, -106b, -143 and -145) were assessed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction on the whole study population. The data was additionally confirmed by reanalyzing publicly available miRNA sequencing Cancer Genome Atlas consortium (TCGA) HNSCC data. Cell signaling pathway analysis revealed differences between HPV+ and HPV− HNSCC. Our findings compared with literature data revealed extensive heterogeneity of miRNA deregulation with only several miRNAs consistently affected, and miR-9 being the most likely HPV related miRNA. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Development of combined therapies constitutes an effective strategy to inhibit cancer cells and prevent the emergence of drug resistance. For this purpose, we investigated the anti-tumoral effect of thirteen phenolic compounds, from the Tunisian quince Cydonia oblonga Miller, alone or combined to 5-FU, on the human 5-FU-resistant LS174-R colon cancer cells in comparison to parental cells. Our results showed that only Kaempferol was able to chemo-sensitize 5-FU-resistant LS174-R cells. This phenolic compound combined with 5-FU exerted synergistic inhibitory effect on cell viability. This combination enhanced the apoptosis and induced cell cycle arrest of both chemo-resistant and sensitive cells through impacting the expression levels of different cellular effectors. Kaempferol also blocked the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and modulated the expression of JAK/STAT3, MAPK, PI3K/AKT and NF-κB. In silico docking analysis suggested that the potent anti-tumoral effect of Kaempferol, compared to its two analogs (Kaempferol 3-O-glucoside and Kampferol 3-O-rutinoside), can be explained by the absence of glucosyl groups. Overall, our data propose Kaempferol as a potential chemotherapeutic agent to be used alone or in combination with 5-FU to overcome colon cancer drug resistance. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Considering the high prevalence and mortality rate of colorectal cancer, in this study we tried to design and validate a standard printed form and evaluate oncologists’ and nurses’ adherence to this form. This cross-sectional study was performed in Omid hospital, Mashhad, Iran from January 2015 to October 2015. A Chemotherapy form including various demographic and clinical parameters and approved chemotherapy regimens for colorectal cancer was designed by the clinical pharmacist and validated by clinical oncologists working in this center. All eligible patients admitted in this center during this period of time were included in the study. Adherence of the oncologists and nurses to this form and probable medication errors were identified by the pharmacy student. Sixty-seven patients with colorectal cancer and a total of 251 chemotherapy courses were evaluated. All patients received regimens compatible with developed form but in 206 courses (98.56%) of chemotherapy dosing error happened and in most of cases patients received lower than calculated dose (37.8%). Three errors occurred in administration step by nurses which they infused the medication in shorter than recommended duration. In general, oncologists’ adherence with developed form for chemotherapy of colorectal cancer was relatively high, except in dose calculation. Avoiding from rounding the calculated medications’ doses and precise calculation of patients’ body surface area can prevent most of medication errors and reduce risk of adverse drug reaction occurrence. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

Nevertheless, the importance of transfusion timing is still unclear. The primary purpose of this study is to appraise whether the receipt of intraoperative blood transfusion (BT) differ from postoperative BT in regards to cancer outcomes in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients treated with nephrectomy. Data on 1168 patients with RCC, who underwent radical or partial nephrectomy as primary therapy between 1988–2013 were analyzed. PBT was defined as transfusion of allogeneic red blood cells (RBC) during surgery or the postsurgical period. Survival was analyzed and compared using the Kaplan–Meier method with the log-rank test. Of 1168 patients, 198 patients (16.9%) received a PBT. Including 117 intraoperative BT and 81 postoperative BT. Only 21 (10.6%) patients required both intraoperative and postoperative BT. On multivariate analyses, receipt of PBT was associated with significantly worse local disease recurrence (HR: 2.4; P = 0.017), metastatic progression (HR: 2.7; P = 0.005), cancer-specific mortality (HR: 3.5; P = 0.002) and all-cause mortality (HR: 2.1; P = 0.005). Nevertheless, postoperative BT was not independently associated with increased risk of local recurrence (p = 0.1), metastatic progression (P = 0.16) or kidney cancer death (P = 0.63), yet did significantly increase the risk of overall mortality (HR: 2.6; P = 0.004).

For this reason novel therapies accounting for PDAC peculiarities, such as the relevant stromal reaction, are urgently needed. Here adipose mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (AD-MSC) have been armed to constantly release a soluble trimeric and multimeric variant of the known anti-cancer TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (sTRAIL). This cancer gene therapy strategy was in vitro challenged demonstrating that sTRAIL was thermally stable and able to induce apoptosis in the PDAC lines BxPC-3, MIA PaCa-2 and against primary PDAC cells. sTRAIL released by AD-MSC relocated into the tumor stroma was able to significantly counteract tumor growth in vivo with a significant reduction in tumor size, in cytokeratin-7+ cells and by an anti-angiogenic effect. In parallel, histology on PDAC specimens form patients (n = 19) was performed to investigate the levels of TRAIL DR4, DR5 and OPG receptors generating promising insights on the possible clinical translation of our approach. These results indicate that adipose MSC can very efficiently vehicle a novel TRAIL variant opening unexplored opportunities for PDAC treatment. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Malignant melanoma is one of the untreatable cancers in which conventional therapeutic strategies, including chemotherapy, are hardly effective. Therefore, identification of novel therapeutic targets involved in melanoma progression is urgently needed for developing effective therapeutic methods. Overexpression of interleukin-13 receptor α2 (IL13Rα2) is observed in several cancer types including glioma and pancreatic cancer. Although IL13Rα2 is implicated in the progression of various types of cancer, its expression and roles in the malignant melanoma have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we showed that IL13Rα2 was expressed in approximately 7.5% melanoma patients. While IL13Rα2 expression in human melanoma cells decreased their proliferation in vitro, it promoted in vivo tumour growth and angiogenesis in melanoma xenograft mouse model. We also found that the expression of amphiregulin, a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, was correlated with IL13Rα2 expression in cultured melanoma cells, xenograft tumour tissues and melanoma clinical samples. Furthermore, expression of amphiregulin promoted tumour growth, implicating causal relationship between the expression of IL13Rα2 and amphiregulin. These results suggest that IL13Rα2 enhances tumorigenicity by inducing angiogenesis in malignant melanoma, and serves as a potential therapeutic target of malignant melanoma. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

However, its prognostic value and the underlying mechanism in lung cancer remains unclear. Herein we evaluated the expression of PKD2 in lung adenocarcinoma and investigated its relationship with EMT. GSEA, TCGA and K-M plotter database were applied and revealed that high PKD2 expression predicted poor outcome and related with lymph nodes metastasis in lung cancer. IHC and qRT-PCR were performed and found PKD2 was elevated in lung adenocarcinoma and negatively related with OS (p = 0.015), PFS (p = 0.006) and the level of E-cadherin (p = 0.021). Experiment in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines demonstrated up-regulation of PKD2 led to high expression of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vim, mmp9 et al.) and EMT transcription factors(zeb1, twist, snail), and the results were reversed when PKD2 was knocked down. Further investigation showed that abrogation of PKD2 inhibited A549 cell migration, invasion, proliferation and induced cell arrest in G2/M phase. We concluded that high expression of PKD2 was associated with poor prognosis and cancer progression in lung adenocarcinoma patients by promoting EMT. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

We showed for the first time that Raman imaging can be used to distinguish successfully between glycosylated and nonglycosylated proteins in normal and cancer tissue. Thousands of protein, lipid and glycan species exist in cells and tissues and their metabolism is monitored via numerous pathways, networks and methods. The metabolism can change in response to cellular environment alterations, such as development of a disease. Measuring such alterations and understanding the pathways involved are crucial to fully understand cellular metabolism in cancer development. In this paper Raman markers of glycogen, glycosaminoglycan, chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate proteoglycan were identified based on their vibrational signatures. High spatial resolution of Raman imaging combined with chemometrics allows separation of individual species from many chemical components present in each cell. We have found that metabolism of proteins, lipids and glycans is markedly deregulated in breast (adenocarcinoma) and brain (medulloblastoma) tumors. We have identified two glycoforms in the normal breast tissue and the malignant brain tissue in contrast to the breast cancer tissue where only one glycoform has been identified. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Very recently, we postulated that the incorporation of citral into nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC-Citral) improves solubility and delivery of the citral without toxic effects in vivo. Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate anti-cancer effects of NLC-Citral in MDA MB-231 cells in vitro through the Annexin V, cell cycle, JC-1 and fluorometric assays. Additionally, this study is aimed to effects of NLC-Citral in reducing the tumor weight and size in 4T1 induced murine breast cancer model. Results showed that NLC-Citral induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest in MDA MB-231 cells. Furthermore, a prominent anti-metastatic ability of NLC-Citral was demonstrated in vitro using scratch, migration and invasion assays. A significant reduction of migrated and invaded cells was observed in the NLC-Citral treated MDA MB-231 cells. To further evaluate the apoptotic and anti-metastatic mechanism of NLC-Citral at the molecular level, microarray-based gene expression and proteomic profiling were conducted. Based on the result obtained, NLC-Citral was found to regulate several important signaling pathways related to cancer development such as apoptosis, cell cycle, and metastasis signaling pathways. Additionally, gene expression analysis was validated through the targeted RNA sequencing and real-time polymerase chain reaction. In conclusion, the NLC-Citral inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells in vitro, majorly through the induction of apoptosis, anti-metastasis, anti-angiogenesis potentials, and reducing the tumor weight and size without altering the therapeutic effects of citral. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The incidence of developing cancer should increase with the body mass, yet is not the case, a conundrum referred to as Peto’s paradox. Elephants have a lower incidence of cancer suggesting that these animals have probably evolved different ways to protect themselves against the disease. The paradox is worth revisiting with the realization that most mammals encode an endogenous APOBEC3 cytidine deaminase capable of mutating single stranded DNA. Indeed, the mutagenic activity of some APOBEC3 enzymes has been shown to introduce somatic mutations into genomic DNA. These enzymes are now recognized as causal agent responsible for the accumulation of CG- > TA transitions and DNA breaks leading to chromosomal rearrangements in human cancer genomes. Here, we identified an elephant A3Z1 gene, related to human APOBEC3A and showed that it could efficiently deaminate cytidine, 5-methylcytidine and produce DNA breaks leading to massive apoptosis, similar to other mammalian APOBEC3A enzymes where body mass varies by up to four orders of magnitude. Consequently, it could be considered that eAZ1 might contribute to cancer in elephants in a manner similar to their proposed role in humans. If so, eAZ1 might be particularly well regulated to counter Peto’s paradox. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

The cells and mitochondria were isolated from cancerous and non-cancerous ovarian tissues and exposed to IC 50 concentration of F1 fraction for evaluation of mitochondrial and cellular parameters. Our results showed that F1 fraction of T. coronatus crude extract significantly induced toxic effects only in the cancerous ovarian mitochondria, including increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, mitochondrial swelling, and cytochrome c release.Flow-cytometry analysis demonstrated that F1 fraction of T. coronatus progressively induced apoptosis and necrosis only on EOC but not non-cancerous cells.

Biotin-PEG-PCL polymers have been used for targeted drug delivery to cancer, as well as to improve the pharmacokinetics of the drug and reduce its effects. In this study, biotin-conjugated copolymers were fabricated with polymerization of the ring opening method and the properties of copolymer and nanoparticles were investigated using various techniques. The toxicity of artemisinin and its nanoparticles have been investigated on MCF-7 and normal HFF2 cells. The results showed that the encapsulation efficacy of artemisinin in nanoparticles was 45.5 ± 0.41%. The release profile of the drug indicates that the release is slow and controlled and is approximately pH dependent. The results of artemisinin cell culture on human breast cancer cells showed that biotin-PEG-PCL nanoparticles had an inhibitory effect on MCF-7 cells and had no toxic effects on HFF2 cells. Anticancer activity in vivo in the 4T1 breast cancer model showed that tumour volumes were decreased up 40 mm3 by ART-loaded micelles and 76 mm3 by free ART, compared to the control group (2150 mm). In vivo results showed that this formulation significantly increases the accumulation of substances in the tumours. Therefore, the molecular formulation of ART-based copolymers can be a desirable process for cancer treatment purposes. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group." ;

Previous reports have shown the effectiveness of BP in treating cancer diseases. However, BP has no targeting capacity towards specific cancer cells. To improve treatment efficiency and reduce the dose of BP used in cancer treatment, targeting-based approaches should be developed. In the present study, we used riboflavin-5′-phosphate (RFMP) immobilized iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4 MNPs) as carriers for BP to treat cancer cell lines derived from liver, prostate and breast. These model cancer cells overexpress riboflavin receptors on their cell membrane and are also sensitive to BP treatment. Thus, BP-binding free RFMP on MNPs can be used as probes to target these model cells, whereas BP can be readily released on target cancer cells. Cell viability was twofold lower by using Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs immobilized with BP than that achieved by using free-form BP at a similar amount. Moreover, BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs have no apparent harmful effects on non-target cells. In addition, we evaluated the level of cysteine-aspartic acid protease 3 (caspase 3) in the resultant cell lysate obtained after treatment by BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs to demonstrate that apoptosis is mainly involved in the growth inhibition of target cells. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Patients with laryngeal cancer (ICD-10: C32) between 2009 and 2010 were retrospectively identified and tracked until 2015 using the Korean Health Insurance claims database. During the seven-year follow-up period, 5,322 subjects were newly diagnosed with larynx cancer. The mean age of people with laryngeal cancer was much higher than those without (63.29 vs. 47.7 years, p < 0.0001), and the incidence of larynx cancer in men was much higher than that in women (93.16% vs. 6.84%, p < 0.0001). Age, gender, smoking status, alcohol intake, and exercise-adjusted hazard ratios indicated that participants with MetS had a 1.13-fold higher hazard of having larynx cancer than those without MetS. The number of MetS components was a strong risk factor for laryngeal cancer with a higher risk estimate of this cancer in both ex- and current smokers as well as people who have never smoked. MetS was found to be an independent risk factor for the incidence of laryngeal cancer.

        fabio:abstract    "Chromosome changes are one of the hallmarks of human malignancies. Chromosomal rearrangement is frequent in human cancers. One of the consequences of chromosomal rearrangement is gene fusions in the cancer genome. We have previously identified a panel of fusion genes in aggressive prostate cancers. In this study, we showed that 6 of these fusion genes are present in 7 different types of human malignancies with variable frequencies. Among them, the CCNH-C5orf30 and TRMT11-GRIK2 gene fusions were found in breast cancer, colon cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, ovarian cancer and liver cancer, with frequencies ranging from 12.9% to 85%. In contrast, four other gene fusions (mTOR-TP53BP1, TMEM135-CCDC67, KDM4-AC011523.2 and LRRC59-FLJ60017) are less frequent. Both TRMT11-GRIK2 and CCNH-C5orf30 are also frequently present in lymph node metastatic cancer samples from the breast, colon and ovary. Thus, detecting these fusion transcripts may have significant biological and clinical implications in cancer patient management. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Quantifying the genetic correlation between cancers can provide important insights into the mechanisms driving cancer etiology. Using genome-wide association study summary statistics across six cancer types based on a total of 296,215 cases and 301,319 controls of European ancestry, here we estimate the pair-wise genetic correlations between breast, colorectal, head/neck, lung, ovary and prostate cancer, and between cancers and 38 other diseases. We observed statistically significant genetic correlations between lung and head/neck cancer (r g = 0.57, p = 4.6 × 10 −8 ), breast and ovarian cancer (r g = 0.24, p = 7 × 10 −5 ), breast and lung cancer (r g = 0.18, p =1.5 × 10 −6 ) and breast and colorectal cancer (r g = 0.15, p = 1.1 × 10 −4 ). We also found that multiple cancers are genetically correlated with non-cancer traits including smoking, psychiatric diseases and metabolic characteristics.

        fabio:abstract    "Purpose: Several previous studies have shown that oral bisphosphonates (BPs) are associated with the incidence of 13 specific cancers, including lung cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the findings are heterogeneous. Methods and results: Relevant studies published in databases such as PubMed, Embase database, and Cochrane library were systematically retrieved from inception to August 25th, 2018, regardless of language, by two investigators independently. Afterwards, the maximum adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted from the retrieved studies. Finally, 13 cohort studies involving 1,510,763 participants were enrolled into this meta-analysis. No significant relationship was found between oral BPs and the risk of all-cause cancer in osteoporosis (OP) patients among the entire population (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80–1.18; I 2 92.5%). Besides, oral BPs could remarkably reduce the incidence of breast cancer (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68–0.92; I 2 54%) and endometrial cancer (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64–0.96; I 2 0%) in postmenopausal OP females. In addition, oral BPs were also found to evidently reduce the incidence of upper gastrointestinal cancer in OP patients among the entire population (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54–0.98; I 2 36.1%). However, oral BPs may lead to increased risk of liver cancer in mixed genders (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.03–2.77; I 2 30.7%). Conclusions: Taken together, oral BPs do not increase the risk of incidence of all-cause cancer; instead, they can reduce the incidence of breast, endometrial, and upper gastrointestinal cancers among the postmenopausal OP females. Our analysis stratified by gender suggests that oral BPs may increase the incidence of liver cancer in mixed genders, while no significant association was observed in females. Careful analysis of post-marketing data should be conducted to address the clinical relevance of our results on the putative association of oral BP use and liver cancer suggested by our meta-analysis. © 2018, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation." ;

However, it remains unclear how cancer cells migrate in the three-dimensional (3D) matrix of cancer tissues and how CAFs support the cancer invasion. Here we propose a novel mechanism of fibroblast-dependent cancer cell invasion in the 3D collagen matrix. Human cancer cell lines from the pancreas (Panc-1), lung (A549) and some other organs actively adhered to normal fibroblasts and primary lung CAFs in cultures. To show its significance in tumor invasion, we designed a new invasion assay in which homogeneous microspheroids consisting of cancer cells and fibroblasts were embedded into collagen gel. Time-lapse experiments showed that cancer cells adhered to and quickly migrated on the long protrusions of fibroblasts in the 3D collagen matrix. Fibroblast-free cancer cells poorly invaded the matrix. Experiments with function-blocking antibodies, siRNAs, and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that cancer cells adhered to fibroblasts through integrin α5β1-mediated binding to fibronectin on the surface of fibroblasts. Immunochemical analyses of the co-cultures and lung cancers suggested that cancer cells could acquire the migratory force by the fibronectin/integrin signaling. Our results also revealed that the fibroblast-bound fibronectin was a preferential substrate for cancer cells to migrate in the collagen matrix. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

However, very few studies investigated the role of integrin α3 (ITGα3) in malignant cancers. Here, we determined the functional role of ITGα3 in pancreatic cancer. Analysis of public microarray databases and Western blot analysis indicated a unique expression of ITGα3 in human pancreatic cancer. Silencing ITGα3 expression significantly inhibited the viability and migration of human pancreatic cancer cells. Notably, ablation of ITGα3 expression resulted in a significant decrease of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression compared with transfection of control-siRNA through an increased number of leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domain protein 1 (LRIG1) expression. In addition, ablating ITGα3 inhibited tumour growth via blockade of EGFR signalling in vivo. Furthermore, the highly expressed ITGα3 led to a poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. Our results provide novel insights into ITGα3-induced aggressive pancreatic cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Since epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in promoting metastasis of cancer, many mechanisms regarding EMT have been studied. We previously showed that Ribonucleic acid export 1 (RAE1) is dysregulated in breast cancer and its overexpression leads to aggressive breast cancer phenotypes by inducing EMT. Here, we evaluated the functional capacity of RAE1 in breast cancer metastasis by using a three-dimensional (3D) culture system and xenograft models. Furthermore, to investigate the mechanisms of RAE1-driven EMT, in vitro studies were carried out. The induction of EMT with RAE1-overexpression was confirmed under the 3D culture system and in vivo system. Importantly, RAE1 mediates upregulation of an EMT marker ZEB1, by binding to the promoter region of ZEB1. Knockdown of ZEB1 in RAE1-overexpressing cells suppressed invasive and migratory behaviors, accompanied by an increase in epithelial and a decrease in mesenchymal markers. Taken together, these data demonstrate that RAE1 contributes to breast cancer metastasis by regulating a key EMT-inducing factor ZEB1 expression, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Obesity is a risk factor for many cancers including breast, esophageal, colon, and thyroid cancer. We aimed to evaluate the association of thyroid cancer with body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and weight change. This nationwide population-based cohort study included 11,323,006 adults who joined the national health screening program. Weight change was defined as the difference between the weight of the subjects measured during the study period and the weight at the time of four years ago. For evaluating the association between the weight change and the risk of thyroid cancer, subjects without weight change for four years were defined as the reference group. Mean age was 50.1 ± 13.7 years and 44% were female. In total, 50,464 subjects (0.4%) had newly-diagnosed thyroid cancer. After multivariable analyses, the incidence of thyroid cancer increased significantly in subjects with larger WC as well as higher BMI (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). In subjects who were lean and became obese, the incidence of thyroid cancers increased significantly (hazard ratio [HR] 1.15 [1.11–1.19]). In subjects who were obese and became lean, the incidence of thyroid cancers decreased significantly (HR 0.89 [0.86–0.93]). These results demonstrated that higher BMI and larger WC were significantly associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer. Weight gain in lean subjects was associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer, and weight reduction in subjects with obesity was associated with a decreased risk of thyroid cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

In order to understand this increase, country specific dietary exposures have been investigated. The aim of this study was to quantify the association between consumption of brown cheese, a common bread topping in Norway, and colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer in the prospective Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) Study. Data on brown cheese consumption and adjustment factors was available for 82 527 women. During a mean of 14.6 years of follow-up (1.2 million person-years), there were 1360 cases of colorectal cancer (907 colon; 453 rectal). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer sites. We modelled restricted cubic splines with 4 knots, to assess a possible non-linear relationship between brown cheese intake and the investigated cancer sites. In the age-adjusted model, consumption of more than 2 slices (>16 grams) of brown cheese per day was associated with 13% reduced risk of colon cancer (95% CI 4%-21%) compared to women who did not consume brown cheese. The multivariable-adjusted model, however, showed no association between brown cheese consumption and the risk of colorectal, colon, or rectal cancer (colorectal: HR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.76–1.13, p-trend 0.37; colon: HR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.65–1.06; p-trend = 0.10; rectal: HR = 1.16, 95% CI 0.84–1.1.61, p-trend = 0.41). In this large, prospective cohort study of women, consumption of brown cheese was suggestively protective against colon cancer. However, adjustment attenuated the inverse risk association. Brown cheese consumption was not associated with rectal cancer, or colorectal cancer overall. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Current cancer diagnosis utilizes histopathology, which requires tissue acquisition, extensive processing and, in most cases, relies on the qualitative morphological analysis of tissues and cells. Molecular biomarkers are only available for a few specific tumor subtypes. We discovered that the fluorescence polarization (Fpol) of Methylene Blue (MB) is significantly higher in cancer than in normal human breast tissues and cells. We confirmed that fluorescence polarization imaging did not affect the viability of the cells and yielded highly significant differences between cancer and normal cells using MB concentrations as low as 0.05 and 0.01 mg/ml. To explain this phenomenon we examined intracellular localization of MB and its fluorescence lifetime. We determined that higher fluorescence polarization of MB occurs due to its increased accumulation in mitochondria of cancer cells, as well as shorter fluorescence lifetime in cancer relative to normal cells. As quantitative MB Fpol imaging can be performed in vivo and in real time, it holds the potential to provide an accurate quantitative marker of cancer at the cellular level. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

The anticancer polymers are designed to target anionic lipids exposed on the cancer cell surfaces and act by disrupting the cancer cell membranes. Because the polymer mechanism is not dependent on cell proliferation, we hypothesized that the polymers were active against dormant cancer cells. The polymers exhibited cytotoxicity to proliferating prostate cancer. Importantly, the polymer killed dormant prostate cancer cells that were resistant to docetaxel. This study demonstrates a new approach to discover novel anticancer therapeutics. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

We developed a novel computational platform applying a multi-modal approach to filter out passengers and more robustly identify putative driver genes. The primary filter identifies enrichment of cancer mutations in CATH functional families (CATH-FunFams) – structurally and functionally coherent sets of evolutionary related domains. Using structural representatives from CATH-FunFams, we subsequently seek enrichment of mutations in 3D and show that these mutation clusters have a very significant tendency to lie close to known functional sites or conserved sites predicted using CATH-FunFams. Our third filter identifies enrichment of putative driver genes in functionally coherent protein network modules confirmed by literature analysis to be cancer associated. Our approach is complementary to other domain enrichment approaches exploiting Pfam families, but benefits from more functionally coherent groupings of domains. Using a set of mutations from 22 cancers we detect 151 putative cancer drivers, of which 79 are not listed in cancer resources and include recently validated cancer associated genes EPHA7, DCC netrin-1 receptor and zinc-finger protein ZNF479. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Cox proportional hazards models were used. Males and females classified as obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg /m −2 ) have a 33% and 22% increased risk of all-cancer, respectively, than their normal weight counterparts. Similar all-cancer risk increases are observed for those above sex-specific WC guidelines.

Collectively, 86.3% (63/73) of HAMPs have recurrent alterations in at least 1 cancer type and 16 HAMPs, including 9 understudied HAMPs, are identified as putative therapeutic targets across multiple cancer types. For example, the recurrent focal amplification of BRD9 is observed in 9 cancer types and genetic depletion of BRD9 inhibits tumor growth.

        fabio:abstract    "The current system for evaluating prostate cancer architecture is the Gleason grading system which divides the morphology of cancer into five distinct architectural patterns, labeled 1 to 5 in increasing levels of cancer aggressiveness, and generates a score by summing the labels of the two most dominant patterns. The Gleason score is currently the most powerful prognostic predictor of patient outcomes; however, it suffers from problems in reproducibility and consistency due to the high intra-observer and inter-observer variability amongst pathologists. In addition, the Gleason system lacks the granularity to address potentially prognostic architectural features beyond Gleason patterns. We evaluate prostate cancer for architectural subtypes using techniques from topological data analysis applied to prostate cancer glandular architecture. In this work we demonstrate the use of persistent homology to capture architectural features independently of Gleason patterns. Specifically, using persistent homology, we compute topological representations of purely graded prostate cancer histopathology images of Gleason patterns 3,4 and 5, and show that persistent homology is capable of clustering prostate cancer histology into architectural groups through a ranked persistence vector. Our results indicate the ability of persistent homology to cluster prostate cancer histopathology images into unique groups with dominant architectural patterns consistent with the continuum of Gleason patterns. In addition, of particular interest, is the sensitivity of persistent homology to identify specific sub-architectural groups within single Gleason patterns, suggesting that persistent homology could represent a robust quantification method for prostate cancer architecture with higher granularity than the existing semi-quantitative measures. The capability of these topological representations to segregate prostate cancer by architecture makes them an ideal candidate for use as inputs to future machine learning approaches with the intent of augmenting traditional approaches with topological features for improved diagnosis and prognosis. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Accumulative studies demonstrate that UHRF1 is broadly overexpressed in cancers, which contributes to cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Interestingly, a proteasome-dependent downregulation of UHRF1 has been observed in pluripotent ground state mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) cultured in the presence of two kinase (MEK1/MEK2 and GSK3β) inhibitors (termed 2i), raising the question whether UHRF1 is similarly regulated in cancer cells. Here we present evidence that while addition of 2i broadly downregulates UHRF1 and DNMT1 in various cancer cells, distinct underlying mechanisms are involved. In contrast to mESCs, 2i-induced downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in cancer cells cannot be rescued by proteasome inhibitor and occurs primarily at the level of transcription. Furthermore, downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 by 2i is due to inhibition of MEK1/MEK2, but not GSK3β activity. Data mining reveals a marked co-expression of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in normal tissues as well as cancers. We provide evidence that multiple transcription factors including E2F1 and SP1 mediate the transcriptional activation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 by the activated MEK/ERK pathway. Together our study reveals distinct regulation of UHRF1/DNMT1 in mESCs and cancer cells and identifies activated MEK/ERK pathway as a driving force for coordinated and aberrant over-expression of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in cancers. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

When it is applied to cancer cells, solid stress hinders their proliferation rate and promotes cancer cell invasion and metastatic potential.

Here, we used two pancreatic cancer cell lines and an established in vitro system to study the effect of solid stress-induced signal transduction on pancreatic cancer cell migration as well as the mechanism involved. Our results show that the migratory ability of cells increases as a direct response to solid stress. We also found that Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) expression and secretion is strongly upregulated in pancreatic cancer cells in response to mechanical compression. Performing a phosphoprotein screening, we identified that solid stress activates the Akt/CREB1 pathway to transcriptionally regulate GDF15 expression, which eventually promotes pancreatic cancer cell migration. Our results suggest a novel solid stress signal transduction mechanism bringing GDF15 to the centre of pancreatic tumor biology and rendering it a potential target for future anti-metastatic therapeutic innovations. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

We have reported that mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mitROS) upregulate uptake transporter of porphyrins, heme carrier protein-1 (HCP-1). The accumulation of cancer-specific porphyrins was increased by mitROS production, thereby the cancer-specific PDT cytotoxicity was enhanced. Thus we investigated whether mitROS production by hyperthermia can enhanced the cytotoxicity of PDT or not. In this study, 1 h of hyperthermia at 42 °C increased the mitROS production, and both the accumulation of cancer-specific porphyrins and the PDT cytotoxicity increased. Moreover, the authors treated cells with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) to examine the effect of mitROS. NAC inhibited the increasing ROS production after hyperthermia to restrain the post-treatment increase of cancer-specific porphyrins accumulation. Moreover, the increase of ROS production in cancer cells after hyperthermia upregulated HCP-1 expression and downregulated ABCG2 expression. These regulation were inhibited by NAC. These results suggest that hyperthermia treatment increased mitROS production, which involved HpD accumulation and enhanced PDT effects in cancer cells. The mechanism of this phenomenon was most likely to be due to both the upregulation of HCP-1 and the downregulation of ABCG2 by mitROS. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Recent studies showed that changes to the gut microbiome alters the microbiome-derived metabolome, potentially promoting carcinogenesis in organs that are distal to the gut. In this study, we assessed the relationship between breast cancer and cadaverine biosynthesis. Cadaverine treatment of Balb/c female mice (500 nmol/kg p.o. q.d.) grafted with 4T1 breast cancer cells ameliorated the disease (lower mass and infiltration of the primary tumor, fewer metastases, and lower grade tumors). Cadaverine treatment of breast cancer cell lines corresponding to its serum reference range (100–800 nM) reverted endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, inhibited cellular movement and invasion, moreover, rendered cells less stem cell-like through reducing mitochondrial oxidation. Trace amino acid receptors (TAARs), namely, TAAR1, TAAR8 and TAAR9 were instrumental in provoking the cadaverine-evoked effects. Early stage breast cancer patients, versus control women, had reduced abundance of the CadA and LdcC genes in fecal DNA, both responsible for bacterial cadaverine production. Moreover, we found low protein expression of E. coli LdcC in the feces of stage 1 breast cancer patients. In addition, higher expression of lysine decarboxylase resulted in a prolonged survival among early-stage breast cancer patients. Taken together, cadaverine production seems to be a regulator of early breast cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

The specific function of CBX6 in breast cancer is currently undefined. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset led to the identification of CBX6 as a consistently downregulated gene in breast cancer. We provided evidence showing enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) negatively regulated CBX6 expression in a Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)-dependent manner. Exogenous overexpression of CBX6 inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation, and induced cell cycle arrest along with suppression of migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro. Microarray analyses revealed that CBX6 governs a complex gene expression program. Moreover, CBX6 induced significant downregulation of bone marrow stromal cell antigen-2 (BST2), a potential therapeutic target, via interactions with its promoter region. Our collective findings support a tumor suppressor role of CBX6 in breast cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "MRI plays important roles in endometrial and cervical cancer assessment, from detection to recurrent disease evaluation. Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common malignant tumor of the female genital tract in Western countries. EC patients are divided into risk categories based on histopathological tumor type, grade, and myometrial invasion depth. EC is surgically staged using the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) system. Since FIGO (2009) stage correlates with prognosis, preoperative staging is essential for tailored treatment. MRI reveals myometrial invasion depth, which correlates with tumor grade and lymph node metastases, and thus correlates with prognosis. Cervical cancer (CC) is the second most common cancer, and the third leading cause of cancer-related death among females in developing countries. The FIGO Gynecologic Oncology Committee recently revised its CC staging guidelines, allowing staging based on imaging and pathological findings when available. The revised FIGO (2018) staging includes node involvement and thus enables both therapy selection and evaluation, prognosis estimation, and calculation of end results. MRI can accurately assess prognostic indicators, e.g., tumor size, parametrial invasion, pelvic sidewall, and lymph node invasion. Despite these important roles of MRI, radiologists still face challenges due to the technical and interpretation pitfalls of MRI during all phases of endometrial and cervical cancer evaluation. Awareness of mimics that can simulate both cancers is critical. With careful application, functional MRI with DWI and DCE sequences can help establish a correct diagnosis, although it is sometimes necessary to perform biopsy and histopathological analysis. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

This led to the first biological based liquid biopsy test, which we called MATER-D platform. In the present study, we showed for the first time that a different type of OMCs (PTEN-deficient human epithelial MCF10A cells) turn malignant when exposed to cancer patient’s sera, confirming the concept that different cells with diverse oncosuppressor mutations can uptake cancer factors and be used in biological based liquid biopsy tests. Our observations were confirmed in a large variety of solid and haematological malignancies. This test was able to detect dysplasia and carcinomas in situ lesions in different organs and circulating factors in cancer patients years after the removal of their lesions. To our knowledge, this ability is unique and not shared by other liquid biopsy platforms. Immunohistochemistry analysis of the xenotransplants revealed identical patterns of differentiation regardless of the cancer type, showing that differentiation through horizontal transfer might be dependent on the nature of the target cells rather than the type of cancer factors. These data strengthen the notion that OMC-based liquid biopsy tests might be promising platforms for cancer screening. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Various studies have shown the significance of identifying drug targets for cancer, although this process continues challenging in the field of anti-cancer drug designing. The primary purpose of this study is to design a novel approach to identify target genes for cancer. The sub-network of colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancers were constructed from human protein–protein interaction network. The potential genes were analyzed using hubs and centrality measures. For the identification of target genes, we retrieve those genes that had the highest score in both mutation rates and graph centrality. Moreover, gene deletion analysis revealed that MYC, TP53, and EGFR genes remained potential targets in colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancer respectively. Results suggest that combining network measures with mutation frequencies in cancer genes might assist in recognizing several potential drug targets. Future enhancement of this current approach is to combine these network properties with the biological insights from gene expression data, and their functions will provide a reliable method for rational drug designing. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature." ;

Owing to enhanced permeability and retention in solid tumor tissue, nanoparticle (NP) delivery systems have been emerged as novel strategy in cancer chemotherapy. As extracellular matrix, glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) could bind its surface receptor adhesion molecule CD44 which is strongly expressed on breast cancer. We have previously reported a doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded HA-Lys-LA X-NPs (X-NP-DOX) NP delivery system for breast cancer treatment. In this study, we further investigated the antitumor effect of X-NP-DOX NP delivery system using low-dose DOX in both in vitro and in vivo systems. We demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX possessed the ability for inhibiting MCF-7 breast cancer cell growth, invasion, and migration, and inducing apoptosis in vitro. In in vivo experiments, injection of low-dose X-NP-DOX into tumor-bearing mouse resulted in significant reduction of tumor size. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining further revealed that low-dose X-NP-DOX induced higher percentage of apoptotic cells compared with free DOX or saline. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX inhibited Notch1 and Ras/MAPK pathways, decreased cancer stem cell population, and reduced tumorigenesis compared to free DOX in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Owing to its enhanced efficacy and higher targetability compared to free DOX, low-dose DOX delivered by NP system may be a promising novel strategy for breast cancer treatment." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Breast cancer survivors display altered inflammatory responses to immune challenges relative to cancer-naive controls likely due to previous cancer treatments, stress associated with cancer, and/or tumor physiology. Proper inflammatory responses are necessary for adaptive sickness behaviors (e.g., fatigue, anorexia, and fever) and neuroinflammatory pathways are also implicated in mental health disturbances (e.g., cognitive impairment, depression) suffered by cancer patients and survivors. Rodent cancer models indicate that tumors are sufficient to exacerbate neuroinflammatory responses after an immune challenge, however primary tumors are not usually present in cancer survivors, and the behavioral consequences of these brain changes remain understudied. Therefore, we tested the extent to which mammary tumor resection attenuates tumor-induced neuroinflammation and sickness behavior following an immune challenge (i.p. lipopolysaccharide [LPS] injection) in mice. Tnf-α, Il-1β, and Il-6 mRNA decreased in multiple brain regions of LPS-treated tumor-bearing mice relative to LPS-treated controls; tumor resection attenuated these effects in some cases (but not Tnf-α). Tumors also attenuated sickness behaviors (hypothermia and lethargy) compared to LPS-treated controls. Tumor resection reversed these behavioral consequences, although basal body temperature remained elevated, comparable to tumor-bearing mice. Thus, tumors significantly modulate neuroinflammatory pathways with functional consequences and tumor resection mitigates most, but not all, of these changes. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Although substantial advances have been obtained both in treatment and survival rates, there is still a need for new therapeutical approaches. Natural compounds are a realistic source of new bioactive compounds with anticancer activity. Among them, rosemary polyphenols have shown a vast antiproliferative capacity against colon cancer cells in vitro and in animal models. We have investigated the antitumor activity of a rosemary extract (RE) obtained by using supercritical fluid extraction through its capacity to inhibit various signatures of cancer progression and metastasis such as proliferation, migration, invasion and clonogenic survival. RE strongly inhibited proliferation, migration and colony formation of colon cancer cells regardless their phenotype. Treatment with RE led to a sharp increase of intracellular ROS that resulted in necrosis cell death. Nrf2 gene silencing increased RE cytotoxic effects, thus suggesting that this pathway was involved in cell survival. These in vitro results were in line with a reduction of tumor growth by oral administration of RE in a xenograft model of colon cancer cells using athymic nude mice. These findings indicate that targeting colon cancer cells by increasing intracellular ROS and decreasing cell survival mechanisms may suppose a therapeutic option in colon cancer through the combination of rosemary compounds and chemotherapeutic drugs. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Although cure rates are high for early stage disease, clinical outcomes for advanced, metastatic, or recurrent disease remain poor. To change this panorama, a deeper understanding of cervical cancer biology and novel study models are needed. Immortalized human cancer cell lines such as HeLa constitute crucial scientific tools, but there are few other cervical cancer cell lines available, limiting our understanding of a disease known for its molecular heterogeneity. This study aimed to establish novel cervical cancer cell lines derived from Brazilian patients. We successfully established one (HCB-514) out of 35 cervical tumors biopsied. We confirmed the phenotype of HCB-514 by verifying its’ epithelial and tumor origin through cytokeratins, EpCAM and p16 staining. It was also HPV-16 positive. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) showed relevant somatic mutations in several genes including BRCA2, TGFBR1 and IRX2. A copy number variation (CNV) analysis by nanostring and WES revealed amplification of genes mainly related to kinases proteins involved in proliferation, migration and cell differentiation, such as EGFR, PIK3CA, and MAPK7. Overexpression of EGFR was confirmed by phospho RTK-array and validated by western blot analysis. Furthermore, the HCB-514 cell line was sensitive to cisplatin. In summary, this novel Brazilian cervical cancer cell line exhibits relevant key molecular features and constitutes a new biological model for pre-clinical studies. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Oncogene-induced replication stress (RS) promotes cancer development but also impedes tumor growth by activating anti-cancer barriers. To determine how cancer cells adapt to RS, we have monitored the expression of different components of the ATR-CHK1 pathway in primary tumor samples. We show that unlike upstream components of the pathway, the checkpoint mediators Claspin and Timeless are overexpressed in a coordinated manner. Remarkably, reducing the levels of Claspin and Timeless in HCT116 cells to pretumoral levels impeded fork progression without affecting checkpoint signaling. These data indicate that high level of Claspin and Timeless increase RS tolerance by protecting replication forks in cancer cells. Moreover, we report that primary fibroblasts adapt to oncogene-induced RS by spontaneously overexpressing Claspin and Timeless, independently of ATR signaling. Altogether, these data indicate that enhanced levels of Claspin and Timeless represent a gain of function that protects cancer cells from of oncogene-induced RS in a checkpoint-independent manner. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Turmeric, since in ancient Indian traditional medicinal system, has been implicated for its therapeutic and chemopreventive properties against a broad spectrum of diseases. Curcumin, the active polyphenol from turmeric, helps to obstruct the growth of many types of cancers at various stages which include prostrate, melanoma, breast, brain tumor, pancreatic, leukemia, etc. The initiation and recurrence of cancer have been attributed to few mutated cells in bulk of tumor called as cancer stem cells which have the capacity of self-renewal and differentiation. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3B) is a multifunctional serine/threonine protein kinase, originally found in mammals, an important component of diverse signaling pathways, dysregulation of which leads to affect the cancer stem cell properties. The nutritional- and phytochemical-based dietary interventions may complement current chemotherapy to prevent recurrence and relapse of cancer. The objective of present study is to investigate the effect of retinoic acid and curcumin–retinoic acid conjugates against GSK-3B protein. The in silico results indicate that molecule 3 (curcumin–retinoic acid conjugates) might be a potent inhibitor of GSK-3B and a novel future drug candidate for the treatment of cancer. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature." ;

        fabio:abstract    "In this study, we aimed to identify mutations of key genes associated with docetaxel resistance in nine endometrial cancer cell lines. Endometrial cancers are associated with several critical gene mutations, including PIK3A, PTEN, and KRAS. Different gene mutations in endometrial cancer cells have varied responses to anticancer drugs and cancer therapies. The most frequently altered gene in endometrioid endometrial carcinoma tumors is PTEN. PTEN protein has lipid phosphatase and protein phosphatase activity, as well as other functions in the nucleus. Although the tumor-suppressive function of PTEN has mainly been attributed to its lipid phosphatase activity, a role for PTEN protein phosphatase activity in cell cycle regulation has also been suggested. Various tumor type-specific PTEN mutations are well documented. Here, nine endometrioid endometrial cancer cell lines with PIK3A, PTEN, and KRAS gene mutations were treated with docetaxel and radiation. One mutation with a docetaxel drug-resistant effect was a truncated form of PTEN. Among PTEN mutations in endometrial cancer cells, the Y68 frame shift mutation of PTEN constitutes a major mechanism of resistance to docetaxel treatment. The molecular mechanism involves truncation of the 403 amino acid PTEN protein at amino acid 68 by the Y68 frame shift, leading to the loss of PTEN protein phosphatase and lipid phosphatase activities. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Hence to mimic such complex biological processes, an understanding of stimuli responsiveness is needed to sense specific changes and respond in a predictable manner. Such responses due to polymers may take place either simultaneously at the site or in a sequential manner from preparation to transporting pathways to cellular compartments. The present review comprehends the stimuli-responsive polymers and multi-responsiveness with respect to cancer therapy. It focuses on the exploitation of different stimuli like temperature, pH and enzymes responsiveness in a multi-stimuli setting. Nanogels and micelles being two of the most commonly used responsive polymeric carriers have also been discussed. The role of multiple stimuli delivery system is significant due to multiple changes happening in the near surroundings of cancer cells. These responsive materials are able to mimic some biological processes and recognize at the molecular level itself to manipulate development of custom-designed molecules for targeting cancer cells." ;

In contrast, antibodies to BLV were found in a very small percentage of healthy blood donors. There was no association between BLV DNA and other tumor prognostic biological markers such as hormonal receptors, HER2 oncoprotein, proliferation index, metastasis in sentinels lymph nodes, and tumor grade and size. Our findings suggest that BLV should be considered a potential predisposing factor to breast cancer in women. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Here we report that ovarian cancer cells manifest a spectrum of tumorigenic phenotypes upon knockdown of PIK3R1. PIK3R1 loss activates AKT and p110-independent JAK2/STAT3 signaling through inducing changes in the phosphorylation of the docking protein Gab2, thereby relieving the negative inhibition on AKT and promoting the assembly of JAK2/STAT3 signalosome, respectively. Additional mechanisms leading to AKT activation include enhanced p110α kinase activity and a decrease in PTEN level. PIK3R1 loss renders ovarian cancer cells vulnerable to inhibition of AKT or JAK2/STAT3. The combination of AKT and STAT3 inhibitors significantly increases the anti-tumor effect compared to single-agent treatments.

Finally, analysis of 214 prostate and 35 breast cancer genomes reveal that late-replicating regions are prone to cis and early-replication to trans chromosomal rearrangements.

        fabio:abstract    "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are promising therapies for haematological cancers. Historically, their therapeutic benefit is due to ADC targeting of lineage-restricted antigens. The C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is attractive for targeted therapy of haematological cancers, given its expression in multiple tumour types and role in cancer “homing” to bone marrow. However, CXCR4 is also expressed in haematopoietic cells and other normal tissues, raising safety challenges to the development of anti-CXCR4 ADCs for cancer treatment. Here, we designed the first anti-CXCR4 ADC with favourable therapeutic index, effective in xenografts of haematopoietic cancers resistant to standard of care and anti-CXCR4 antibodies. We screened multiple ADC configurations, by varying type of linker-payload, drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR), affinity and Fc format. The optimal ADC bears a non-cleavable linker, auristatin as payload at DAR = 4 and a low affinity antibody with effector–reduced Fc. Contrary to other drugs targeting CXCR4, anti-CXCR4 ADCs effectively eliminated cancer cells as monotherapy, while minimizing leucocytosis. The optimal ADC selectively eliminated CXCR4 + cancer cells in solid tumours, but showed limited toxicity to normal CXCR4 + tissues, sparing haematopoietic stem cells and progenitors. Our work provides proof-of-concept that through empirical ADC design, it is possible to target proteins with broad normal tissue expression. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Cancers in the bone produce a number of severe symptoms including pain that compromises patient functional status, quality of life, and survival. The source of this pain is multifaceted and includes factors secreted from tumor cells. Malignant cells release the neurotransmitter and cell-signaling molecule glutamate via the oxidative stress-related cystine/glutamate antiporter, system x C − , which reciprocally imports cystine for synthesis of glutathione and the cystine/cysteine redox cycle. Pharmacological inhibition of system x C − has shown success in reducing and delaying the onset of cancer pain-related behavior in mouse models. This investigation describes the development of a stable siRNA-induced knockdown of the functional trans-membrane system x C − subunit xCT (SLC7A11) in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Clones were verified for xCT knockdown at the transcript, protein, and functional levels. RNAseq was performed on a representative clone to comprehensively examine the transcriptional cellular signature in response to xCT knockdown, identifying multiple differentially regulated factors relevant to cancer pain including nerve growth factor, interleukin-1, and colony-stimulating factor-1. Mice were inoculated intrafemorally and recordings of pain-related behaviors including weight bearing, mechanical withdrawal, and limb use were performed. Animals implanted with xCT knockdown cancer cells displayed a delay until the onset of nociceptive behaviors relative to control cells. These results add to the body of evidence suggesting that a reduction in glutamate release from cancers in bone by inhibition of the system x C − transporter may decrease the severe and intractable pain associated with bone metastases. © The Author(s) 2018." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Background: The global cancer incidence and the number of survivors are increasing. Therefore, it is necessary to pay more attention to the side effects of treatment. Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of reflexology on the side effects of chemotherapy in cancer patients. Method: For finding the related articles, the researchers searched several databases including PubMed &ProQuest and valid websites including ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Scientific Information Database, and Magiran. The key terms of \"reflexology, cancer, and chemotherapy\" individually and combined together were searched in Parisian and English, and the studies performed from 2009 to 2018 were extracted. Due to the lack of sufficient studies carried out into the outcome of reflexology on chemotherapy, both Persian and English articles were used. Results: A total of 57 studies were extracted from the databases and valid websites; five of which met the inclusion criteria. All selected studies were clinical trials. Implications for Practice: Reflexology can be used as a non-pharmacologic nursing intervention to alleviate the side effects of chemotherapy and improve the quality of life of cancer patients. © 2018 Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

        fabio:abstract    "CD47 is a prominent new target in cancer immunotherapy, with antagonistic antibodies currently being evaluated in clinical trials. For effective evaluation of this strategy it is crucial to identify which patients are suited for CD47-targeted therapy. In this respect, expression of the pro-phagocytic signal SLAMF7 on both macrophages and cancer cells was recently reported to be a requisite for CD47 antibody-mediated phagocytosis. Here, we demonstrate that in fact SLAMF7 expression on cancer cells is not required and does not impact on CD47 antibody therapy. Moreover, SLAMF7 also does not impact on phagocytosis induction by CD20 antibody rituximab nor associates with overall survival of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma patients. In contrast, expression of CD47 negatively impacts on overall and progression free survival. In conclusion, cancer cell expression of SLAMF7 is not required for phagocytosis and, in contrast to CD47 expression, should not be used as selection criterion for CD47-targeted therapy. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Increased Crabp2 levels have been found in various types of cancer, and are associated with poor patients’ survival. Although Crabp2 is found to be overexpressed in lung cancer, its role in metastasis of lung cancer is unclear. In this study, Crabp2 was overexpressed in high-metastatic C10F4 than low-metastatic lung cancer cells. Analysis of clinical samples revealed that high CRABP2 levels were correlated with lymph node metastases, poor overall survival, and increased recurrence. Knockdown of Crabp2 decreased migration, invasion, anoikis resistance, and in vivo metastasis. Crabp2 was co-immunoprecipitated with HuR, and overexpression of Crabp2 increased HuR levels, which promoted integrin β1/FAK/ERK signaling. Inhibition of HuR or integrin β1/FAK/ERK signaling reversed the promoting effect of Crabp2 in migration, invasion, and anoikis resistance. Knockdown of Crabp2 further inhibited the growth of cancer cells as compared with that by gemcitabine or irinotecan alone. The expression of Crabp2 in human lung tumors was correlated with stress marker CHOP. In conclusion, our findings have identified the promoting role of Crabp2 in anoikis resistance and metastasis. CRABP2 may serve as a prognostic marker and targeting CRABP2 may be exploited as a modality to reduce metastasis. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "SPG-56 is a newly isolated glycoprotein from sweet potatoes (Zhongshu NO. 1), but its value for suppressing breast cancer progression remains unknown. This study was designed to investigate the potential anti-cancer effects of SPG-56, which consists of 2.9% sugar and 97.1% protein. The effects of SPG-56 on the proliferation and apoptosis of breast cancer cells were determined using CCK-8 and Hoechst 33342 assays and flow cytometry, after staining with Annexin V and PI respectively. The activities of SPG-56 against breast cancer were examined using female BALB/c nude mice orthotopically implanted with human breast carcinoma cells of the types MCF-7 and 4T1-Luc. The cellular experiments showed that SPG-56 inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of MCF-7 cells dose- and time-dependently. Oral administration of SPG-56 significantly suppressed the development of MCF-7 tumor cells (P < 0.01) as compared with an untreated group. The serum tumor markers CEA, CA125 and CA153 in a 240 mg/kg/d SPG-56 decreased by 54.8%, 91.8%, and 90.3%, respectively. The experiments further demonstrated that SPG-56 inhibited the metastasis of breast cancer in MCF-7 and 4T1-bearing mice by altering the expression of MMP2, MMP9, VEGF, Occludin and Claudin. It is concluded that SPG-56 may have potential as a novel anti-tumor candidate for breast cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Lymph node metastasis is of major prognostic significance for breast cancer. Lymph node metastasis arises at a very early stage in some patients. Using the data downloaded from the TCGA database, we studied the differences between primary tumors with and without lymph node metastasis at the multi-omics level using bioinformatics approaches. Our study found that low mutation and neoantigen burdens correlated with lymph node metastazation of breast cancer. All three conserved domains in TP53 were mutated in lymph node-negative breast cancers, whereas only one domain was mutated in lymph node-positive samples. Mutations in microtubule-related proteins appear to help immune cells recognize tumors and inhibit their lymph node metastasis. Destroying microtubule-related proteins is a potential therapeutic strategy to inhibit lymph node metastasis of breast cancer. As the neoantigens specifically present in lymph node-positive breast cancers, MAPK10, BC9L, TRIM65, CD93, KITLG, CNPPD1, CPED1, CCDC146, TMEM185A, INO80D, and PSMD11 are potential targets for vaccine design. In the tumor microenvironment, reduced numbers of effector immune cells, especially activated memory CD4+ T cells and activated mast cells, facilitate breast cancer metastasis to the lymph nodes. According to transcriptome data, lymph node metastasis was mostly driven by gene mutation rather than by gene expression. Although differential gene expression analysis was based on lymph node metastasis status, many genes were shown to be differentially expressed based on estrogen receptor status. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Fibroblasts turn into cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumour microenvironment. CAFs have recently attracted attention for their function as a regulator of immune cell recruitment and function in addition to their tumour-promoting roles. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of CAFs on monocyte recruitment and macrophage polarization in breast cancer. CAFs, which were α-SMA expressing fibroblasts in contrast to normal fibroblasts (NFs), effectively recruited monocytes. Recruitment of monocytes by CAFs might be mediated by monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) as well as stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) cytokines. CAFs differentiated the recruited monocytes into M2-like macrophages which are capable of exerting their immunosuppressive roles via the PD-1 axis. CAF-educated monocytes exhibited strong immune suppression unlike NF-educated monocytes and enhanced the motility/invasion of breast cancer cells in addition to increasing the expressions of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes and vimentin protein in cancer cells. CAF-educated M1 macrophages displayed increased expression of M2 markers and production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in contrast to decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12 compared with control M1 macrophages; suggesting that CAFs were also able to induce the trans-differentiation of M1 macrophages to M2 macrophages. We then investigated the relationship between the infiltration of CAFs and tumour associated macrophages (TAMs) using tissue samples obtained from breast cancer patients. High grade of CAFs significantly correlated with the number of TAMs in human breast cancer tissue samples. It was also associated with higher Ki-67 proliferation index, and higher tumour volume. This result is in line with our finding of increased breast cancer cell proliferation due to the effects of CAF-educated monocytes in vitro. Our results concluded that CAFs play pivotal roles in sculpturing the tumour microenvironment in breast cancer, and therapeutic strategies to reverse the CAF-mediated immunosuppressive microenvironment should be taken into consideration. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

We construct iCells of four cancers and the corresponding tissue controls and identify the most rewired genes in cancer.

We biologically validate that they have a role in cancer by knockdown experiments followed by cell viability assays.

Our method achieves an accuracy of 96% for RNA-seq and 95% for mixed DNA-seq and RNA-seq identification. Even for a panel of only 94 cancer-related genes, accuracy remains at 82% but decreases when using smaller panels.

The angular spectra of scattering coefficient maps of normal tissues exhibit a spatial feature distinct from those of abnormal tissues. An angular spectrum index to quantify the differences between the normal and abnormal tissues is derived, and its strength in revealing subsurface cancer in ex vivo samples is statistically analyzed.

        fabio:abstract    "Metastatic colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer death. Current options in palliation such as hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) present severe side effects. Recent research efforts suggested the therapeutic use of oxidant-enriched liquid using cold physical plasma. To investigate a clinically accepted treatment regimen, we assessed the antitumor capacity of plasma-treated saline solution. In response to such liquid, CT26 murine colon cancer cells were readily oxidized and showed cell growth with subsequent apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and upregulation of immunogenic cell death (ICD) markers in vitro. This was accompanied by marked morphological changes with re-arrangement of actin fibers and reduced motility. Induction of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype was not observed. Key results were confirmed in MC38 colon and PDA6606 pancreatic cancer cells. Compared to plasma-treated saline, hydrogen peroxide was inferiorly toxic in 3D tumor spheroids but of similar efficacy in 2D models. In vivo, plasma-treated saline decreased tumor burden in Balb/C mice. This was concomitant with elevated numbers of intratumoral macrophages and increased T cell activation following incubation with CT26 cells ex vivo. Being a potential adjuvant for HIPEC therapy, our results suggest oxidizing saline solutions to inactivate colon cancer cells while potentially stimulating antitumor immune responses. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Although solid fuel combustion emissions are known to increase the prevalence of illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer, however, their effect on the eyes is underexplored. This study assesses the acute toxicity of solid fuel combustion emissions on healthy ocular cells and a cancer cell line. Three healthy ocular cell lines (corneal, lens, and retinal epithelial cells) and a cancer cell line (Chinese hamster ovary cells) were exposed to liquid and gas phase emissions from applewood and coal combustion. Following the exposure, real-time cell attachment behavior was monitored for at least 120 hours with electrical cell impedance spectroscopy. The viability of the cells, amount of apoptotic cells, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were quantified with MTT, ApoTox-Glo, and ROS-Glo H 2 O 2 assays, respectively. The results showed that coal emissions compromised the viability of ocular cells more than applewood emissions. Interestingly, the cancer cells, although their viability was not compromised, generated 1.7 to 2.7 times more ROS than healthy cells. This acute exposure study provides compelling proof that biomass combustion emissions compromise the viability of ocular cells and increase ROS generation. The increased ROS generation was fatal for ocular cells, but it promoted the growth of cancer cells. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) include endogenous metabolites that provide information about health and disease which might be useful to develop a better screening method for breast cancer. The goal of this study was to classify mice with and without tumors and compare tumors localized to the mammary pad and tumor cells injected into the iliac artery by differences in VOCs in urine. After 4T1.2 tumor cells were injected into BALB/c mice either in the mammary pad or into the iliac artery, urine was collected, VOCs from urine headspace were concentrated by solid phase microextraction and results were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry quadrupole time-of-flight. Multivariate and univariate statistical analyses were employed to find potential biomarkers for breast cancer and metastatic breast cancer in mice models. A set of six VOCs classified mice with and without tumors with an area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC AUC) of 0.98 (95% confidence interval [0.85, 1.00]) via five-fold cross validation. Classification of mice with tumors in the mammary pad and iliac artery was executed utilizing a different set of six VOCs, with a ROC AUC of 0.96 (95% confidence interval [0.75, 1.00]). © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

In an additional two metastatic colon cancer patients, we detected CD8 + neoantigen-specific cells targeting the mutated SMAD5 and MUC4 proteins.

Moreover, the high drug loading capacity of Cet-SLN was employed to encapsulate photothermal agent indocyanine green (ICG) to finally fabricate a versatile drug delivery system (DDS) able to co-deliver Cet and ICG (Cet-SLN/ICG) for combinational chemo-photothermal therapy of breast cancer. The obtained results clearly demonstrated that Cet-SLN/ICG was well-dispersed nanoparticles with preferable stability under physiological condition. Furthermore, due to the conjugation of Cet, Cet-SLN/ICG could target EGFR which overexpress in MCF-7 cells. Most importantly, both in vitro and in vivo results suggested that compared with Cet or ICG alone, the Cet-SLN/ICG showed superior anticancer efficacy. In conclusion, Cet-SLN/ICG could be a potential platform for effective combinational chemo-photothermal therapy for breast cancer." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The integration of genomic and DNA methylation data has been demonstrated as a powerful strategy in understanding cancer mechanisms and identifying therapeutic targets. The TCGA consortium has mapped DNA methylation in thousands of cancer samples using Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 K BeadChip (Illumina 450 K array) that only covers about 1.5% of CpGs in the human genome. Therefore, increasing the coverage of the DNA methylome would significantly leverage the usage of the TCGA data. Here, we present a new model called EAGLING that can expand the Illumina 450 K array data 18 times to cover about 30% of the CpGs in the human genome. We applied it to analyze 13 cancers in TCGA. By integrating the expanded methylation, gene expression, and somatic mutation data, we identified the genes showing differential patterns in each of the 13 cancers. Many of the triple-evidenced genes identified in majority of the cancers are biomarkers or potential biomarkers. Pan-cancer analysis also revealed the pathways in which the triple-evidenced genes are enriched, which include well known ones as well as new ones, such as axonal guidance signaling pathway and pathways related to inflammatory processing or inflammation response. Triple-evidenced genes, particularly TNXB, RRM2, CELSR3, SLC16A3, FANCI, MMP9, MMP11, SIK1, and TRIM59 showed superior predictive power in both tumor diagnosis and prognosis. These results have demonstrated that the integrative analysis using the expanded methylation data is powerful in identifying critical genes/pathways that may serve as new therapeutic targets. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

However, macrophages make up a majority of immune cell infiltrates into tumors, creating natural targets for immunotherapies able to direct macrophages away from tumor-supportive functions and toward anti-tumor phenotypes. Recent studies demonstrate that toll-like receptors (TLRs) – pathways that quickly trigger early immune responses – play an important role in polarizing macrophages. Here, we present emerging ways in which TLR signaling is being manipulated in macrophages to create new opportunities for cancer immunotherapy. In particular, we discuss approaches to deliver TLR agonists, to leverage biomaterials in these therapies, and to couple TLR-based approaches with other frontline treatments as combination cancer therapies. © 2018" ;

We analyzed the immune profiles, T cell cytotoxicity, and TCR repertoire of peripheral blood, normal lung tissue, and tumor tissue from NSCLC patients. By using bispecific T-cell engager technology to assess the cytotoxicity of T cells, we found that the cytotoxicity of tumor-infiltrated T cells closely correlated with that of peripheral T cells. This correlation was supported by the immune profiles, cytokine production, and results of the TCR repertoire analysis from these specimens. We also found that the cytotoxicity of peripheral T cells has potential as a predictor of the effects of nivolumab in the tumor microenvironment.

This standard procedure relies on the slow radioactivity loss, usually attributed to the limited tumour expression of G6P-phosphatase (G6Pase). However, this classical interpretation intrinsically represents an approximation since, as in all tissues, cancer G6Pase activity is remarkable and is confined to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whose lumen must be reached by phosphorylated FDG to explain its hydrolysis and radioactivity release. The present study tested the impact of G6Pase sequestration on the mathematical description of FDG trafficking and handling in cultured cancer cells. Our data show that accounting for tracer access to the ER configures this compartment as the preferential site of FDG accumulation. This is confirmed by the reticular localization of fluorescent FDG analogues. Remarkably enough, reticular accumulation rate of FDG is dependent upon extracellular glucose availability, thus configuring the same ER as a significant determinant of cancer glucose metabolism. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Although current methods of treatment for cervical cancer can ablate lesions, preventing metastatic disseminations and excessive tissue injuries still remains a major concern. Hence, development of a safer and more efficient treatment modality is of vital importance. Natural products from plants are one of the principal sources of precursors to lead compounds with direct pharmaceutical application across all disease classes. One of these plants is Ficus carica, whose fruit latex, when applied on HPV-induced skin warts, has shown potential as a possible cure for this virus related lesions. This study explores the in vitro biological activities of fig latex and elucidates its possible mechanisms of action on cervical cancer cell lines CaSki and HeLa positive for HPV type 16 and 18, respectively. Our data shows that fig latex inhibits properties that are associated with HPV-positive cervical cancer transformed cells such as rapid growth and invasion and substantially downregulated the expression of p16 and HPV onco-proteins E6, E7. These findings suggest Ficus carica latex has the potential to be used in the development of therapeutic modalities for the possible treatment, cure and prevention of HPV related cervical cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing methods, the diversity and composition of the microbiota from ovarian cancer tissues (25 samples) and normal distal fallopian tube tissues (25 samples) were analyzed. High-throughput sequencing showed that the diversity and richness indexes were significantly decreased in ovarian cancer tissues compared to tissues from normal distal fallopian tubes. The ratio of the two phyla for Proteobacteria/Firmicutes was notably increased in ovarian cancer, which revealed that microbial composition change might be associated with the process of ovarian cancer development. In addition, transcriptome-sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses suggested that the transcriptional profiles were statistically different between ovarian carcinoma and normal distal fallopian tubes. Moreover, a set of genes including 84 different inflammation-associated or immune-associated genes, which had been named as the human antibacterial-response genes were also modulated expression.

        fabio:abstract    "Several pioneering work have established that apart from genetic alterations, epigenetic modifications contribute significantly in tumor progression. Remarkable role of EZH2 in cancer highlights the importance of identifying its targets. Although much emphasis has been placed in recent years in designing drugs and inhibitors targeting EZH2, less effort has been given in exploring its existing targets that will help in understanding the oncogenic role of EZH2 in turn which may provide a more stringent method of targeting EZH2. In the present study, we validated six direct targets of EZH2 that are GPNMB, PMEPA1, CoL5A1, VGLL4, POMT2 and SUMF1 associated with cancer related pathways. Upon EZH2 knockdown, more than two fold increase in the target gene expression was evident. CHIP-qPCR performed in both MCF-7 and MDA-MDA-231 confirmed the in-vivo binding of EZH2 on its identified target. Thirty invasive breast carcinoma cases with their adjacent normal tissues were included in the study. Immunohistochemistry in primary breast tumor tissue array showed tumor dependent expression of EZH2. Array of MERAV expression database revealed the strength of association of EZH2 with its target genes. Real time PCR performed with RNA extracted from breast tumor tissues further authenticated the existing negative correlation between EZH2 and its target genes. Pearson correlation coefficient & statistical significance computed using the matrix provided in the database strengthened the negative correlation between identified target genes and EZH2. KM plotter analysis showed improved relapse-free survival with increased expression of PMEPA1, POMT2, VGLL4 and SUMF1 in breast cancer patients indicating their therapeutic potential. While investigating the relevance of these target genes, different mutations of them were found in breast cancer patients. Seeking the clinical relevance of our study, following our recent publication that reports the role of EZH2 in nicotine-mediated breast cancer development and progression, we observed significant reduced expression of SUMF1 in breast cancer patient samples with smoking history in comparison to never-smoked patient samples. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we report that TOP1MT is overexpressed in cancer tissues and demonstrate that TOP1MT deficiency attenuates tumor growth in human and mouse models of colon and liver cancer. Due to their mitochondrial dysfunction, TOP1MT-KO cells become addicted to glycolysis, which limits synthetic building blocks and energy supply required for the proliferation of cancer cells in a nutrient-deprived tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, we show that TOP1MT associates with mitoribosomal subunits, ensuring optimal mitochondrial translation and assembly of oxidative phosphorylation complexes that are critical for sustaining tumor growth. The TOP1MT genomic signature profile, based on Top1mt-KO liver cancers, is correlated with enhanced survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Our results highlight the importance of TOP1MT for tumor development, providing a potential rationale to develop TOP1MT-targeted drugs as anticancer therapies. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

A new data integrative approach, based on graphical models, was applied on our multi-modal –omics, and clinical data cohort of metastatic melanoma patients. We found that response to chemotherapy is directly linked to ten gene expression, four methylation variables and PARP1 SNP rs1805407. PARP1 is a DNA repair gene critical for chemotherapy response and for which FDA-approved inhibitors are clinically available (olaparib). We demonstrated that two PARP inhibitors (ABT-888 and olaparib) make SNP carrier cancer cells of various histologic subtypes more sensitive to alkylating agents, but they have no effect in wild-type cells. Furthermore, PARP1 inhibitors act synergistically with chemotherapy in SNP carrier cells (especially in ovarian cancer for which olaparib is FDA-approved), but they are additive at best in wild-type cancer cells. Taken together, our results suggest that the combination of chemotherapy and PARP1 inhibition may benefit the carriers of rs1805407 in the future and may be used in personalized therapy strategies to select patients that are more likely to respond to PARP inhibitors. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Cancer remains one of the biggest threats to human society. There are massive demands for compounds to selectively kill cancerous cells. Earlier studies have shown that bovine α -lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells (BAMLET) becomes cytotoxic against cancer cells in complex with oleic acid {Hoque, M. et. al., PLoSOne8, e68390 (2013)}. In our study, we obtained bovine α-lactalbumin complexed with lanthanum ion (La 3+ -B-α-LA) and determined its high resolution crystal structure. The natural calcium binding site of bovine α-lactalbumin is replaced by lanthanum. The La 3+ complex formation by B-α-apo-LA was also supported by various biophysical methods. Interestingly, our complex, La 3+ -B-α-LA exhibits much greater anticancer activity against breast cancer cells as compared to the reported BAMLET-oleic acid complex. This study shows that La 3+ -B-α-LA complex is preferentially more toxic to MCF-7 cells as compared to KB (oral cancer) and HeLa (cervical) cells, while almost non-toxic to the healthy cells that we studied. Our data indicates that the cytotoxicity of La 3+ -B-α-LA against cancer cells is through apoptotic path way. The higher anticancer activity of La 3+ -B-α-LA is attributable to the requisite structural changes induced in the protein by La 3+ binding as supported by the crystal structure of the complex. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

However, no studies have evaluated vascular pain in patients with colorectal cancer in relation to peripheral venous administration of chemotherapy with or without oxaliplatin. We evaluated oxaliplatin-induced vascular pain using subjective and objective methods. We determined if oxaliplatin induced vascular pain in patients with colorectal cancer using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and a PainVision PS-2100 device. We compared VAS score between chemotherapy regimens with or without oxaliplatin, and between genders. We also examined the correlations of VAS score with pain intensity examined by the PainVision PS-2100, and with age and vessel diameter. A total of 98 patients with colorectal cancer were enrolled in this study, including 78 patients who received oxaliplatin via peripheral venous administration and 20 who received chemotherapy without oxaliplatin. The median VAS scores in patients with and without oxaliplatin were 36.5 (interquartile range 9.0–60.0) and 0 (0–4.0), respectively (P < 0.001), and the median pain intensities according to PainVision were 43.5 (14.3–98) and 36.5 (9.3–58.5), respectively (P < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between VAS and pain intensity (r = 0.584), but no correlation between VAS score and age (r = −0.174) or vessel diameter (r = −0.107).

One of the emerging techniques with tremendous power for lung cancer therapy is magnetic aerosol drug targeting (MADT). The use of a permanent magnet for effective drug delivery in a desired location throughout the lung requires extensive optimization, but it has not been addressed yet. In the present study, the possibility of using a permanent magnet for trapping the particles on a lung tumor is evaluated numerically in the Weibel's model from G0 to G3. The effect of different parameters is considered on the efficiency of particle deposition in a tumor located on a distant position of the lung bronchi and bronchioles. Also, the effective position of the magnetic source, tumor size, and location are the objectives for particle deposition. The results show that a limited particle deposition occurs on the lung branches in passive targeting. However, the incorporation of a permanent magnet next to the tumor enhanced the particle deposition fraction on G2 to up to 49% for the particles of 7 µm diameter. Optimizing the magnet size could also improve the particle deposition fraction by 68%. It was also shown that the utilization of MADT is essential for effective drug delivery to the tumors located on the lower wall of airway branches given the dominance of the air velocity and resultant drag force in this region. The results demonstrated the high competence and necessity of MADT as a noninvasive drug delivery method for lung cancer therapy." ;

Adjuvant chemotherapy has significantly reduced mortality but increased cognitive impairments, including attention function, making quality of life issues a crucial concern. This study enrolled nineteen breast cancer patients who were treated with standard chemotherapy within 6 months and 20 sex-matched healthy controls to investigate the brain effects of chemotherapy. All participants underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) with mean fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (mfALFF) analysis and were correlated with neuropsychological tests, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised (CAMS-R), and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), to explore the possible underlying mechanism of cognitive alternations. We found increased mfALFF over the frontoparietal lobe and decreased mfALFF over the occipital lobe in the cancer patients compared with the healthy controls; the altered brain regions may be associated with the dorsal attention network (DAN) and may be explained by a compensatory mechanism. Both MMSE and CAMS-R scores showed a positive correlation with mfALFF in the occipital lobe but a negative correlation in the frontoparietal lobe. By contrast, IES-R scores showed a positive correlation with mfALFF in the frontoparietal lobe but a negative correlation in the occipital lobe. These alterations are potentially related to the effects of both chemotherapy and psychological distress.

Mutations that occur in certain splicing factor genes themselves have been implicated in many cancers, particularly myelodysplastic syndromes. Small molecules that target splicing factors have been developed as therapies to preferentially induce apoptosis in these cancer cells.

There have been many attempts to identify markers and key pathways induced throughout EMT but the process is complex and depends on the cancer type and tumour microenvironment. Here we used the colon cancer cell line HT29, which stably overexpressed Snail, the key transcription factor in early EMT, as a model for colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with a pro-metastatic phenotype. We investigated miRNA expression regulation during that phenotypic switching. We found that overexpression of Snail in HT29 cells triggered significant changes in individual miRNA levels but did not change the global efficiency of miRNA processing. Snail abundance repressed the expression of miR-192 and miR-194 and increased miR-205, let-7i and SNORD13 levels. These identified changes correlated with the reported transcriptomic alterations in Snail-overexpressing HT29 cells. We also investigated how Snail affected the miRNA content of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from HT29 cells.

        fabio:abstract    "Solid malignancies are associated with the development of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP). This study aimed to evaluate the risk factors for PJP among patients with lung cancer. This retrospective case-control study compared patients who had lung cancer with PJP (n = 112) or without PJP (n = 336) matched according to age, sex, histopathology, and stage. PJP definition was based on (i) positive PCR or direct immunofluorescence results for pneumocystis, (ii) clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities that were consistent with a pneumonic process, and (iii) received targeted PJP treatment. The development of PJP was associated with radiotherapy (RTx), concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRTx), lymphopenia, and prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (20 mg of prednisolone equivalent per day for ≥3 weeks). Multivariate analysis revealed independent associations with prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06–3.63; p = 0.032) and CCRTx (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.27–3.43; p = 0.004). Steroid use was frequently related to RTx pneumonitis or esophagitis (29 patients, 43.3%). Prolonged high-dose steroid therapy and CCRTx were risk factors for PJP development among patients with lung cancer. As these patients had a poor prognosis, clinicians should consider PJP prophylaxis for high-risk patients with lung cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we compared The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) breast cancer genomic datasets (array and next generation sequencing (NGS) data) in detecting genomic alterations in clinically relevant genes. We performed an in silico analysis to determine the concordance in the frequencies of actionable mutations and copy number alterations/aberrations (CNAs) in the two most common breast cancer histologies, invasive lobular and invasive ductal carcinoma. We found that targeted sequencing identified a larger number of mutational hotspots and clinically significant amplifications that would have been missed by WES and SNP arrays in many actionable genes such as PIK3CA, EGFR, AKT3, FGFR1, ERBB2, ERBB3 and ESR1. The striking differences between the number of mutational hotspots and CNAs generated from these platforms highlight a number of factors that should be considered in the interpretation of array and NGS-based genomic data for precision medicine. Targeted panel sequencing was preferable to WES to define the full spectrum of somatic mutations present in a tumor. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Several oxaliplatin transporters were previously identified but their relative contributions to determining oxaliplatin tumour responses and gastrointestinal tumour cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin remains unclear. We studied clinical associations between tumour expression of oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes and patient response to oxaliplatin, then experimentally verified associations found with MRP2 in models of human gastrointestinal cancer. Among 18 oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes, MRP2 was the only one to be differentially expressed in the tumours of colorectal cancer patients who did or did not respond to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Over-expression of MRP2 (endogenously in HepG2 and PANC-1 cells, or induced by stable transfection of HEK293 cells) decreased oxaliplatin accumulation and cytotoxicity but those deficits were reversed by inhibition of MRP2 with myricetin or siRNA knockdown. Mice bearing subcutaneous HepG2 tumour xenografts were sensitised to oxaliplatin antitumour activity by concurrent myricetin treatment with little or no increase in toxicity. In conclusion, MRP2 limits oxaliplatin accumulation and response in human gastrointestinal cancer. Screening tumour MRP2 expression levels, to select patients for treatment with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy alone or in combination with a MRP2 inhibitor, could improve treatment outcomes. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

We compare optimized gene signatures for cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin responses in the same cell lines and validate each signature using data from patients with cancer. Supervised support vector machine learning is used to derive gene sets whose expression is related to the cell line GI50 values by backwards feature selection with cross-validation. Specific genes and functional pathways distinguishing sensitive from resistant cell lines are identified by contrasting signatures obtained at extreme and median GI50 thresholds. Ensembles of gene signatures at different thresholds are combined to reduce the dependence on specific GI50 values for predicting drug responses. The most accurate gene signatures for each platin are: cisplatin: BARD1, BCL2, BCL2L1, CDKN2C, FAAP24, FEN1, MAP3K1, MAPK13, MAPK3, NFKB1, NFKB2, SLC22A5, SLC31A2, TLR4, and TWIST1; carboplatin: AKT1, EIF3K, ERCC1, GNGT1, GSR, MTHFR, NEDD4L, NLRP1, NRAS, RAF1, SGK1, TIGD1, TP53, VEGFB, and VEGFC; and oxaliplatin: BRAF, FCGR2A, IGF1, MSH2, NAGK, NFE2L2, NQO1, PANK3, SLC47A1, SLCO1B1, and UGT1A1. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with bladder, ovarian, and colorectal cancer were used to test the cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin signatures, resulting in 71.0%, 60.2%, and 54.5% accuracies in predicting disease recurrence and 59%, 61%, and 72% accuracies in predicting remission, respectively. One cisplatin signature predicted 100% of recurrence in non-smoking patients with bladder cancer (57% disease-free; N = 19), and 79% recurrence in smokers (62% disease-free; N = 35).

MTH1 dephosphorylates oxidized nucleotides, thereby preventing their incorporation into DNA and protecting tumour cells from oxidative DNA damage. Inhibitors of MTH1 (TH588 and (S)-crizotinib) were shown to reduce cancer cell viability. However, the MTH1-dependency of the anti-cancer effects of these drugs has recently been questioned. Here, we have assessed anti-tumour effects of TH588 and (S)-crizotinib in patient-derived 3D colorectal cancer cultures. Hypoxia and reoxygenation – conditions that increase intracellular ROS levels – increased sensitivity to (S)-crizotinib, but not to TH588. (S)-crizotinib reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-MET and ErbB3 whereas TH588 induced a mitotic cell cycle arrest, which was not affected by adding ROS-modulating compounds. Furthermore, we show that both compounds induced DNA damage that could not be prevented by adding the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Moreover, adding ROS-modulating compounds did not alter the reduction in viability in response to TH588 and (S)-crizotinib. We conclude that TH588 and (S)-crizotinib have very clear and distinct anti-tumour effects in 3D colorectal cancer cultures, but that these effects most likely occur through distinct and ROS-independent mechanisms. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Histological iron imaging and contrast-agent free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect these deposits, but their presence in human cancer, and correlation with immunotherapeutic response is largely untested. Here, primarily using these iron imaging approaches, we evaluated the spatial distribution of polarized macrophage populations containing high endogenous levels of iron in preclinical murine models and human breast cancer, and used them as metabolic biomarkers to correlate TAM infiltration with response to immunotherapy in preclinical trials. Macrophage-targeted inhibition of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) by immunotherapy was confirmed to inhibit macrophage accumulation and slow mammary tumor growth in mouse models while also reducing hemosiderin iron-laden TAM accumulation as measured by both iron histology and in vivo iron MRI (FeMRI). Spatial profiling of TAM iron deposit infiltration defined regions of maximal accumulation and response to the CSF1R inhibitor, and revealed differences between microenvironments of human cancer according to levels of polarized macrophage iron accumulation in stromal margins. We therefore demonstrate that iron deposition serves as an endogenous metabolic imaging biomarker of TAM infiltration in breast cancer that has high translational potential for evaluation of immunotherapeutic response. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

The AP2 family also acts as a tumor suppressor. Here we found that p73 and AP2 are able to activate NEU4, a neuraminidase gene, which removes the terminal sialic acid residues from cancer-associated glycans. Under serum starvation, NEU4 was up-regulated and one of the NEU4 target glycans, sialyl Lewis X, was decreased, whereas p73 and AP2 were up-regulated. Sialyl Lewis X levels were not, however, decreased under starvation conditions in p73- or AP2-knockdown cells. p53 and AP2 underwent protein-protein interactions, exerting synergistic effects to activate p21, and interaction of p53 with AP2 was lost in cells expressing the L350P mutation of p53. The homologous residues in p63 and p73 are L423 and L377, respectively. The synergistic effect of p53/p63 with AP2 to activate genes was lost with the L350P/L423P mutation in p53/p63, but p73 bearing the L377P mutation was able to interact with AP2 and exerted its normal synergistic effects. We propose that p73 and AP2 synergistically activate the NEU4 promoter in colon cancer cells. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Treatment with increasing concentrations of HspNPs (25, 50, 75 and 100 µg/mL) resulted in 9.1-, 7-, 12.5- and 12.7-fold in increase in apoptotic cell number. Optimum doses of Hsp and HspNPs were found to increase oxidative damage in C6 glioma cells. MDA levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were found to be significantly elevated at 75 and 100 µg/mL exposure concentration of HspNPs with (p = .002) and (p = .018), respectively for 48-h treatment.

GO exhibits pH-dependent fluorescence emission in the visible/near-infrared, providing a possibility of molecular imaging and pH-sensing. It is also water soluble and has a substantial platform for functionalization, allowing for the delivery of multiple therapeutics. GO physical properties are modified to enhance cellular internalization, producing fluorescent nanoflakes with low (<15%) cytotoxicity at the imaging concentrations of 15 μg/mL. As a result, at lower flake sizes GO rapidly internalizes into HeLa cells with the following 70% fluorescence based clearance at 24 h, assessed by its characteristic emission in red/near-IR. pH-dependence of GO emission is utilized to provide the sensing of acidic extracellular environments of cancer cells. The results demonstrate diminishing green/red (550/630 nm) fluorescence intensity ratios for HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells in comparison to HEK-293 healthy cells suggesting a potential use of GO as a non-invasive optical sensor for cancer microenvironments.

        fabio:abstract    "Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells, represents early stages of metastasis and is a promising target in colorectal cancer (CRC) therapy. There have been many attempts to identify markers and key pathways induced throughout EMT but the process is complex and depends on the cancer type and tumour microenvironment. Here we used the colon cancer cell line HT29, which stably overexpressed Snail, the key transcription factor in early EMT, as a model for colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with a pro-metastatic phenotype. We investigated miRNA expression regulation during that phenotypic switching. We found that overexpression of Snail in HT29 cells triggered significant changes in individual miRNA levels but did not change the global efficiency of miRNA processing. Snail abundance repressed the expression of miR-192 and miR-194 and increased miR-205, let-7i and SNORD13 levels. These identified changes correlated with the reported transcriptomic alterations in Snail-overexpressing HT29 cells. We also investigated how Snail affected the miRNA content of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from HT29 cells. Our data suggest that the presence of Snail significantly alters the complex mRNA/miRNA interactions in the early steps of metastasis and also has an impact on the content of EVs released from HT29 cells. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Solid malignancies are associated with the development of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP). This study aimed to evaluate the risk factors for PJP among patients with lung cancer. This retrospective case-control study compared patients who had lung cancer with PJP (n = 112) or without PJP (n = 336) matched according to age, sex, histopathology, and stage. PJP definition was based on (i) positive PCR or direct immunofluorescence results for pneumocystis, (ii) clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities that were consistent with a pneumonic process, and (iii) received targeted PJP treatment. The development of PJP was associated with radiotherapy (RTx), concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRTx), lymphopenia, and prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (20 mg of prednisolone equivalent per day for ≥3 weeks). Multivariate analysis revealed independent associations with prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06–3.63; p = 0.032) and CCRTx (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.27–3.43; p = 0.004). Steroid use was frequently related to RTx pneumonitis or esophagitis (29 patients, 43.3%). Prolonged high-dose steroid therapy and CCRTx were risk factors for PJP development among patients with lung cancer. As these patients had a poor prognosis, clinicians should consider PJP prophylaxis for high-risk patients with lung cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we compared The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) breast cancer genomic datasets (array and next generation sequencing (NGS) data) in detecting genomic alterations in clinically relevant genes. We performed an in silico analysis to determine the concordance in the frequencies of actionable mutations and copy number alterations/aberrations (CNAs) in the two most common breast cancer histologies, invasive lobular and invasive ductal carcinoma. We found that targeted sequencing identified a larger number of mutational hotspots and clinically significant amplifications that would have been missed by WES and SNP arrays in many actionable genes such as PIK3CA, EGFR, AKT3, FGFR1, ERBB2, ERBB3 and ESR1. The striking differences between the number of mutational hotspots and CNAs generated from these platforms highlight a number of factors that should be considered in the interpretation of array and NGS-based genomic data for precision medicine. Targeted panel sequencing was preferable to WES to define the full spectrum of somatic mutations present in a tumor. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Several oxaliplatin transporters were previously identified but their relative contributions to determining oxaliplatin tumour responses and gastrointestinal tumour cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin remains unclear. We studied clinical associations between tumour expression of oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes and patient response to oxaliplatin, then experimentally verified associations found with MRP2 in models of human gastrointestinal cancer. Among 18 oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes, MRP2 was the only one to be differentially expressed in the tumours of colorectal cancer patients who did or did not respond to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Over-expression of MRP2 (endogenously in HepG2 and PANC-1 cells, or induced by stable transfection of HEK293 cells) decreased oxaliplatin accumulation and cytotoxicity but those deficits were reversed by inhibition of MRP2 with myricetin or siRNA knockdown. Mice bearing subcutaneous HepG2 tumour xenografts were sensitised to oxaliplatin antitumour activity by concurrent myricetin treatment with little or no increase in toxicity. In conclusion, MRP2 limits oxaliplatin accumulation and response in human gastrointestinal cancer. Screening tumour MRP2 expression levels, to select patients for treatment with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy alone or in combination with a MRP2 inhibitor, could improve treatment outcomes. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

We compare optimized gene signatures for cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin responses in the same cell lines and validate each signature using data from patients with cancer. Supervised support vector machine learning is used to derive gene sets whose expression is related to the cell line GI50 values by backwards feature selection with cross-validation. Specific genes and functional pathways distinguishing sensitive from resistant cell lines are identified by contrasting signatures obtained at extreme and median GI50 thresholds. Ensembles of gene signatures at different thresholds are combined to reduce the dependence on specific GI50 values for predicting drug responses. The most accurate gene signatures for each platin are: cisplatin: BARD1, BCL2, BCL2L1, CDKN2C, FAAP24, FEN1, MAP3K1, MAPK13, MAPK3, NFKB1, NFKB2, SLC22A5, SLC31A2, TLR4, and TWIST1; carboplatin: AKT1, EIF3K, ERCC1, GNGT1, GSR, MTHFR, NEDD4L, NLRP1, NRAS, RAF1, SGK1, TIGD1, TP53, VEGFB, and VEGFC; and oxaliplatin: BRAF, FCGR2A, IGF1, MSH2, NAGK, NFE2L2, NQO1, PANK3, SLC47A1, SLCO1B1, and UGT1A1. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with bladder, ovarian, and colorectal cancer were used to test the cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin signatures, resulting in 71.0%, 60.2%, and 54.5% accuracies in predicting disease recurrence and 59%, 61%, and 72% accuracies in predicting remission, respectively. One cisplatin signature predicted 100% of recurrence in non-smoking patients with bladder cancer (57% disease-free; N = 19), and 79% recurrence in smokers (62% disease-free; N = 35).

MTH1 dephosphorylates oxidized nucleotides, thereby preventing their incorporation into DNA and protecting tumour cells from oxidative DNA damage. Inhibitors of MTH1 (TH588 and (S)-crizotinib) were shown to reduce cancer cell viability. However, the MTH1-dependency of the anti-cancer effects of these drugs has recently been questioned. Here, we have assessed anti-tumour effects of TH588 and (S)-crizotinib in patient-derived 3D colorectal cancer cultures. Hypoxia and reoxygenation – conditions that increase intracellular ROS levels – increased sensitivity to (S)-crizotinib, but not to TH588. (S)-crizotinib reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-MET and ErbB3 whereas TH588 induced a mitotic cell cycle arrest, which was not affected by adding ROS-modulating compounds. Furthermore, we show that both compounds induced DNA damage that could not be prevented by adding the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Moreover, adding ROS-modulating compounds did not alter the reduction in viability in response to TH588 and (S)-crizotinib. We conclude that TH588 and (S)-crizotinib have very clear and distinct anti-tumour effects in 3D colorectal cancer cultures, but that these effects most likely occur through distinct and ROS-independent mechanisms. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Histological iron imaging and contrast-agent free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect these deposits, but their presence in human cancer, and correlation with immunotherapeutic response is largely untested. Here, primarily using these iron imaging approaches, we evaluated the spatial distribution of polarized macrophage populations containing high endogenous levels of iron in preclinical murine models and human breast cancer, and used them as metabolic biomarkers to correlate TAM infiltration with response to immunotherapy in preclinical trials. Macrophage-targeted inhibition of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) by immunotherapy was confirmed to inhibit macrophage accumulation and slow mammary tumor growth in mouse models while also reducing hemosiderin iron-laden TAM accumulation as measured by both iron histology and in vivo iron MRI (FeMRI). Spatial profiling of TAM iron deposit infiltration defined regions of maximal accumulation and response to the CSF1R inhibitor, and revealed differences between microenvironments of human cancer according to levels of polarized macrophage iron accumulation in stromal margins. We therefore demonstrate that iron deposition serves as an endogenous metabolic imaging biomarker of TAM infiltration in breast cancer that has high translational potential for evaluation of immunotherapeutic response. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

The AP2 family also acts as a tumor suppressor. Here we found that p73 and AP2 are able to activate NEU4, a neuraminidase gene, which removes the terminal sialic acid residues from cancer-associated glycans. Under serum starvation, NEU4 was up-regulated and one of the NEU4 target glycans, sialyl Lewis X, was decreased, whereas p73 and AP2 were up-regulated. Sialyl Lewis X levels were not, however, decreased under starvation conditions in p73- or AP2-knockdown cells. p53 and AP2 underwent protein-protein interactions, exerting synergistic effects to activate p21, and interaction of p53 with AP2 was lost in cells expressing the L350P mutation of p53. The homologous residues in p63 and p73 are L423 and L377, respectively. The synergistic effect of p53/p63 with AP2 to activate genes was lost with the L350P/L423P mutation in p53/p63, but p73 bearing the L377P mutation was able to interact with AP2 and exerted its normal synergistic effects. We propose that p73 and AP2 synergistically activate the NEU4 promoter in colon cancer cells. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Treatment of C6 glioma cells with HspNPs for 24 and 48 h resulted in dose- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability, with approximate IC50 of 28 and 21 μg/mL, respectively (p = .036 for 24 h, p = .025 for 48 h). The percentage of PCNA positive cells decreased to 20% and 10%, respectively, for Hsp- and HspNP-treated cells at concentration of 100 µg/mL. Treatment with increasing concentrations of HspNPs (25, 50, 75 and 100 µg/mL) resulted in 9.1-, 7-, 12.5- and 12.7-fold in increase in apoptotic cell number. Optimum doses of Hsp and HspNPs were found to increase oxidative damage in C6 glioma cells. MDA levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were found to be significantly elevated at 75 and 100 µg/mL exposure concentration of HspNPs with (p = .002) and (p = .018), respectively for 48-h treatment.

GO exhibits pH-dependent fluorescence emission in the visible/near-infrared, providing a possibility of molecular imaging and pH-sensing. It is also water soluble and has a substantial platform for functionalization, allowing for the delivery of multiple therapeutics. GO physical properties are modified to enhance cellular internalization, producing fluorescent nanoflakes with low (<15%) cytotoxicity at the imaging concentrations of 15 μg/mL. As a result, at lower flake sizes GO rapidly internalizes into HeLa cells with the following 70% fluorescence based clearance at 24 h, assessed by its characteristic emission in red/near-IR. pH-dependence of GO emission is utilized to provide the sensing of acidic extracellular environments of cancer cells. The results demonstrate diminishing green/red (550/630 nm) fluorescence intensity ratios for HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells in comparison to HEK-293 healthy cells suggesting a potential use of GO as a non-invasive optical sensor for cancer microenvironments.

A total of 19,785 newly diagnosed CC patients were registered during 2010–2016, among them only 16,946 (85.6%) with primary CC tumor. There was no difference in treatment modality between DM and non-DM patients. However intergroup assessment showed that type 2DM have significantly higher rate of mortality in both overall mortality (28.3%) and CC-specific (11.7%) as compared to Type 1DM (17.3%; 5.5%) and non DM patients (12.7%; 9.1%) (p < 0.001). Within group assessments showed that Type 2DM patients have better quality of life (mean 7.13 ± 3.67) (p < 0.001) and less distress levels (mean 2.41 ± 0.63) (p < 0.011) as compared to type1 DM (meant 10.54 ± 2.11; 3.19 ± 1.07). This study concluded that T2DM prognostic effect still remained after adjusting demographic and clinical parameters. Type 1 diabetes mellitus showed better OS and CSS then type2 DM. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Despite the widening range of high-throughput platforms and exponential growth of generated data volume, the validation of biomarkers discovered from large-scale data remains a challenging field. In order to tackle cancer heterogeneity and comply with the data dimensionality, a number of network and pathway approaches were invented but rarely systematically applied to this task. We propose a new method, called NEAmarker, for finding sensitive and robust biomarkers at the pathway level. scores from network enrichment analysis transform the original space of altered genes into a lower-dimensional space of pathways. These dimensions are then correlated with phenotype variables. The method was first tested using in vitro data from three anti-cancer drug screens and then on clinical data of The Cancer Genome Atlas. It proved superior to the single-gene and alternative enrichment analyses in terms of (1) universal applicability to different data types with a possibility of cross-platform integration, (2) consistency of the discovered correlates between independent drug screens, and (3) ability to explain differential survival of treated patients. Our new screen of anti-cancer compounds validated the performance of multivariate models of drug sensitivity. The previously proposed methods of enrichment analysis could achieve comparable levels of performance in certain tests. However, only our method could discover predictors of both in vitro response and patient survival given administration of the same drug. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

SPIONs entrapped in the core of the nanocomplex may act as a hyperthermia agent and generate localized heat upon excitation with an alternating magnetic field (AMF), thus enabling a thermo-chemotherapy strategy for cancer treatment. Accordingly, the cytotoxic effect and the mode of cell death triggered by the nanocomplex in combination with AMF were evaluated on two different cancer cell lines with various folate receptor (FR) expression levels, including KB nasopharyngeal cancer cells overexpressing FRs as the model and MCF-7 breast cancer cells with low level of FRs as the blank sample. The obtained results showed that KB cell death was greater than the cell death observed in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, a majority of cell death in both cell lines were related to apoptosis when the folate-modified nanocomplex was used instated of the non-folate-modified nanocomplex. Therefore, functionalizing the nanocomplex with folate modulated the response to thermo-chemotherapy by shifting the cell death pathways toward apoptosis." ;

We examined TILs grades of pretreatment cancer tissue specimens and residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab and determined the predictive utility of the TILs grade in pathological complete response (pCR) and the prognostic power of TILs in HER2-positive breast cancer. This cohort study included 128 HER2-positive breast cancer who received NAC with trastuzumab. TILs grading of the tumor stroma in pretreatment biopsy specimens and residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab was categorized as low, intermediate, and high based on the criteria of the International Working Group. In current study, the pCR rate was 64.8%, and the Relapse-free survival (RFS) was significantly worse in the non-pCR group than in the pCR group. The pCR rate correlated with the TILs grade in pretreatment tumors. In 45 non-pCR patients, TILs grade was higher in the residual tumors than in the pretreatment tumors. The RFS was significantly better in residual tumors with high TILs grade than those with low TILs grade (p = 0.033). In conclusion, assessment of the TILs grade in residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab might be necessary to determine patients with good prognosis among those who do not achieve pCR. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

However, their clinical importance in gallbladder cancer has rarely been explored. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of surgical intervention and the effectiveness of preoperative test on neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) for predicting the prognosis in gallbladder cancer patients. In this study, a total of 255 gallbladder cancer patients were retrospectively selected. For each patient, we recorded his/her treatment algorithm (with or without surgery) and their preoperative inflammatory biomarkers, as well as their detailed survival information for 5 years. A total of 216 patients received surgical intervention and the other 39 chose conservative treatment. The median survival time was 4.6 months for non-surgical group (P < 0.001), and 12.2 months for surgical intervention group. Among the surgical group, ROC analysis showed the AUC of NLR, PLR and MLR were 0.675 (95% CI: 0.600 to 0.751, P < 0.001), 0.599 (95% CI: 0.520 to 0.677, P = 0.017) and 0.607 (95% CI: 0.529 to 0.686, P = 0.009), respectively.

        fabio:abstract    "Most targeting strategies of anticancer drug delivery systems (DDSs) rely on the surface functionalization of nanocarriers with specific ligands, which trigger the internalization in cancer cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The endocytosis implies the entrapment of DDSs in acidic vesicles (endosomes and lysosomes) and their eventual ejection by exocytosis. This process, intrinsic to eukaryotic cells, is one of the main drawbacks of DDSs because it reduces the drug bioavailability in the intracellular environment. The escape of DDSs from the acidic vesicles is, therefore, crucial to enhance the therapeutic performance at low drug dose. To this end, we developed a multifunctionalized DDS that combines high specificity towards cancer cells with endosomal escape capabilities. Doxorubicin-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles were functionalized with polyethylenimine, a polymer commonly used to induce endosomal rupture, and hyaluronic acid, which binds to CD44 receptors, overexpressed in cancer cells. We show irrefutable proof that the developed DDS can escape the endosomal pathway upon polymeric functionalization. Interestingly, the combination of the two polymers resulted in higher endosomal escape efficiency than the polyethylenimine coating alone. Hyaluronic acid additionally provides the system with cancer targeting capability and enzymatically controlled drug release. Thanks to this multifunctionality, the engineered DDS had cytotoxicity comparable to the pure drug whilst displaying high specificity towards cancer cells. The polymeric engineering here developed enhances the performance of DDS at low drug dose, holding great potential for anticancer therapeutic applications. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Using multiple aggressive murine models of triple-negative breast cancer, we have recently demonstrated that the early administration of oncolytic Maraba virus (MRB) prior to surgical resection of the primary tumor is sufficient to minimize the metastatic burden, protect against tumor rechallenge, cure a fraction of the mice and sensitize refractory tumors to immune checkpoint blockade without the need for further treatment. Here, we apply our surgical model to other OVs: Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Adenovirus (Ad), Reovirus (Reo) and Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and show that all of the tested OVs could positively change the outcome of the treated animals. The growth of the primary and secondary tumors was differently affected by the various OVs and most of the viruses conferred survival benefits in this neoadjuvant setting despite the absence of direct treatment following rechallenge.

Recent data indicate that p130Cas association to ErbB2 protects ErbB2 from degradation, thus enhancing tumorigenesis. Therefore, inhibiting p130Cas/ErbB2 interaction might represent a new therapeutic strategy to target breast cancer. Here we demonstrate by performing Molecular Modeling, Molecular Dynamics, dot blot, ELISA and fluorescence quenching experiments, that p130Cas binds directly to ErbB2. Then, by structure-based virtual screening, we identified two potential inhibitors of p130Cas/ErbB2 interaction. Their experimental validation was performed in vitro and in ErbB2-positive breast cancer cellular models. The results highlight that both compounds interfere with p130Cas/ErbB2 binding and significantly affect cell proliferation and sensitivity to Trastuzumab. Overall, this study identifies p130Cas/ErbB2 complex as a potential breast cancer target revealing new therapeutic perspectives for protein-protein interaction (PPI). © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

A large number of clinical applications have revealed that Trametes robiniophila Μurr. (Huaier) exhibits an anti-tumour effect. However, loss of the bioactive components of Huaier during the extraction procedure with water is unavoidable, and the underlying mechanism of the anti-cancer effect of Huaier remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer effect of Huaier n-butanol extract, which contained 51.4% total flavonoids, on HGC27, MGC803, and AGS human GC cell lines in vitro. At a low concentration, Huaier n-butanol extract inhibited the growth of these GC cell types, induced cell cycle arrest and reduced cell metastasis. Moreover, Huaier n-butanol extract suppressed the c-Myc-Bmi1 signalling pathway, and overexpression of Bmi1 reversed the effects of Huaier n-butanol extract on GC cells. Thus, our findings indicate that Huaier n-butanol extract suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of GC cells via a c-Myc-Bmi1-mediated approach, providing a new perspective for our understanding of the anti-tumour effects of Huaier. These results suggest that Huaier n-butanol extract could be an attractive therapeutic adjuvant for the treatment of human GC. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

In the present study, we screened the anticancer potential of supernatant metabolites from eight native haloarchaeal strains obtained from a culture collection in Iran. Five human cancer cell lines including breast, lung, prostate and also human fibroblast cells as the normal control were used in the present study. Moreover, to evaluate the anti-tumor effect of the selected supernatant, inhibition of sphere formation and tumor development was assessed in-vitro and in-vivo, respectively. Among all strains, supernatant metabolites from Halobacterium salinarum IBRC M10715 had the most potent cytotoxic effect on prostate cancer cell lines (IC50 = 0.5 mg/mL) without any effects on normal cells. It significantly increased both early and late apoptosis (about 11% and 9%, respectively) in the androgen-dependent PC3 cell line, reduced sphere formation ability of DU145 and PC3 cells with down-regulation of SOX2 gene expression. Furthermore, our results revealed that tumors developed in nude mice significantly shrank post intratumor injection of metabolites of the haloarchaeal strain. In conclusion, we suggested here for the first time that supernatant metabolites from Halobacterium salinarum IBRC M10715 could be a novel component against prostate cancer in-vitro and in-vivo with remarkable reduction in stem-like properties of tumor. © 2018, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

The main HNSCC risk factors are tobacco, excessive alcohol use, and the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV positive (+) cancers are etiologically different from other HNSCC and often show better prognosis. The current knowledge regarding HNSCC miRNA profiles is still incomplete especially in the context of HPV+ cancer. Thus, we analyzed 61 freshly collected primary oral (OSCC) and oropharyngeal (OPSCC) SCC samples. HPV DNA and RNA was found in 21% cases. The Illumina whole-genome small-RNA profiling by next-generation sequencing was done on 22 samples and revealed 7 specific miRNAs to HPV+ OSCC, 77 to HPV+ OPSCC, and additional 3 shared with both; 51 miRNAs were specific to HPV− OPSCC, 62 to HPV− OSCC, and 31 shared with both. The results for 9 miRNAs (miR-9, -21, -29a, -100, -106b, -143 and -145) were assessed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction on the whole study population. The data was additionally confirmed by reanalyzing publicly available miRNA sequencing Cancer Genome Atlas consortium (TCGA) HNSCC data. Cell signaling pathway analysis revealed differences between HPV+ and HPV− HNSCC. Our findings compared with literature data revealed extensive heterogeneity of miRNA deregulation with only several miRNAs consistently affected, and miR-9 being the most likely HPV related miRNA. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Resistance to 5-Fluorouracil chemotherapy is a major cause of therapeutic failure in colon cancer cure. Development of combined therapies constitutes an effective strategy to inhibit cancer cells and prevent the emergence of drug resistance. For this purpose, we investigated the anti-tumoral effect of thirteen phenolic compounds, from the Tunisian quince Cydonia oblonga Miller, alone or combined to 5-FU, on the human 5-FU-resistant LS174-R colon cancer cells in comparison to parental cells. Our results showed that only Kaempferol was able to chemo-sensitize 5-FU-resistant LS174-R cells. This phenolic compound combined with 5-FU exerted synergistic inhibitory effect on cell viability. This combination enhanced the apoptosis and induced cell cycle arrest of both chemo-resistant and sensitive cells through impacting the expression levels of different cellular effectors. Kaempferol also blocked the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and modulated the expression of JAK/STAT3, MAPK, PI3K/AKT and NF-κB. In silico docking analysis suggested that the potent anti-tumoral effect of Kaempferol, compared to its two analogs (Kaempferol 3-O-glucoside and Kampferol 3-O-rutinoside), can be explained by the absence of glucosyl groups. Overall, our data propose Kaempferol as a potential chemotherapeutic agent to be used alone or in combination with 5-FU to overcome colon cancer drug resistance. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Considering the high prevalence and mortality rate of colorectal cancer, in this study we tried to design and validate a standard printed form and evaluate oncologists’ and nurses’ adherence to this form. This cross-sectional study was performed in Omid hospital, Mashhad, Iran from January 2015 to October 2015. A Chemotherapy form including various demographic and clinical parameters and approved chemotherapy regimens for colorectal cancer was designed by the clinical pharmacist and validated by clinical oncologists working in this center. All eligible patients admitted in this center during this period of time were included in the study. Adherence of the oncologists and nurses to this form and probable medication errors were identified by the pharmacy student. Sixty-seven patients with colorectal cancer and a total of 251 chemotherapy courses were evaluated. All patients received regimens compatible with developed form but in 206 courses (98.56%) of chemotherapy dosing error happened and in most of cases patients received lower than calculated dose (37.8%). Three errors occurred in administration step by nurses which they infused the medication in shorter than recommended duration. In general, oncologists’ adherence with developed form for chemotherapy of colorectal cancer was relatively high, except in dose calculation. Avoiding from rounding the calculated medications’ doses and precise calculation of patients’ body surface area can prevent most of medication errors and reduce risk of adverse drug reaction occurrence. © 2018, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

Nevertheless, the importance of transfusion timing is still unclear. The primary purpose of this study is to appraise whether the receipt of intraoperative blood transfusion (BT) differ from postoperative BT in regards to cancer outcomes in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients treated with nephrectomy. Data on 1168 patients with RCC, who underwent radical or partial nephrectomy as primary therapy between 1988–2013 were analyzed. PBT was defined as transfusion of allogeneic red blood cells (RBC) during surgery or the postsurgical period. Survival was analyzed and compared using the Kaplan–Meier method with the log-rank test. Of 1168 patients, 198 patients (16.9%) received a PBT. Including 117 intraoperative BT and 81 postoperative BT. Only 21 (10.6%) patients required both intraoperative and postoperative BT. On multivariate analyses, receipt of PBT was associated with significantly worse local disease recurrence (HR: 2.4; P = 0.017), metastatic progression (HR: 2.7; P = 0.005), cancer-specific mortality (HR: 3.5; P = 0.002) and all-cause mortality (HR: 2.1; P = 0.005). Nevertheless, postoperative BT was not independently associated with increased risk of local recurrence (p = 0.1), metastatic progression (P = 0.16) or kidney cancer death (P = 0.63), yet did significantly increase the risk of overall mortality (HR: 2.6; P = 0.004). In the current study, intraoperative transfusion of allogeneic RBC is associated with increased risks of cancer recurrence and mortality following nephrectomy. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

For this reason novel therapies accounting for PDAC peculiarities, such as the relevant stromal reaction, are urgently needed. Here adipose mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (AD-MSC) have been armed to constantly release a soluble trimeric and multimeric variant of the known anti-cancer TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (sTRAIL). This cancer gene therapy strategy was in vitro challenged demonstrating that sTRAIL was thermally stable and able to induce apoptosis in the PDAC lines BxPC-3, MIA PaCa-2 and against primary PDAC cells. sTRAIL released by AD-MSC relocated into the tumor stroma was able to significantly counteract tumor growth in vivo with a significant reduction in tumor size, in cytokeratin-7+ cells and by an anti-angiogenic effect. In parallel, histology on PDAC specimens form patients (n = 19) was performed to investigate the levels of TRAIL DR4, DR5 and OPG receptors generating promising insights on the possible clinical translation of our approach. These results indicate that adipose MSC can very efficiently vehicle a novel TRAIL variant opening unexplored opportunities for PDAC treatment. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Therefore, identification of novel therapeutic targets involved in melanoma progression is urgently needed for developing effective therapeutic methods. Overexpression of interleukin-13 receptor α2 (IL13Rα2) is observed in several cancer types including glioma and pancreatic cancer. Although IL13Rα2 is implicated in the progression of various types of cancer, its expression and roles in the malignant melanoma have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we showed that IL13Rα2 was expressed in approximately 7.5% melanoma patients. While IL13Rα2 expression in human melanoma cells decreased their proliferation in vitro, it promoted in vivo tumour growth and angiogenesis in melanoma xenograft mouse model. We also found that the expression of amphiregulin, a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, was correlated with IL13Rα2 expression in cultured melanoma cells, xenograft tumour tissues and melanoma clinical samples. Furthermore, expression of amphiregulin promoted tumour growth, implicating causal relationship between the expression of IL13Rα2 and amphiregulin. These results suggest that IL13Rα2 enhances tumorigenicity by inducing angiogenesis in malignant melanoma, and serves as a potential therapeutic target of malignant melanoma. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Experiment in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines demonstrated up-regulation of PKD2 led to high expression of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vim, mmp9 et al.) and EMT transcription factors(zeb1, twist, snail), and the results were reversed when PKD2 was knocked down. Further investigation showed that abrogation of PKD2 inhibited A549 cell migration, invasion, proliferation and induced cell arrest in G2/M phase.

We showed for the first time that Raman imaging can be used to distinguish successfully between glycosylated and nonglycosylated proteins in normal and cancer tissue. Thousands of protein, lipid and glycan species exist in cells and tissues and their metabolism is monitored via numerous pathways, networks and methods. The metabolism can change in response to cellular environment alterations, such as development of a disease. Measuring such alterations and understanding the pathways involved are crucial to fully understand cellular metabolism in cancer development. In this paper Raman markers of glycogen, glycosaminoglycan, chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate proteoglycan were identified based on their vibrational signatures. High spatial resolution of Raman imaging combined with chemometrics allows separation of individual species from many chemical components present in each cell. We have found that metabolism of proteins, lipids and glycans is markedly deregulated in breast (adenocarcinoma) and brain (medulloblastoma) tumors. We have identified two glycoforms in the normal breast tissue and the malignant brain tissue in contrast to the breast cancer tissue where only one glycoform has been identified. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate anti-cancer effects of NLC-Citral in MDA MB-231 cells in vitro through the Annexin V, cell cycle, JC-1 and fluorometric assays. Additionally, this study is aimed to effects of NLC-Citral in reducing the tumor weight and size in 4T1 induced murine breast cancer model. Results showed that NLC-Citral induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest in MDA MB-231 cells. Furthermore, a prominent anti-metastatic ability of NLC-Citral was demonstrated in vitro using scratch, migration and invasion assays. A significant reduction of migrated and invaded cells was observed in the NLC-Citral treated MDA MB-231 cells. To further evaluate the apoptotic and anti-metastatic mechanism of NLC-Citral at the molecular level, microarray-based gene expression and proteomic profiling were conducted. Based on the result obtained, NLC-Citral was found to regulate several important signaling pathways related to cancer development such as apoptosis, cell cycle, and metastasis signaling pathways. Additionally, gene expression analysis was validated through the targeted RNA sequencing and real-time polymerase chain reaction. In conclusion, the NLC-Citral inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells in vitro, majorly through the induction of apoptosis, anti-metastasis, anti-angiogenesis potentials, and reducing the tumor weight and size without altering the therapeutic effects of citral. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The incidence of developing cancer should increase with the body mass, yet is not the case, a conundrum referred to as Peto’s paradox. Elephants have a lower incidence of cancer suggesting that these animals have probably evolved different ways to protect themselves against the disease. The paradox is worth revisiting with the realization that most mammals encode an endogenous APOBEC3 cytidine deaminase capable of mutating single stranded DNA. Indeed, the mutagenic activity of some APOBEC3 enzymes has been shown to introduce somatic mutations into genomic DNA. These enzymes are now recognized as causal agent responsible for the accumulation of CG- > TA transitions and DNA breaks leading to chromosomal rearrangements in human cancer genomes. Here, we identified an elephant A3Z1 gene, related to human APOBEC3A and showed that it could efficiently deaminate cytidine, 5-methylcytidine and produce DNA breaks leading to massive apoptosis, similar to other mammalian APOBEC3A enzymes where body mass varies by up to four orders of magnitude. Consequently, it could be considered that eAZ1 might contribute to cancer in elephants in a manner similar to their proposed role in humans. If so, eAZ1 might be particularly well regulated to counter Peto’s paradox. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Despite recent improvements in treatment, ovarian cancer is still the leading cause of death from gynaecological malignancies. Today, marine mollusks are considered as natural source of new biologically and pharmacologically active compounds by scientists and the pharmaceutical industries. The aim of this study is to investigate the selective apoptotic effects of Turbo coronatus crude extract fractions on human epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells and mitochondria. The cells and mitochondria were isolated from cancerous and non-cancerous ovarian tissues and exposed to IC 50 concentration of F1 fraction for evaluation of mitochondrial and cellular parameters. Our results showed that F1 fraction of T. coronatus crude extract significantly induced toxic effects only in the cancerous ovarian mitochondria, including increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, mitochondrial swelling, and cytochrome c release.Flow-cytometry analysis demonstrated that F1 fraction of T. coronatus progressively induced apoptosis and necrosis only on EOC but not non-cancerous cells. We eventuallyconcluded that F1 fraction of T. coronatus crude extract selectively induces apoptosis in EOC through a ROS-mediated pathway. © 2018, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

        fabio:abstract     "Artemisinin is used as an antimalarial and anticancer agent with minimal toxic effects on the host body. Biotin-PEG-PCL polymers have been used for targeted drug delivery to cancer, as well as to improve the pharmacokinetics of the drug and reduce its effects. In this study, biotin-conjugated copolymers were fabricated with polymerization of the ring opening method and the properties of copolymer and nanoparticles were investigated using various techniques. The toxicity of artemisinin and its nanoparticles have been investigated on MCF-7 and normal HFF2 cells. The results showed that the encapsulation efficacy of artemisinin in nanoparticles was 45.5 ± 0.41%. The release profile of the drug indicates that the release is slow and controlled and is approximately pH dependent. The results of artemisinin cell culture on human breast cancer cells showed that biotin-PEG-PCL nanoparticles had an inhibitory effect on MCF-7 cells and had no toxic effects on HFF2 cells. Anticancer activity in vivo in the 4T1 breast cancer model showed that tumour volumes were decreased up 40 mm3 by ART-loaded micelles and 76 mm3 by free ART, compared to the control group (2150 mm). In vivo results showed that this formulation significantly increases the accumulation of substances in the tumours. Therefore, the molecular formulation of ART-based copolymers can be a desirable process for cancer treatment purposes. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group." ;

It has been estimated that there are about 2 billion people with a serological profile of HBV infection, and 360 million patients worldwide living with chronic HBV-associated liver disease, hence the need to find an efficient and precise diagnosis technique to drive a robust treatment for Hepatitis B virus cannot be over emphasized. The emergence of analytical device like biosensor which combines biological and physicochemical element to detect HBV in screened samples has been very helpful in providing a timely intervention to tame this virus.

        fabio:abstract    "n-Butylidenephthalide (BP) is a potential anti-cancer drug, which can be extracted from Angelica sinensis (Danggui). Previous reports have shown the effectiveness of BP in treating cancer diseases. However, BP has no targeting capacity towards specific cancer cells. To improve treatment efficiency and reduce the dose of BP used in cancer treatment, targeting-based approaches should be developed. In the present study, we used riboflavin-5′-phosphate (RFMP) immobilized iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4 MNPs) as carriers for BP to treat cancer cell lines derived from liver, prostate and breast. These model cancer cells overexpress riboflavin receptors on their cell membrane and are also sensitive to BP treatment. Thus, BP-binding free RFMP on MNPs can be used as probes to target these model cells, whereas BP can be readily released on target cancer cells. Cell viability was twofold lower by using Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs immobilized with BP than that achieved by using free-form BP at a similar amount. Moreover, BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs have no apparent harmful effects on non-target cells. In addition, we evaluated the level of cysteine-aspartic acid protease 3 (caspase 3) in the resultant cell lysate obtained after treatment by BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs to demonstrate that apoptosis is mainly involved in the growth inhibition of target cells. © 2017, © 2017 The Author(s).

The aim of this national population-based retrospective study was to analyze the relationship between MetS and the incidence of laryngeal cancer. Patients with laryngeal cancer (ICD-10: C32) between 2009 and 2010 were retrospectively identified and tracked until 2015 using the Korean Health Insurance claims database. During the seven-year follow-up period, 5,322 subjects were newly diagnosed with larynx cancer. The mean age of people with laryngeal cancer was much higher than those without (63.29 vs. 47.7 years, p < 0.0001), and the incidence of larynx cancer in men was much higher than that in women (93.16% vs. 6.84%, p < 0.0001). Age, gender, smoking status, alcohol intake, and exercise-adjusted hazard ratios indicated that participants with MetS had a 1.13-fold higher hazard of having larynx cancer than those without MetS. The number of MetS components was a strong risk factor for laryngeal cancer with a higher risk estimate of this cancer in both ex- and current smokers as well as people who have never smoked. MetS was found to be an independent risk factor for the incidence of laryngeal cancer. In Korea, MetS and its components are significantly associated with the development of laryngeal cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

In this study, we demonstrated that FLOT2 expression levels were greatly upregulated in glioma tissues and cell lines, and the FLOT2 expression in glioma tissue was markedly associated with tumour stage and size. Overexpression of FLOT2 was correlated with poor prognosis of glioma patients. The functional assay revealed that silenced FLOT2 repressed the viability, migration, and invasion of glioma cells. And then, we detected the relationship between miR-449 and FLOT2. Luciferase reporter assay and Western blot results showed that miR-449 directly binding the 3′UTR sequence of FLOT2 and regulated FLOT2 expression in glioma cells. Finally, we detected the expression levels of miR-449 in glioma tissue and cell lines and found that miR-449 was significantly downregulated in glioma tissues and cell lines. In conclusion, we demonstrated that overexpression FLOT2 was associated with poor prognosis of glioma patients and involved in the progression of glioma, identifying a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for glioma progression. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group." ;

One of the consequences of chromosomal rearrangement is gene fusions in the cancer genome. We have previously identified a panel of fusion genes in aggressive prostate cancers. In this study, we showed that 6 of these fusion genes are present in 7 different types of human malignancies with variable frequencies. Among them, the CCNH-C5orf30 and TRMT11-GRIK2 gene fusions were found in breast cancer, colon cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, ovarian cancer and liver cancer, with frequencies ranging from 12.9% to 85%. In contrast, four other gene fusions (mTOR-TP53BP1, TMEM135-CCDC67, KDM4-AC011523.2 and LRRC59-FLJ60017) are less frequent. Both TRMT11-GRIK2 and CCNH-C5orf30 are also frequently present in lymph node metastatic cancer samples from the breast, colon and ovary. Thus, detecting these fusion transcripts may have significant biological and clinical implications in cancer patient management. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Quantifying the genetic correlation between cancers can provide important insights into the mechanisms driving cancer etiology. Using genome-wide association study summary statistics across six cancer types based on a total of 296,215 cases and 301,319 controls of European ancestry, here we estimate the pair-wise genetic correlations between breast, colorectal, head/neck, lung, ovary and prostate cancer, and between cancers and 38 other diseases. We observed statistically significant genetic correlations between lung and head/neck cancer (r g = 0.57, p = 4.6 × 10 −8 ), breast and ovarian cancer (r g = 0.24, p = 7 × 10 −5 ), breast and lung cancer (r g = 0.18, p =1.5 × 10 −6 ) and breast and colorectal cancer (r g = 0.15, p = 1.1 × 10 −4 ). We also found that multiple cancers are genetically correlated with non-cancer traits including smoking, psychiatric diseases and metabolic characteristics. Functional enrichment analysis revealed a significant excess contribution of conserved and regulatory regions to cancer heritability. Our comprehensive analysis of cross-cancer heritability suggests that solid tumors arising across tissues share in part a common germline genetic basis. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Purpose: Several previous studies have shown that oral bisphosphonates (BPs) are associated with the incidence of 13 specific cancers, including lung cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the findings are heterogeneous. Methods and results: Relevant studies published in databases such as PubMed, Embase database, and Cochrane library were systematically retrieved from inception to August 25th, 2017, regardless of language, by two investigators independently. Afterwards, the maximum adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted from the retrieved studies. Finally, 13 cohort studies involving 1,510,763 participants were enrolled into this meta-analysis. No significant relationship was found between oral BPs and the risk of all-cause cancer in osteoporosis (OP) patients among the entire population (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80–1.18; I 2 92.5%). Besides, oral BPs could remarkably reduce the incidence of breast cancer (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68–0.92; I 2 54%) and endometrial cancer (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64–0.96; I 2 0%) in postmenopausal OP females. In addition, oral BPs were also found to evidently reduce the incidence of upper gastrointestinal cancer in OP patients among the entire population (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54–0.98; I 2 36.1%). However, oral BPs may lead to increased risk of liver cancer in mixed genders (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.03–2.77; I 2 30.7%). Conclusions: Taken together, oral BPs do not increase the risk of incidence of all-cause cancer; instead, they can reduce the incidence of breast, endometrial, and upper gastrointestinal cancers among the postmenopausal OP females. Our analysis stratified by gender suggests that oral BPs may increase the incidence of liver cancer in mixed genders, while no significant association was observed in females. Careful analysis of post-marketing data should be conducted to address the clinical relevance of our results on the putative association of oral BP use and liver cancer suggested by our meta-analysis. © 2017, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play critical roles in the tumor progression. However, it remains unclear how cancer cells migrate in the three-dimensional (3D) matrix of cancer tissues and how CAFs support the cancer invasion. Here we propose a novel mechanism of fibroblast-dependent cancer cell invasion in the 3D collagen matrix. Human cancer cell lines from the pancreas (Panc-1), lung (A549) and some other organs actively adhered to normal fibroblasts and primary lung CAFs in cultures. To show its significance in tumor invasion, we designed a new invasion assay in which homogeneous microspheroids consisting of cancer cells and fibroblasts were embedded into collagen gel. Time-lapse experiments showed that cancer cells adhered to and quickly migrated on the long protrusions of fibroblasts in the 3D collagen matrix. Fibroblast-free cancer cells poorly invaded the matrix. Experiments with function-blocking antibodies, siRNAs, and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that cancer cells adhered to fibroblasts through integrin α5β1-mediated binding to fibronectin on the surface of fibroblasts. Immunochemical analyses of the co-cultures and lung cancers suggested that cancer cells could acquire the migratory force by the fibronectin/integrin signaling. Our results also revealed that the fibroblast-bound fibronectin was a preferential substrate for cancer cells to migrate in the collagen matrix. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The prognosis of pancreatic cancer remains dismal despite continuous and considerable efforts. Integrins (ITGs) are highly expressed in various malignant cancers. However, very few studies investigated the role of integrin α3 (ITGα3) in malignant cancers. Here, we determined the functional role of ITGα3 in pancreatic cancer. Analysis of public microarray databases and Western blot analysis indicated a unique expression of ITGα3 in human pancreatic cancer. Silencing ITGα3 expression significantly inhibited the viability and migration of human pancreatic cancer cells. Notably, ablation of ITGα3 expression resulted in a significant decrease of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression compared with transfection of control-siRNA through an increased number of leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domain protein 1 (LRIG1) expression. In addition, ablating ITGα3 inhibited tumour growth via blockade of EGFR signalling in vivo. Furthermore, the highly expressed ITGα3 led to a poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. Our results provide novel insights into ITGα3-induced aggressive pancreatic cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Breast cancer metastasis accounts for most of the deaths from breast cancer. Since epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in promoting metastasis of cancer, many mechanisms regarding EMT have been studied. We previously showed that Ribonucleic acid export 1 (RAE1) is dysregulated in breast cancer and its overexpression leads to aggressive breast cancer phenotypes by inducing EMT. Here, we evaluated the functional capacity of RAE1 in breast cancer metastasis by using a three-dimensional (3D) culture system and xenograft models. Furthermore, to investigate the mechanisms of RAE1-driven EMT, in vitro studies were carried out. The induction of EMT with RAE1-overexpression was confirmed under the 3D culture system and in vivo system. Importantly, RAE1 mediates upregulation of an EMT marker ZEB1, by binding to the promoter region of ZEB1. Knockdown of ZEB1 in RAE1-overexpressing cells suppressed invasive and migratory behaviors, accompanied by an increase in epithelial and a decrease in mesenchymal markers. Taken together, these data demonstrate that RAE1 contributes to breast cancer metastasis by regulating a key EMT-inducing factor ZEB1 expression, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Obesity is a risk factor for many cancers including breast, esophageal, colon, and thyroid cancer. We aimed to evaluate the association of thyroid cancer with body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and weight change. This nationwide population-based cohort study included 11,323,006 adults who joined the national health screening program. Weight change was defined as the difference between the weight of the subjects measured during the study period and the weight at the time of four years ago. For evaluating the association between the weight change and the risk of thyroid cancer, subjects without weight change for four years were defined as the reference group. Mean age was 50.1 ± 13.7 years and 44% were female. In total, 50,464 subjects (0.4%) had newly-diagnosed thyroid cancer. After multivariable analyses, the incidence of thyroid cancer increased significantly in subjects with larger WC as well as higher BMI (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). In subjects who were lean and became obese, the incidence of thyroid cancers increased significantly (hazard ratio [HR] 1.15 [1.11–1.19]). In subjects who were obese and became lean, the incidence of thyroid cancers decreased significantly (HR 0.89 [0.86–0.93]). These results demonstrated that higher BMI and larger WC were significantly associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer. Weight gain in lean subjects was associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer, and weight reduction in subjects with obesity was associated with a decreased risk of thyroid cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) has increased among Norwegian women, and is among the highest in the world. In order to understand this increase, country specific dietary exposures have been investigated. The aim of this study was to quantify the association between consumption of brown cheese, a common bread topping in Norway, and colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer in the prospective Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) Study. Data on brown cheese consumption and adjustment factors was available for 82 527 women. During a mean of 14.6 years of follow-up (1.2 million person-years), there were 1360 cases of colorectal cancer (907 colon; 453 rectal). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer sites. We modelled restricted cubic splines with 4 knots, to assess a possible non-linear relationship between brown cheese intake and the investigated cancer sites. In the age-adjusted model, consumption of more than 2 slices (>16 grams) of brown cheese per day was associated with 13% reduced risk of colon cancer (95% CI 4%-21%) compared to women who did not consume brown cheese. The multivariable-adjusted model, however, showed no association between brown cheese consumption and the risk of colorectal, colon, or rectal cancer (colorectal: HR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.76–1.13, p-trend 0.37; colon: HR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.65–1.06; p-trend = 0.10; rectal: HR = 1.16, 95% CI 0.84–1.1.61, p-trend = 0.41). In this large, prospective cohort study of women, consumption of brown cheese was suggestively protective against colon cancer. However, adjustment attenuated the inverse risk association. Brown cheese consumption was not associated with rectal cancer, or colorectal cancer overall. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Current cancer diagnosis utilizes histopathology, which requires tissue acquisition, extensive processing and, in most cases, relies on the qualitative morphological analysis of tissues and cells. Molecular biomarkers are only available for a few specific tumor subtypes. We discovered that the fluorescence polarization (Fpol) of Methylene Blue (MB) is significantly higher in cancer than in normal human breast tissues and cells. We confirmed that fluorescence polarization imaging did not affect the viability of the cells and yielded highly significant differences between cancer and normal cells using MB concentrations as low as 0.05 and 0.01 mg/ml. To explain this phenomenon we examined intracellular localization of MB and its fluorescence lifetime. We determined that higher fluorescence polarization of MB occurs due to its increased accumulation in mitochondria of cancer cells, as well as shorter fluorescence lifetime in cancer relative to normal cells. As quantitative MB Fpol imaging can be performed in vivo and in real time, it holds the potential to provide an accurate quantitative marker of cancer at the cellular level. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

However, the specific combinations of mutations responsible for the vast majority of cancers have not been identified. Current computational approaches focus on identifying driver genes and mutations. Although individually these mutations can increase the risk of cancer they do not result in cancer without additional mutations. We present a fundamentally different approach for identifying the cause of individual instances of cancer: we search for combinations of genes with carcinogenic mutations (multi-hit combinations) instead of individual driver genes or mutations. We developed an algorithm that identified a set of multi-hit combinations that differentiate between tumor and normal tissue samples with 91% sensitivity (95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 89–92%) and 93% specificity (95% CI = 91–94%) on average for seventeen cancer types. We then present an approach based on mutational profile that can be used to distinguish between driver and passenger mutations within these genes. These combinations, with experimental validation, can aid in better diagnosis, provide insights into the etiology of cancer, and provide a rational basis for designing targeted combination therapies. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

We developed a novel computational platform applying a multi-modal approach to filter out passengers and more robustly identify putative driver genes. The primary filter identifies enrichment of cancer mutations in CATH functional families (CATH-FunFams) – structurally and functionally coherent sets of evolutionary related domains. Using structural representatives from CATH-FunFams, we subsequently seek enrichment of mutations in 3D and show that these mutation clusters have a very significant tendency to lie close to known functional sites or conserved sites predicted using CATH-FunFams. Our third filter identifies enrichment of putative driver genes in functionally coherent protein network modules confirmed by literature analysis to be cancer associated. Our approach is complementary to other domain enrichment approaches exploiting Pfam families, but benefits from more functionally coherent groupings of domains. Using a set of mutations from 22 cancers we detect 151 putative cancer drivers, of which 79 are not listed in cancer resources and include recently validated cancer associated genes EPHA7, DCC netrin-1 receptor and zinc-finger protein ZNF479. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Collectively, 86.3% (63/73) of HAMPs have recurrent alterations in at least 1 cancer type and 16 HAMPs, including 9 understudied HAMPs, are identified as putative therapeutic targets across multiple cancer types. For example, the recurrent focal amplification of BRD9 is observed in 9 cancer types and genetic depletion of BRD9 inhibits tumor growth.

        fabio:abstract    "The current system for evaluating prostate cancer architecture is the Gleason grading system which divides the morphology of cancer into five distinct architectural patterns, labeled 1 to 5 in increasing levels of cancer aggressiveness, and generates a score by summing the labels of the two most dominant patterns. The Gleason score is currently the most powerful prognostic predictor of patient outcomes; however, it suffers from problems in reproducibility and consistency due to the high intra-observer and inter-observer variability amongst pathologists. In addition, the Gleason system lacks the granularity to address potentially prognostic architectural features beyond Gleason patterns. We evaluate prostate cancer for architectural subtypes using techniques from topological data analysis applied to prostate cancer glandular architecture. In this work we demonstrate the use of persistent homology to capture architectural features independently of Gleason patterns. Specifically, using persistent homology, we compute topological representations of purely graded prostate cancer histopathology images of Gleason patterns 3,4 and 5, and show that persistent homology is capable of clustering prostate cancer histology into architectural groups through a ranked persistence vector. Our results indicate the ability of persistent homology to cluster prostate cancer histopathology images into unique groups with dominant architectural patterns consistent with the continuum of Gleason patterns. In addition, of particular interest, is the sensitivity of persistent homology to identify specific sub-architectural groups within single Gleason patterns, suggesting that persistent homology could represent a robust quantification method for prostate cancer architecture with higher granularity than the existing semi-quantitative measures. The capability of these topological representations to segregate prostate cancer by architecture makes them an ideal candidate for use as inputs to future machine learning approaches with the intent of augmenting traditional approaches with topological features for improved diagnosis and prognosis. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Among 8,651,569 cancer patients, 13,311 committed suicide; the rate of suicide was 28.58/ 100,000-person years, and the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of suicide was 4.44 (95% CI, 4.33, 4.55). The predominant patients who committed suicide were male (83%) and white (92%). Cancers of the lung, head and neck, testes, bladder, and Hodgkin lymphoma had the highest SMRs (> 5-10) through the follow up period. Elderly, white, unmarried males with localized disease are at highest risk vs other cancer patients. Among those diagnosed at < 50 years of age, the plurality of suicides is from hematologic and testicular tumors; if > 50, from prostate, lung, and colorectal cancer patients. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

However, the specific combinations of mutations responsible for the vast majority of cancers have not been identified. Current computational approaches focus on identifying driver genes and mutations. Although individually these mutations can increase the risk of cancer they do not result in cancer without additional mutations. We present a fundamentally different approach for identifying the cause of individual instances of cancer: we search for combinations of genes with carcinogenic mutations (multi-hit combinations) instead of individual driver genes or mutations. We developed an algorithm that identified a set of multi-hit combinations that differentiate between tumor and normal tissue samples with 91% sensitivity (95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 89–92%) and 93% specificity (95% CI = 91–94%) on average for seventeen cancer types. We then present an approach based on mutational profile that can be used to distinguish between driver and passenger mutations within these genes. These combinations, with experimental validation, can aid in better diagnosis, provide insights into the etiology of cancer, and provide a rational basis for designing targeted combination therapies. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The UHRF1-DNMT1 axis plays a key role in DNA maintenance methylation in mammals. Accumulative studies demonstrate that UHRF1 is broadly overexpressed in cancers, which contributes to cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Interestingly, a proteasome-dependent downregulation of UHRF1 has been observed in pluripotent ground state mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) cultured in the presence of two kinase (MEK1/MEK2 and GSK3β) inhibitors (termed 2i), raising the question whether UHRF1 is similarly regulated in cancer cells. Here we present evidence that while addition of 2i broadly downregulates UHRF1 and DNMT1 in various cancer cells, distinct underlying mechanisms are involved. In contrast to mESCs, 2i-induced downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in cancer cells cannot be rescued by proteasome inhibitor and occurs primarily at the level of transcription. Furthermore, downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 by 2i is due to inhibition of MEK1/MEK2, but not GSK3β activity. Data mining reveals a marked co-expression of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in normal tissues as well as cancers. We provide evidence that multiple transcription factors including E2F1 and SP1 mediate the transcriptional activation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 by the activated MEK/ERK pathway. Together our study reveals distinct regulation of UHRF1/DNMT1 in mESCs and cancer cells and identifies activated MEK/ERK pathway as a driving force for coordinated and aberrant over-expression of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in cancers. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

When it is applied to cancer cells, solid stress hinders their proliferation rate and promotes cancer cell invasion and metastatic potential. However, the underlying mechanisms of how it is implicated in cancer metastasis is not yet fully understood. Here, we used two pancreatic cancer cell lines and an established in vitro system to study the effect of solid stress-induced signal transduction on pancreatic cancer cell migration as well as the mechanism involved. Our results show that the migratory ability of cells increases as a direct response to solid stress. We also found that Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) expression and secretion is strongly upregulated in pancreatic cancer cells in response to mechanical compression. Performing a phosphoprotein screening, we identified that solid stress activates the Akt/CREB1 pathway to transcriptionally regulate GDF15 expression, which eventually promotes pancreatic cancer cell migration. Our results suggest a novel solid stress signal transduction mechanism bringing GDF15 to the centre of pancreatic tumor biology and rendering it a potential target for future anti-metastatic therapeutic innovations. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a cancer treatment that make use of the cancer-specific accumulation of porphyrins. We have reported that mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mitROS) upregulate uptake transporter of porphyrins, heme carrier protein-1 (HCP-1). The accumulation of cancer-specific porphyrins was increased by mitROS production, thereby the cancer-specific PDT cytotoxicity was enhanced. Thus we investigated whether mitROS production by hyperthermia can enhanced the cytotoxicity of PDT or not. In this study, 1 h of hyperthermia at 42 °C increased the mitROS production, and both the accumulation of cancer-specific porphyrins and the PDT cytotoxicity increased. Moreover, the authors treated cells with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) to examine the effect of mitROS. NAC inhibited the increasing ROS production after hyperthermia to restrain the post-treatment increase of cancer-specific porphyrins accumulation. Moreover, the increase of ROS production in cancer cells after hyperthermia upregulated HCP-1 expression and downregulated ABCG2 expression. These regulation were inhibited by NAC. These results suggest that hyperthermia treatment increased mitROS production, which involved HpD accumulation and enhanced PDT effects in cancer cells. The mechanism of this phenomenon was most likely to be due to both the upregulation of HCP-1 and the downregulation of ABCG2 by mitROS. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

In this study, we assessed the relationship between breast cancer and cadaverine biosynthesis. Cadaverine treatment of Balb/c female mice (500 nmol/kg p.o. q.d.) grafted with 4T1 breast cancer cells ameliorated the disease (lower mass and infiltration of the primary tumor, fewer metastases, and lower grade tumors). Cadaverine treatment of breast cancer cell lines corresponding to its serum reference range (100–800 nM) reverted endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, inhibited cellular movement and invasion, moreover, rendered cells less stem cell-like through reducing mitochondrial oxidation. Trace amino acid receptors (TAARs), namely, TAAR1, TAAR8 and TAAR9 were instrumental in provoking the cadaverine-evoked effects. Early stage breast cancer patients, versus control women, had reduced abundance of the CadA and LdcC genes in fecal DNA, both responsible for bacterial cadaverine production. Moreover, we found low protein expression of E. coli LdcC in the feces of stage 1 breast cancer patients. In addition, higher expression of lysine decarboxylase resulted in a prolonged survival among early-stage breast cancer patients. Taken together, cadaverine production seems to be a regulator of early breast cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Exogenous overexpression of CBX6 inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation, and induced cell cycle arrest along with suppression of migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro. Microarray analyses revealed that CBX6 governs a complex gene expression program. Moreover, CBX6 induced significant downregulation of bone marrow stromal cell antigen-2 (BST2), a potential therapeutic target, via interactions with its promoter region.

        fabio:abstract    "MRI plays important roles in endometrial and cervical cancer assessment, from detection to recurrent disease evaluation. Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common malignant tumor of the female genital tract in Western countries. EC patients are divided into risk categories based on histopathological tumor type, grade, and myometrial invasion depth. EC is surgically staged using the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) system. Since FIGO (2009) stage correlates with prognosis, preoperative staging is essential for tailored treatment. MRI reveals myometrial invasion depth, which correlates with tumor grade and lymph node metastases, and thus correlates with prognosis. Cervical cancer (CC) is the second most common cancer, and the third leading cause of cancer-related death among females in developing countries. The FIGO Gynecologic Oncology Committee recently revised its CC staging guidelines, allowing staging based on imaging and pathological findings when available. The revised FIGO (2017) staging includes node involvement and thus enables both therapy selection and evaluation, prognosis estimation, and calculation of end results. MRI can accurately assess prognostic indicators, e.g., tumor size, parametrial invasion, pelvic sidewall, and lymph node invasion. Despite these important roles of MRI, radiologists still face challenges due to the technical and interpretation pitfalls of MRI during all phases of endometrial and cervical cancer evaluation. Awareness of mimics that can simulate both cancers is critical. With careful application, functional MRI with DWI and DCE sequences can help establish a correct diagnosis, although it is sometimes necessary to perform biopsy and histopathological analysis. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Our observations were confirmed in a large variety of solid and haematological malignancies. This test was able to detect dysplasia and carcinomas in situ lesions in different organs and circulating factors in cancer patients years after the removal of their lesions. To our knowledge, this ability is unique and not shared by other liquid biopsy platforms. Immunohistochemistry analysis of the xenotransplants revealed identical patterns of differentiation regardless of the cancer type, showing that differentiation through horizontal transfer might be dependent on the nature of the target cells rather than the type of cancer factors.

Various studies have shown the significance of identifying drug targets for cancer, although this process continues challenging in the field of anti-cancer drug designing. The primary purpose of this study is to design a novel approach to identify target genes for cancer. The sub-network of colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancers were constructed from human protein–protein interaction network. The potential genes were analyzed using hubs and centrality measures. For the identification of target genes, we retrieve those genes that had the highest score in both mutation rates and graph centrality. Moreover, gene deletion analysis revealed that MYC, TP53, and EGFR genes remained potential targets in colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancer respectively. Results suggest that combining network measures with mutation frequencies in cancer genes might assist in recognizing several potential drug targets. Future enhancement of this current approach is to combine these network properties with the biological insights from gene expression data, and their functions will provide a reliable method for rational drug designing. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature." ;

As extracellular matrix, glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) could bind its surface receptor adhesion molecule CD44 which is strongly expressed on breast cancer. We have previously reported a doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded HA-Lys-LA X-NPs (X-NP-DOX) NP delivery system for breast cancer treatment. In this study, we further investigated the antitumor effect of X-NP-DOX NP delivery system using low-dose DOX in both in vitro and in vivo systems. We demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX possessed the ability for inhibiting MCF-7 breast cancer cell growth, invasion, and migration, and inducing apoptosis in vitro. In in vivo experiments, injection of low-dose X-NP-DOX into tumor-bearing mouse resulted in significant reduction of tumor size. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining further revealed that low-dose X-NP-DOX induced higher percentage of apoptotic cells compared with free DOX or saline. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX inhibited Notch1 and Ras/MAPK pathways, decreased cancer stem cell population, and reduced tumorigenesis compared to free DOX in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Owing to its enhanced efficacy and higher targetability compared to free DOX, low-dose DOX delivered by NP system may be a promising novel strategy for breast cancer treatment." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Breast cancer survivors display altered inflammatory responses to immune challenges relative to cancer-naive controls likely due to previous cancer treatments, stress associated with cancer, and/or tumor physiology. Proper inflammatory responses are necessary for adaptive sickness behaviors (e.g., fatigue, anorexia, and fever) and neuroinflammatory pathways are also implicated in mental health disturbances (e.g., cognitive impairment, depression) suffered by cancer patients and survivors. Rodent cancer models indicate that tumors are sufficient to exacerbate neuroinflammatory responses after an immune challenge, however primary tumors are not usually present in cancer survivors, and the behavioral consequences of these brain changes remain understudied. Therefore, we tested the extent to which mammary tumor resection attenuates tumor-induced neuroinflammation and sickness behavior following an immune challenge (i.p. lipopolysaccharide [LPS] injection) in mice. Tnf-α, Il-1β, and Il-6 mRNA decreased in multiple brain regions of LPS-treated tumor-bearing mice relative to LPS-treated controls; tumor resection attenuated these effects in some cases (but not Tnf-α). Tumors also attenuated sickness behaviors (hypothermia and lethargy) compared to LPS-treated controls. Tumor resection reversed these behavioral consequences, although basal body temperature remained elevated, comparable to tumor-bearing mice. Thus, tumors significantly modulate neuroinflammatory pathways with functional consequences and tumor resection mitigates most, but not all, of these changes. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Although substantial advances have been obtained both in treatment and survival rates, there is still a need for new therapeutical approaches. Natural compounds are a realistic source of new bioactive compounds with anticancer activity. Among them, rosemary polyphenols have shown a vast antiproliferative capacity against colon cancer cells in vitro and in animal models. We have investigated the antitumor activity of a rosemary extract (RE) obtained by using supercritical fluid extraction through its capacity to inhibit various signatures of cancer progression and metastasis such as proliferation, migration, invasion and clonogenic survival. RE strongly inhibited proliferation, migration and colony formation of colon cancer cells regardless their phenotype. Treatment with RE led to a sharp increase of intracellular ROS that resulted in necrosis cell death. Nrf2 gene silencing increased RE cytotoxic effects, thus suggesting that this pathway was involved in cell survival. These in vitro results were in line with a reduction of tumor growth by oral administration of RE in a xenograft model of colon cancer cells using athymic nude mice. These findings indicate that targeting colon cancer cells by increasing intracellular ROS and decreasing cell survival mechanisms may suppose a therapeutic option in colon cancer through the combination of rosemary compounds and chemotherapeutic drugs. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Although cure rates are high for early stage disease, clinical outcomes for advanced, metastatic, or recurrent disease remain poor. To change this panorama, a deeper understanding of cervical cancer biology and novel study models are needed. Immortalized human cancer cell lines such as HeLa constitute crucial scientific tools, but there are few other cervical cancer cell lines available, limiting our understanding of a disease known for its molecular heterogeneity. This study aimed to establish novel cervical cancer cell lines derived from Brazilian patients. We successfully established one (HCB-514) out of 35 cervical tumors biopsied. We confirmed the phenotype of HCB-514 by verifying its’ epithelial and tumor origin through cytokeratins, EpCAM and p16 staining. It was also HPV-16 positive. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) showed relevant somatic mutations in several genes including BRCA2, TGFBR1 and IRX2. A copy number variation (CNV) analysis by nanostring and WES revealed amplification of genes mainly related to kinases proteins involved in proliferation, migration and cell differentiation, such as EGFR, PIK3CA, and MAPK7. Overexpression of EGFR was confirmed by phospho RTK-array and validated by western blot analysis. Furthermore, the HCB-514 cell line was sensitive to cisplatin. In summary, this novel Brazilian cervical cancer cell line exhibits relevant key molecular features and constitutes a new biological model for pre-clinical studies. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

To determine how cancer cells adapt to RS, we have monitored the expression of different components of the ATR-CHK1 pathway in primary tumor samples. We show that unlike upstream components of the pathway, the checkpoint mediators Claspin and Timeless are overexpressed in a coordinated manner. Remarkably, reducing the levels of Claspin and Timeless in HCT116 cells to pretumoral levels impeded fork progression without affecting checkpoint signaling. These data indicate that high level of Claspin and Timeless increase RS tolerance by protecting replication forks in cancer cells. Moreover, we report that primary fibroblasts adapt to oncogene-induced RS by spontaneously overexpressing Claspin and Timeless, independently of ATR signaling. Altogether, these data indicate that enhanced levels of Claspin and Timeless represent a gain of function that protects cancer cells from of oncogene-induced RS in a checkpoint-independent manner. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Curcumin, the active polyphenol from turmeric, helps to obstruct the growth of many types of cancers at various stages which include prostrate, melanoma, breast, brain tumor, pancreatic, leukemia, etc. The initiation and recurrence of cancer have been attributed to few mutated cells in bulk of tumor called as cancer stem cells which have the capacity of self-renewal and differentiation. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3B) is a multifunctional serine/threonine protein kinase, originally found in mammals, an important component of diverse signaling pathways, dysregulation of which leads to affect the cancer stem cell properties. The nutritional- and phytochemical-based dietary interventions may complement current chemotherapy to prevent recurrence and relapse of cancer. The objective of present study is to investigate the effect of retinoic acid and curcumin–retinoic acid conjugates against GSK-3B protein.

Endometrial cancers are associated with several critical gene mutations, including PIK3A, PTEN, and KRAS. Different gene mutations in endometrial cancer cells have varied responses to anticancer drugs and cancer therapies. The most frequently altered gene in endometrioid endometrial carcinoma tumors is PTEN. PTEN protein has lipid phosphatase and protein phosphatase activity, as well as other functions in the nucleus. Although the tumor-suppressive function of PTEN has mainly been attributed to its lipid phosphatase activity, a role for PTEN protein phosphatase activity in cell cycle regulation has also been suggested. Various tumor type-specific PTEN mutations are well documented. Here, nine endometrioid endometrial cancer cell lines with PIK3A, PTEN, and KRAS gene mutations were treated with docetaxel and radiation. One mutation with a docetaxel drug-resistant effect was a truncated form of PTEN. Among PTEN mutations in endometrial cancer cells, the Y68 frame shift mutation of PTEN constitutes a major mechanism of resistance to docetaxel treatment. The molecular mechanism involves truncation of the 403 amino acid PTEN protein at amino acid 68 by the Y68 frame shift, leading to the loss of PTEN protein phosphatase and lipid phosphatase activities. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

The present review comprehends the stimuli-responsive polymers and multi-responsiveness with respect to cancer therapy. It focuses on the exploitation of different stimuli like temperature, pH and enzymes responsiveness in a multi-stimuli setting. Nanogels and micelles being two of the most commonly used responsive polymeric carriers have also been discussed. The role of multiple stimuli delivery system is significant due to multiple changes happening in the near surroundings of cancer cells.

In contrast, antibodies to BLV were found in a very small percentage of healthy blood donors. There was no association between BLV DNA and other tumor prognostic biological markers such as hormonal receptors, HER2 oncoprotein, proliferation index, metastasis in sentinels lymph nodes, and tumor grade and size. Our findings suggest that BLV should be considered a potential predisposing factor to breast cancer in women. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Copy number loss of PIK3R1 (p85α) most commonly occurs in ovarian cancer among all cancer types. Here we report that ovarian cancer cells manifest a spectrum of tumorigenic phenotypes upon knockdown of PIK3R1. PIK3R1 loss activates AKT and p110-independent JAK2/STAT3 signaling through inducing changes in the phosphorylation of the docking protein Gab2, thereby relieving the negative inhibition on AKT and promoting the assembly of JAK2/STAT3 signalosome, respectively. Additional mechanisms leading to AKT activation include enhanced p110α kinase activity and a decrease in PTEN level. PIK3R1 loss renders ovarian cancer cells vulnerable to inhibition of AKT or JAK2/STAT3. The combination of AKT and STAT3 inhibitors significantly increases the anti-tumor effect compared to single-agent treatments. Together, our findings provide a rationale for mechanism-based therapeutic approach that targets tumors with loss of PIK3R1. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we perform Repli-Seq and integrated epigenome analyses and demonstrate that genomic regions that undergo long-range epigenetic deregulation in prostate cancer also show concordant differences in replication timing. A subset of altered replication timing domains are conserved across cancers from different tissue origins. Notably, late-replicating regions in cancer cells display a loss of DNA methylation, and a switch in heterochromatin features from H3K9me3-marked constitutive to H3K27me3-marked facultative heterochromatin. Finally, analysis of 214 prostate and 35 breast cancer genomes reveal that late-replicating regions are prone to cis and early-replication to trans chromosomal rearrangements. Together, our data suggests that the nature of chromosomal rearrangement in cancer is related to the spatial and temporal positioning and altered epigenetic states of early-replicating compared to late-replicating loci. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are promising therapies for haematological cancers. Historically, their therapeutic benefit is due to ADC targeting of lineage-restricted antigens. The C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is attractive for targeted therapy of haematological cancers, given its expression in multiple tumour types and role in cancer “homing” to bone marrow. However, CXCR4 is also expressed in haematopoietic cells and other normal tissues, raising safety challenges to the development of anti-CXCR4 ADCs for cancer treatment. Here, we designed the first anti-CXCR4 ADC with favourable therapeutic index, effective in xenografts of haematopoietic cancers resistant to standard of care and anti-CXCR4 antibodies. We screened multiple ADC configurations, by varying type of linker-payload, drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR), affinity and Fc format. The optimal ADC bears a non-cleavable linker, auristatin as payload at DAR = 4 and a low affinity antibody with effector–reduced Fc. Contrary to other drugs targeting CXCR4, anti-CXCR4 ADCs effectively eliminated cancer cells as monotherapy, while minimizing leucocytosis. The optimal ADC selectively eliminated CXCR4 + cancer cells in solid tumours, but showed limited toxicity to normal CXCR4 + tissues, sparing haematopoietic stem cells and progenitors. Our work provides proof-of-concept that through empirical ADC design, it is possible to target proteins with broad normal tissue expression. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Cancers in the bone produce a number of severe symptoms including pain that compromises patient functional status, quality of life, and survival. The source of this pain is multifaceted and includes factors secreted from tumor cells. Malignant cells release the neurotransmitter and cell-signaling molecule glutamate via the oxidative stress-related cystine/glutamate antiporter, system x C − , which reciprocally imports cystine for synthesis of glutathione and the cystine/cysteine redox cycle. Pharmacological inhibition of system x C − has shown success in reducing and delaying the onset of cancer pain-related behavior in mouse models. This investigation describes the development of a stable siRNA-induced knockdown of the functional trans-membrane system x C − subunit xCT (SLC7A11) in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Clones were verified for xCT knockdown at the transcript, protein, and functional levels. RNAseq was performed on a representative clone to comprehensively examine the transcriptional cellular signature in response to xCT knockdown, identifying multiple differentially regulated factors relevant to cancer pain including nerve growth factor, interleukin-1, and colony-stimulating factor-1. Mice were inoculated intrafemorally and recordings of pain-related behaviors including weight bearing, mechanical withdrawal, and limb use were performed. Animals implanted with xCT knockdown cancer cells displayed a delay until the onset of nociceptive behaviors relative to control cells. These results add to the body of evidence suggesting that a reduction in glutamate release from cancers in bone by inhibition of the system x C − transporter may decrease the severe and intractable pain associated with bone metastases. © The Author(s) 2017." ;

Method: For finding the related articles, the researchers searched several databases including PubMed &ProQuest and valid websites including ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Scientific Information Database, and Magiran. The key terms of \"reflexology, cancer, and chemotherapy\" individually and combined together were searched in Parisian and English, and the studies performed from 2009 to 2017 were extracted. Due to the lack of sufficient studies carried out into the outcome of reflexology on chemotherapy, both Persian and English articles were used. Results: A total of 57 studies were extracted from the databases and valid websites; five of which met the inclusion criteria. All selected studies were clinical trials. Implications for Practice: Reflexology can be used as a non-pharmacologic nursing intervention to alleviate the side effects of chemotherapy and improve the quality of life of cancer patients. © 2017 Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

For effective evaluation of this strategy it is crucial to identify which patients are suited for CD47-targeted therapy. In this respect, expression of the pro-phagocytic signal SLAMF7 on both macrophages and cancer cells was recently reported to be a requisite for CD47 antibody-mediated phagocytosis. Here, we demonstrate that in fact SLAMF7 expression on cancer cells is not required and does not impact on CD47 antibody therapy. Moreover, SLAMF7 also does not impact on phagocytosis induction by CD20 antibody rituximab nor associates with overall survival of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma patients. In contrast, expression of CD47 negatively impacts on overall and progression free survival. In conclusion, cancer cell expression of SLAMF7 is not required for phagocytosis and, in contrast to CD47 expression, should not be used as selection criterion for CD47-targeted therapy. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Increased Crabp2 levels have been found in various types of cancer, and are associated with poor patients’ survival. Although Crabp2 is found to be overexpressed in lung cancer, its role in metastasis of lung cancer is unclear. In this study, Crabp2 was overexpressed in high-metastatic C10F4 than low-metastatic lung cancer cells. Analysis of clinical samples revealed that high CRABP2 levels were correlated with lymph node metastases, poor overall survival, and increased recurrence. Knockdown of Crabp2 decreased migration, invasion, anoikis resistance, and in vivo metastasis. Crabp2 was co-immunoprecipitated with HuR, and overexpression of Crabp2 increased HuR levels, which promoted integrin β1/FAK/ERK signaling. Inhibition of HuR or integrin β1/FAK/ERK signaling reversed the promoting effect of Crabp2 in migration, invasion, and anoikis resistance. Knockdown of Crabp2 further inhibited the growth of cancer cells as compared with that by gemcitabine or irinotecan alone. The expression of Crabp2 in human lung tumors was correlated with stress marker CHOP. In conclusion, our findings have identified the promoting role of Crabp2 in anoikis resistance and metastasis. CRABP2 may serve as a prognostic marker and targeting CRABP2 may be exploited as a modality to reduce metastasis. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "SPG-56 is a newly isolated glycoprotein from sweet potatoes (Zhongshu NO. 1), but its value for suppressing breast cancer progression remains unknown. This study was designed to investigate the potential anti-cancer effects of SPG-56, which consists of 2.9% sugar and 97.1% protein. The effects of SPG-56 on the proliferation and apoptosis of breast cancer cells were determined using CCK-8 and Hoechst 33342 assays and flow cytometry, after staining with Annexin V and PI respectively. The activities of SPG-56 against breast cancer were examined using female BALB/c nude mice orthotopically implanted with human breast carcinoma cells of the types MCF-7 and 4T1-Luc. The cellular experiments showed that SPG-56 inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of MCF-7 cells dose- and time-dependently. Oral administration of SPG-56 significantly suppressed the development of MCF-7 tumor cells (P < 0.01) as compared with an untreated group. The serum tumor markers CEA, CA125 and CA153 in a 240 mg/kg/d SPG-56 decreased by 54.8%, 91.8%, and 90.3%, respectively. The experiments further demonstrated that SPG-56 inhibited the metastasis of breast cancer in MCF-7 and 4T1-bearing mice by altering the expression of MMP2, MMP9, VEGF, Occludin and Claudin. It is concluded that SPG-56 may have potential as a novel anti-tumor candidate for breast cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Lymph node metastasis is of major prognostic significance for breast cancer. Lymph node metastasis arises at a very early stage in some patients. Using the data downloaded from the TCGA database, we studied the differences between primary tumors with and without lymph node metastasis at the multi-omics level using bioinformatics approaches. Our study found that low mutation and neoantigen burdens correlated with lymph node metastazation of breast cancer. All three conserved domains in TP53 were mutated in lymph node-negative breast cancers, whereas only one domain was mutated in lymph node-positive samples. Mutations in microtubule-related proteins appear to help immune cells recognize tumors and inhibit their lymph node metastasis. Destroying microtubule-related proteins is a potential therapeutic strategy to inhibit lymph node metastasis of breast cancer. As the neoantigens specifically present in lymph node-positive breast cancers, MAPK10, BC9L, TRIM65, CD93, KITLG, CNPPD1, CPED1, CCDC146, TMEM185A, INO80D, and PSMD11 are potential targets for vaccine design. In the tumor microenvironment, reduced numbers of effector immune cells, especially activated memory CD4+ T cells and activated mast cells, facilitate breast cancer metastasis to the lymph nodes. According to transcriptome data, lymph node metastasis was mostly driven by gene mutation rather than by gene expression. Although differential gene expression analysis was based on lymph node metastasis status, many genes were shown to be differentially expressed based on estrogen receptor status. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Fibroblasts turn into cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumour microenvironment. CAFs have recently attracted attention for their function as a regulator of immune cell recruitment and function in addition to their tumour-promoting roles. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of CAFs on monocyte recruitment and macrophage polarization in breast cancer. CAFs, which were α-SMA expressing fibroblasts in contrast to normal fibroblasts (NFs), effectively recruited monocytes. Recruitment of monocytes by CAFs might be mediated by monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) as well as stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) cytokines. CAFs differentiated the recruited monocytes into M2-like macrophages which are capable of exerting their immunosuppressive roles via the PD-1 axis. CAF-educated monocytes exhibited strong immune suppression unlike NF-educated monocytes and enhanced the motility/invasion of breast cancer cells in addition to increasing the expressions of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes and vimentin protein in cancer cells. CAF-educated M1 macrophages displayed increased expression of M2 markers and production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in contrast to decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12 compared with control M1 macrophages; suggesting that CAFs were also able to induce the trans-differentiation of M1 macrophages to M2 macrophages. We then investigated the relationship between the infiltration of CAFs and tumour associated macrophages (TAMs) using tissue samples obtained from breast cancer patients. High grade of CAFs significantly correlated with the number of TAMs in human breast cancer tissue samples. It was also associated with higher Ki-67 proliferation index, and higher tumour volume. This result is in line with our finding of increased breast cancer cell proliferation due to the effects of CAF-educated monocytes in vitro. Our results concluded that CAFs play pivotal roles in sculpturing the tumour microenvironment in breast cancer, and therapeutic strategies to reverse the CAF-mediated immunosuppressive microenvironment should be taken into consideration. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

We construct iCells of four cancers and the corresponding tissue controls and identify the most rewired genes in cancer. Many of them are of unknown function and cannot be identified as different in cancer in any specific molecular network. We biologically validate that they have a role in cancer by knockdown experiments followed by cell viability assays. We find additional support through Kaplan-Meier survival curves of thousands of patients. Finally, we extend this analysis to uncover pan-cancer genes.

The increasing popularity of sequencing technologies motivates the in-silico identification of CCLs based on their mutational fingerprint, but care must be taken when identifying heterogeneous data. We recently developed the proof-of-concept Uniquorn 1 method which could reliably identify heterogeneous sequencing data from selected sequencing technologies. Here we present Uniquorn 2, a generic and robust in-silico identification method for CCLs with DNA/RNA-seq and panel-seq information. We benchmarked Uniquorn 2 by cross-identifying 1612 RNA and 3596 panel-sized NGS profiles derived from 1516 CCLs, five repositories, four technologies and three major cancer panel-designs. Our method achieves an accuracy of 96% for RNA-seq and 95% for mixed DNA-seq and RNA-seq identification. Even for a panel of only 94 cancer-related genes, accuracy remains at 82% but decreases when using smaller panels.

In this ex vivo study of nine fresh human colon specimens, we report the first use of quantified subsurface scattering coefficient maps acquired by swept-source optical coherence tomography to reveal subsurface abnormities. We generate subsurface scattering coefficient maps with a novel wavelet-based-curve-fitting method that provides significantly improved accuracy. The angular spectra of scattering coefficient maps of normal tissues exhibit a spatial feature distinct from those of abnormal tissues. An angular spectrum index to quantify the differences between the normal and abnormal tissues is derived, and its strength in revealing subsurface cancer in ex vivo samples is statistically analyzed. The study demonstrates that the angular spectrum of the scattering coefficient map can effectively reveal subsurface colorectal cancer and potentially provide a fast and more accurate diagnosis. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Current options in palliation such as hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) present severe side effects. Recent research efforts suggested the therapeutic use of oxidant-enriched liquid using cold physical plasma. To investigate a clinically accepted treatment regimen, we assessed the antitumor capacity of plasma-treated saline solution. In response to such liquid, CT26 murine colon cancer cells were readily oxidized and showed cell growth with subsequent apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and upregulation of immunogenic cell death (ICD) markers in vitro. This was accompanied by marked morphological changes with re-arrangement of actin fibers and reduced motility. Induction of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype was not observed. Key results were confirmed in MC38 colon and PDA6606 pancreatic cancer cells. Compared to plasma-treated saline, hydrogen peroxide was inferiorly toxic in 3D tumor spheroids but of similar efficacy in 2D models. In vivo, plasma-treated saline decreased tumor burden in Balb/C mice. This was concomitant with elevated numbers of intratumoral macrophages and increased T cell activation following incubation with CT26 cells ex vivo. Being a potential adjuvant for HIPEC therapy, our results suggest oxidizing saline solutions to inactivate colon cancer cells while potentially stimulating antitumor immune responses. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Although solid fuel combustion emissions are known to increase the prevalence of illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer, however, their effect on the eyes is underexplored. This study assesses the acute toxicity of solid fuel combustion emissions on healthy ocular cells and a cancer cell line. Three healthy ocular cell lines (corneal, lens, and retinal epithelial cells) and a cancer cell line (Chinese hamster ovary cells) were exposed to liquid and gas phase emissions from applewood and coal combustion. Following the exposure, real-time cell attachment behavior was monitored for at least 120 hours with electrical cell impedance spectroscopy. The viability of the cells, amount of apoptotic cells, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were quantified with MTT, ApoTox-Glo, and ROS-Glo H 2 O 2 assays, respectively. The results showed that coal emissions compromised the viability of ocular cells more than applewood emissions. Interestingly, the cancer cells, although their viability was not compromised, generated 1.7 to 2.7 times more ROS than healthy cells. This acute exposure study provides compelling proof that biomass combustion emissions compromise the viability of ocular cells and increase ROS generation. The increased ROS generation was fatal for ocular cells, but it promoted the growth of cancer cells. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

The goal of this study was to classify mice with and without tumors and compare tumors localized to the mammary pad and tumor cells injected into the iliac artery by differences in VOCs in urine. After 4T1.2 tumor cells were injected into BALB/c mice either in the mammary pad or into the iliac artery, urine was collected, VOCs from urine headspace were concentrated by solid phase microextraction and results were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry quadrupole time-of-flight. Multivariate and univariate statistical analyses were employed to find potential biomarkers for breast cancer and metastatic breast cancer in mice models. A set of six VOCs classified mice with and without tumors with an area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC AUC) of 0.98 (95% confidence interval [0.85, 1.00]) via five-fold cross validation.

Moreover, the high drug loading capacity of Cet-SLN was employed to encapsulate photothermal agent indocyanine green (ICG) to finally fabricate a versatile drug delivery system (DDS) able to co-deliver Cet and ICG (Cet-SLN/ICG) for combinational chemo-photothermal therapy of breast cancer. The obtained results clearly demonstrated that Cet-SLN/ICG was well-dispersed nanoparticles with preferable stability under physiological condition. Furthermore, due to the conjugation of Cet, Cet-SLN/ICG could target EGFR which overexpress in MCF-7 cells. Most importantly, both in vitro and in vivo results suggested that compared with Cet or ICG alone, the Cet-SLN/ICG showed superior anticancer efficacy.

        fabio:abstract    "The integration of genomic and DNA methylation data has been demonstrated as a powerful strategy in understanding cancer mechanisms and identifying therapeutic targets. The TCGA consortium has mapped DNA methylation in thousands of cancer samples using Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 K BeadChip (Illumina 450 K array) that only covers about 1.5% of CpGs in the human genome. Therefore, increasing the coverage of the DNA methylome would significantly leverage the usage of the TCGA data. Here, we present a new model called EAGLING that can expand the Illumina 450 K array data 18 times to cover about 30% of the CpGs in the human genome. We applied it to analyze 13 cancers in TCGA. By integrating the expanded methylation, gene expression, and somatic mutation data, we identified the genes showing differential patterns in each of the 13 cancers. Many of the triple-evidenced genes identified in majority of the cancers are biomarkers or potential biomarkers. Pan-cancer analysis also revealed the pathways in which the triple-evidenced genes are enriched, which include well known ones as well as new ones, such as axonal guidance signaling pathway and pathways related to inflammatory processing or inflammation response. Triple-evidenced genes, particularly TNXB, RRM2, CELSR3, SLC16A3, FANCI, MMP9, MMP11, SIK1, and TRIM59 showed superior predictive power in both tumor diagnosis and prognosis. These results have demonstrated that the integrative analysis using the expanded methylation data is powerful in identifying critical genes/pathways that may serve as new therapeutic targets. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "A key challenge facing immunotherapy is poor infiltration of T cells into tumors, along with suppression of cells reaching these sites. However, macrophages make up a majority of immune cell infiltrates into tumors, creating natural targets for immunotherapies able to direct macrophages away from tumor-supportive functions and toward anti-tumor phenotypes. Recent studies demonstrate that toll-like receptors (TLRs) – pathways that quickly trigger early immune responses – play an important role in polarizing macrophages. Here, we present emerging ways in which TLR signaling is being manipulated in macrophages to create new opportunities for cancer immunotherapy. In particular, we discuss approaches to deliver TLR agonists, to leverage biomaterials in these therapies, and to couple TLR-based approaches with other frontline treatments as combination cancer therapies. © 2017" ;

However, immune checkpoint inhibitors are only advantageous for a limited population of cancer patients. Therefore, companion diagnostics are needed in order to identify patients for whom these therapies are effective. In the present study, we evaluated detailed immunological aspects in clinical specimens from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. We analyzed the immune profiles, T cell cytotoxicity, and TCR repertoire of peripheral blood, normal lung tissue, and tumor tissue from NSCLC patients. By using bispecific T-cell engager technology to assess the cytotoxicity of T cells, we found that the cytotoxicity of tumor-infiltrated T cells closely correlated with that of peripheral T cells. This correlation was supported by the immune profiles, cytokine production, and results of the TCR repertoire analysis from these specimens. We also found that the cytotoxicity of peripheral T cells has potential as a predictor of the effects of nivolumab in the tumor microenvironment. These results imply further applications to blood-based immune monitoring systems and predictive biomarkers for cancer immunotherapy. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

This standard procedure relies on the slow radioactivity loss, usually attributed to the limited tumour expression of G6P-phosphatase (G6Pase). However, this classical interpretation intrinsically represents an approximation since, as in all tissues, cancer G6Pase activity is remarkable and is confined to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whose lumen must be reached by phosphorylated FDG to explain its hydrolysis and radioactivity release. The present study tested the impact of G6Pase sequestration on the mathematical description of FDG trafficking and handling in cultured cancer cells. Our data show that accounting for tracer access to the ER configures this compartment as the preferential site of FDG accumulation. This is confirmed by the reticular localization of fluorescent FDG analogues. Remarkably enough, reticular accumulation rate of FDG is dependent upon extracellular glucose availability, thus configuring the same ER as a significant determinant of cancer glucose metabolism. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Although current methods of treatment for cervical cancer can ablate lesions, preventing metastatic disseminations and excessive tissue injuries still remains a major concern. Hence, development of a safer and more efficient treatment modality is of vital importance. Natural products from plants are one of the principal sources of precursors to lead compounds with direct pharmaceutical application across all disease classes. One of these plants is Ficus carica, whose fruit latex, when applied on HPV-induced skin warts, has shown potential as a possible cure for this virus related lesions. This study explores the in vitro biological activities of fig latex and elucidates its possible mechanisms of action on cervical cancer cell lines CaSki and HeLa positive for HPV type 16 and 18, respectively. Our data shows that fig latex inhibits properties that are associated with HPV-positive cervical cancer transformed cells such as rapid growth and invasion and substantially downregulated the expression of p16 and HPV onco-proteins E6, E7. These findings suggest Ficus carica latex has the potential to be used in the development of therapeutic modalities for the possible treatment, cure and prevention of HPV related cervical cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing methods, the diversity and composition of the microbiota from ovarian cancer tissues (25 samples) and normal distal fallopian tube tissues (25 samples) were analyzed. High-throughput sequencing showed that the diversity and richness indexes were significantly decreased in ovarian cancer tissues compared to tissues from normal distal fallopian tubes. The ratio of the two phyla for Proteobacteria/Firmicutes was notably increased in ovarian cancer, which revealed that microbial composition change might be associated with the process of ovarian cancer development. In addition, transcriptome-sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses suggested that the transcriptional profiles were statistically different between ovarian carcinoma and normal distal fallopian tubes. Moreover, a set of genes including 84 different inflammation-associated or immune-associated genes, which had been named as the human antibacterial-response genes were also modulated expression. Therefore, we hypothesize that the microbial composition change, as a novel risk factor, may be involving the initiation and progression of ovarian cancer via influencing and regulating the local immune microenvironment of fallopian tubes except for regular pathways. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Several pioneering work have established that apart from genetic alterations, epigenetic modifications contribute significantly in tumor progression. Remarkable role of EZH2 in cancer highlights the importance of identifying its targets. Although much emphasis has been placed in recent years in designing drugs and inhibitors targeting EZH2, less effort has been given in exploring its existing targets that will help in understanding the oncogenic role of EZH2 in turn which may provide a more stringent method of targeting EZH2. In the present study, we validated six direct targets of EZH2 that are GPNMB, PMEPA1, CoL5A1, VGLL4, POMT2 and SUMF1 associated with cancer related pathways. Upon EZH2 knockdown, more than two fold increase in the target gene expression was evident. CHIP-qPCR performed in both MCF-7 and MDA-MDA-231 confirmed the in-vivo binding of EZH2 on its identified target. Thirty invasive breast carcinoma cases with their adjacent normal tissues were included in the study. Immunohistochemistry in primary breast tumor tissue array showed tumor dependent expression of EZH2. Array of MERAV expression database revealed the strength of association of EZH2 with its target genes. Real time PCR performed with RNA extracted from breast tumor tissues further authenticated the existing negative correlation between EZH2 and its target genes. Pearson correlation coefficient & statistical significance computed using the matrix provided in the database strengthened the negative correlation between identified target genes and EZH2. KM plotter analysis showed improved relapse-free survival with increased expression of PMEPA1, POMT2, VGLL4 and SUMF1 in breast cancer patients indicating their therapeutic potential. While investigating the relevance of these target genes, different mutations of them were found in breast cancer patients. Seeking the clinical relevance of our study, following our recent publication that reports the role of EZH2 in nicotine-mediated breast cancer development and progression, we observed significant reduced expression of SUMF1 in breast cancer patient samples with smoking history in comparison to never-smoked patient samples. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we report that TOP1MT is overexpressed in cancer tissues and demonstrate that TOP1MT deficiency attenuates tumor growth in human and mouse models of colon and liver cancer. Due to their mitochondrial dysfunction, TOP1MT-KO cells become addicted to glycolysis, which limits synthetic building blocks and energy supply required for the proliferation of cancer cells in a nutrient-deprived tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, we show that TOP1MT associates with mitoribosomal subunits, ensuring optimal mitochondrial translation and assembly of oxidative phosphorylation complexes that are critical for sustaining tumor growth. The TOP1MT genomic signature profile, based on Top1mt-KO liver cancers, is correlated with enhanced survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients.

A new data integrative approach, based on graphical models, was applied on our multi-modal –omics, and clinical data cohort of metastatic melanoma patients. We found that response to chemotherapy is directly linked to ten gene expression, four methylation variables and PARP1 SNP rs1805407. PARP1 is a DNA repair gene critical for chemotherapy response and for which FDA-approved inhibitors are clinically available (olaparib). We demonstrated that two PARP inhibitors (ABT-888 and olaparib) make SNP carrier cancer cells of various histologic subtypes more sensitive to alkylating agents, but they have no effect in wild-type cells. Furthermore, PARP1 inhibitors act synergistically with chemotherapy in SNP carrier cells (especially in ovarian cancer for which olaparib is FDA-approved), but they are additive at best in wild-type cancer cells. Taken together, our results suggest that the combination of chemotherapy and PARP1 inhibition may benefit the carriers of rs1805407 in the future and may be used in personalized therapy strategies to select patients that are more likely to respond to PARP inhibitors. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Earlier studies have shown that bovine α -lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells (BAMLET) becomes cytotoxic against cancer cells in complex with oleic acid {Hoque, M. et. al., PLoSOne8, e68390 (2013)}. In our study, we obtained bovine α-lactalbumin complexed with lanthanum ion (La 3+ -B-α-LA) and determined its high resolution crystal structure. The natural calcium binding site of bovine α-lactalbumin is replaced by lanthanum. The La 3+ complex formation by B-α-apo-LA was also supported by various biophysical methods. Interestingly, our complex, La 3+ -B-α-LA exhibits much greater anticancer activity against breast cancer cells as compared to the reported BAMLET-oleic acid complex. This study shows that La 3+ -B-α-LA complex is preferentially more toxic to MCF-7 cells as compared to KB (oral cancer) and HeLa (cervical) cells, while almost non-toxic to the healthy cells that we studied. Our data indicates that the cytotoxicity of La 3+ -B-α-LA against cancer cells is through apoptotic path way. The higher anticancer activity of La 3+ -B-α-LA is attributable to the requisite structural changes induced in the protein by La 3+ binding as supported by the crystal structure of the complex. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

However, no studies have evaluated vascular pain in patients with colorectal cancer in relation to peripheral venous administration of chemotherapy with or without oxaliplatin. We evaluated oxaliplatin-induced vascular pain using subjective and objective methods. We determined if oxaliplatin induced vascular pain in patients with colorectal cancer using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and a PainVision PS-2100 device. We compared VAS score between chemotherapy regimens with or without oxaliplatin, and between genders. We also examined the correlations of VAS score with pain intensity examined by the PainVision PS-2100, and with age and vessel diameter. A total of 98 patients with colorectal cancer were enrolled in this study, including 78 patients who received oxaliplatin via peripheral venous administration and 20 who received chemotherapy without oxaliplatin. The median VAS scores in patients with and without oxaliplatin were 36.5 (interquartile range 9.0–60.0) and 0 (0–4.0), respectively (P < 0.001), and the median pain intensities according to PainVision were 43.5 (14.3–98) and 36.5 (9.3–58.5), respectively (P < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between VAS and pain intensity (r = 0.584), but no correlation between VAS score and age (r = −0.174) or vessel diameter (r = −0.107). Peripheral venous administration of oxaliplatin induced vascular pain, measured both subjectively and objectively, in patients with colorectal cancer, regardless of vessel diameter. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Primary bronchial cancer accounts for almost 20% of all cancer death worldwide. One of the emerging techniques with tremendous power for lung cancer therapy is magnetic aerosol drug targeting (MADT). The use of a permanent magnet for effective drug delivery in a desired location throughout the lung requires extensive optimization, but it has not been addressed yet. In the present study, the possibility of using a permanent magnet for trapping the particles on a lung tumor is evaluated numerically in the Weibel's model from G0 to G3. The effect of different parameters is considered on the efficiency of particle deposition in a tumor located on a distant position of the lung bronchi and bronchioles. Also, the effective position of the magnetic source, tumor size, and location are the objectives for particle deposition. The results show that a limited particle deposition occurs on the lung branches in passive targeting. However, the incorporation of a permanent magnet next to the tumor enhanced the particle deposition fraction on G2 to up to 49% for the particles of 7 µm diameter. Optimizing the magnet size could also improve the particle deposition fraction by 68%. It was also shown that the utilization of MADT is essential for effective drug delivery to the tumors located on the lower wall of airway branches given the dominance of the air velocity and resultant drag force in this region. The results demonstrated the high competence and necessity of MADT as a noninvasive drug delivery method for lung cancer therapy." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. Adjuvant chemotherapy has significantly reduced mortality but increased cognitive impairments, including attention function, making quality of life issues a crucial concern. This study enrolled nineteen breast cancer patients who were treated with standard chemotherapy within 6 months and 20 sex-matched healthy controls to investigate the brain effects of chemotherapy. All participants underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) with mean fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (mfALFF) analysis and were correlated with neuropsychological tests, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised (CAMS-R), and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), to explore the possible underlying mechanism of cognitive alternations. We found increased mfALFF over the frontoparietal lobe and decreased mfALFF over the occipital lobe in the cancer patients compared with the healthy controls; the altered brain regions may be associated with the dorsal attention network (DAN) and may be explained by a compensatory mechanism. Both MMSE and CAMS-R scores showed a positive correlation with mfALFF in the occipital lobe but a negative correlation in the frontoparietal lobe. By contrast, IES-R scores showed a positive correlation with mfALFF in the frontoparietal lobe but a negative correlation in the occipital lobe. These alterations are potentially related to the effects of both chemotherapy and psychological distress. Future research involving a larger sample size of patients with breast cancer is recommended. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

In the case of mutations in individual genes that cause them to be incorrectly spliced, engineered splicing factors can be introduced to correct splicing of these aberrant transcripts and reduce the effects of the disease phenotype. Mutations that occur in certain splicing factor genes themselves have been implicated in many cancers, particularly myelodysplastic syndromes. Small molecules that target splicing factors have been developed as therapies to preferentially induce apoptosis in these cancer cells. Specifically, drugs targeting the splicing factor SF3B1 have led to recent clinical trials.

Analysis of AA-reconstructed amplicons in a pan-cancer dataset reveals many novel properties of copy number amplifications in cancer. These findings support a model in which focal amplifications arise due to the formation and replication of extrachromosomal DNA. Applying AA to 68 viral-mediated cancer samples, we identify a large fraction of amplicons with specific structural signatures suggestive of hybrid, human-viral extrachromosomal DNA.

There have been many attempts to identify markers and key pathways induced throughout EMT but the process is complex and depends on the cancer type and tumour microenvironment. Here we used the colon cancer cell line HT29, which stably overexpressed Snail, the key transcription factor in early EMT, as a model for colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with a pro-metastatic phenotype. We investigated miRNA expression regulation during that phenotypic switching. We found that overexpression of Snail in HT29 cells triggered significant changes in individual miRNA levels but did not change the global efficiency of miRNA processing. Snail abundance repressed the expression of miR-192 and miR-194 and increased miR-205, let-7i and SNORD13 levels. These identified changes correlated with the reported transcriptomic alterations in Snail-overexpressing HT29 cells. We also investigated how Snail affected the miRNA content of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from HT29 cells. Our data suggest that the presence of Snail significantly alters the complex mRNA/miRNA interactions in the early steps of metastasis and also has an impact on the content of EVs released from HT29 cells. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

This retrospective case-control study compared patients who had lung cancer with PJP (n = 112) or without PJP (n = 336) matched according to age, sex, histopathology, and stage. PJP definition was based on (i) positive PCR or direct immunofluorescence results for pneumocystis, (ii) clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities that were consistent with a pneumonic process, and (iii) received targeted PJP treatment. The development of PJP was associated with radiotherapy (RTx), concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRTx), lymphopenia, and prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (20 mg of prednisolone equivalent per day for ≥3 weeks). Multivariate analysis revealed independent associations with prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06–3.63; p = 0.032) and CCRTx (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.27–3.43; p = 0.004). Steroid use was frequently related to RTx pneumonitis or esophagitis (29 patients, 43.3%). Prolonged high-dose steroid therapy and CCRTx were risk factors for PJP development among patients with lung cancer. As these patients had a poor prognosis, clinicians should consider PJP prophylaxis for high-risk patients with lung cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

We performed an in silico analysis to determine the concordance in the frequencies of actionable mutations and copy number alterations/aberrations (CNAs) in the two most common breast cancer histologies, invasive lobular and invasive ductal carcinoma. We found that targeted sequencing identified a larger number of mutational hotspots and clinically significant amplifications that would have been missed by WES and SNP arrays in many actionable genes such as PIK3CA, EGFR, AKT3, FGFR1, ERBB2, ERBB3 and ESR1. The striking differences between the number of mutational hotspots and CNAs generated from these platforms highlight a number of factors that should be considered in the interpretation of array and NGS-based genomic data for precision medicine.

Several oxaliplatin transporters were previously identified but their relative contributions to determining oxaliplatin tumour responses and gastrointestinal tumour cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin remains unclear. We studied clinical associations between tumour expression of oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes and patient response to oxaliplatin, then experimentally verified associations found with MRP2 in models of human gastrointestinal cancer. Among 18 oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes, MRP2 was the only one to be differentially expressed in the tumours of colorectal cancer patients who did or did not respond to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Over-expression of MRP2 (endogenously in HepG2 and PANC-1 cells, or induced by stable transfection of HEK293 cells) decreased oxaliplatin accumulation and cytotoxicity but those deficits were reversed by inhibition of MRP2 with myricetin or siRNA knockdown. Mice bearing subcutaneous HepG2 tumour xenografts were sensitised to oxaliplatin antitumour activity by concurrent myricetin treatment with little or no increase in toxicity. In conclusion, MRP2 limits oxaliplatin accumulation and response in human gastrointestinal cancer.

We compare optimized gene signatures for cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin responses in the same cell lines and validate each signature using data from patients with cancer. Supervised support vector machine learning is used to derive gene sets whose expression is related to the cell line GI50 values by backwards feature selection with cross-validation. Specific genes and functional pathways distinguishing sensitive from resistant cell lines are identified by contrasting signatures obtained at extreme and median GI50 thresholds. Ensembles of gene signatures at different thresholds are combined to reduce the dependence on specific GI50 values for predicting drug responses. The most accurate gene signatures for each platin are: cisplatin: BARD1, BCL2, BCL2L1, CDKN2C, FAAP24, FEN1, MAP3K1, MAPK13, MAPK3, NFKB1, NFKB2, SLC22A5, SLC31A2, TLR4, and TWIST1; carboplatin: AKT1, EIF3K, ERCC1, GNGT1, GSR, MTHFR, NEDD4L, NLRP1, NRAS, RAF1, SGK1, TIGD1, TP53, VEGFB, and VEGFC; and oxaliplatin: BRAF, FCGR2A, IGF1, MSH2, NAGK, NFE2L2, NQO1, PANK3, SLC47A1, SLCO1B1, and UGT1A1. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with bladder, ovarian, and colorectal cancer were used to test the cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin signatures, resulting in 71.0%, 60.2%, and 54.5% accuracies in predicting disease recurrence and 59%, 61%, and 72% accuracies in predicting remission, respectively. One cisplatin signature predicted 100% of recurrence in non-smoking patients with bladder cancer (57% disease-free; N = 19), and 79% recurrence in smokers (62% disease-free; N = 35).

MTH1 dephosphorylates oxidized nucleotides, thereby preventing their incorporation into DNA and protecting tumour cells from oxidative DNA damage. Inhibitors of MTH1 (TH588 and (S)-crizotinib) were shown to reduce cancer cell viability. However, the MTH1-dependency of the anti-cancer effects of these drugs has recently been questioned. Here, we have assessed anti-tumour effects of TH588 and (S)-crizotinib in patient-derived 3D colorectal cancer cultures. Hypoxia and reoxygenation – conditions that increase intracellular ROS levels – increased sensitivity to (S)-crizotinib, but not to TH588. (S)-crizotinib reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-MET and ErbB3 whereas TH588 induced a mitotic cell cycle arrest, which was not affected by adding ROS-modulating compounds. Furthermore, we show that both compounds induced DNA damage that could not be prevented by adding the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Moreover, adding ROS-modulating compounds did not alter the reduction in viability in response to TH588 and (S)-crizotinib. We conclude that TH588 and (S)-crizotinib have very clear and distinct anti-tumour effects in 3D colorectal cancer cultures, but that these effects most likely occur through distinct and ROS-independent mechanisms. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Iron deposits are a phenotypic trait of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Histological iron imaging and contrast-agent free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect these deposits, but their presence in human cancer, and correlation with immunotherapeutic response is largely untested. Here, primarily using these iron imaging approaches, we evaluated the spatial distribution of polarized macrophage populations containing high endogenous levels of iron in preclinical murine models and human breast cancer, and used them as metabolic biomarkers to correlate TAM infiltration with response to immunotherapy in preclinical trials. Macrophage-targeted inhibition of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) by immunotherapy was confirmed to inhibit macrophage accumulation and slow mammary tumor growth in mouse models while also reducing hemosiderin iron-laden TAM accumulation as measured by both iron histology and in vivo iron MRI (FeMRI). Spatial profiling of TAM iron deposit infiltration defined regions of maximal accumulation and response to the CSF1R inhibitor, and revealed differences between microenvironments of human cancer according to levels of polarized macrophage iron accumulation in stromal margins. We therefore demonstrate that iron deposition serves as an endogenous metabolic imaging biomarker of TAM infiltration in breast cancer that has high translational potential for evaluation of immunotherapeutic response. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "More than 50% of colon cancers bear mutations in p53, one of the most important tumor suppressors, and its family members p63 or p73 are expected to contribute to inhibiting the progression of colon cancers. The AP2 family also acts as a tumor suppressor. Here we found that p73 and AP2 are able to activate NEU4, a neuraminidase gene, which removes the terminal sialic acid residues from cancer-associated glycans. Under serum starvation, NEU4 was up-regulated and one of the NEU4 target glycans, sialyl Lewis X, was decreased, whereas p73 and AP2 were up-regulated. Sialyl Lewis X levels were not, however, decreased under starvation conditions in p73- or AP2-knockdown cells. p53 and AP2 underwent protein-protein interactions, exerting synergistic effects to activate p21, and interaction of p53 with AP2 was lost in cells expressing the L350P mutation of p53. The homologous residues in p63 and p73 are L423 and L377, respectively. The synergistic effect of p53/p63 with AP2 to activate genes was lost with the L350P/L423P mutation in p53/p63, but p73 bearing the L377P mutation was able to interact with AP2 and exerted its normal synergistic effects. We propose that p73 and AP2 synergistically activate the NEU4 promoter in colon cancer cells. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Nanoparticles prepared by single emulsion method had a size of less than 300 nm with 70.7 ± 3.9% reaction yield and 26.4 ± 1.1% Hsp loading capacity. Treatment of C6 glioma cells with HspNPs for 24 and 48 h resulted in dose- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability, with approximate IC50 of 28 and 21 μg/mL, respectively (p = .036 for 24 h, p = .025 for 48 h). The percentage of PCNA positive cells decreased to 20% and 10%, respectively, for Hsp- and HspNP-treated cells at concentration of 100 µg/mL. Treatment with increasing concentrations of HspNPs (25, 50, 75 and 100 µg/mL) resulted in 9.1-, 7-, 12.5- and 12.7-fold in increase in apoptotic cell number. Optimum doses of Hsp and HspNPs were found to increase oxidative damage in C6 glioma cells. MDA levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were found to be significantly elevated at 75 and 100 µg/mL exposure concentration of HspNPs with (p = .002) and (p = .018), respectively for 48-h treatment. The results obtained with this study showed biocompatible polymeric nanoparticle systems has great advantages to enhance anti-cancer activity and poor solubility of therapeutic agents. Overall our findings suggest that Hsp-loaded PLGA nanoparticle systems showed significant anti-cancer activity and HspNPs could be used as promising novel anti-cancer agent." ;

GO exhibits pH-dependent fluorescence emission in the visible/near-infrared, providing a possibility of molecular imaging and pH-sensing. It is also water soluble and has a substantial platform for functionalization, allowing for the delivery of multiple therapeutics. GO physical properties are modified to enhance cellular internalization, producing fluorescent nanoflakes with low (<15%) cytotoxicity at the imaging concentrations of 15 μg/mL. As a result, at lower flake sizes GO rapidly internalizes into HeLa cells with the following 70% fluorescence based clearance at 24 h, assessed by its characteristic emission in red/near-IR. pH-dependence of GO emission is utilized to provide the sensing of acidic extracellular environments of cancer cells. The results demonstrate diminishing green/red (550/630 nm) fluorescence intensity ratios for HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells in comparison to HEK-293 healthy cells suggesting a potential use of GO as a non-invasive optical sensor for cancer microenvironments.

There have been many attempts to identify markers and key pathways induced throughout EMT but the process is complex and depends on the cancer type and tumour microenvironment. Here we used the colon cancer cell line HT29, which stably overexpressed Snail, the key transcription factor in early EMT, as a model for colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with a pro-metastatic phenotype. We investigated miRNA expression regulation during that phenotypic switching. We found that overexpression of Snail in HT29 cells triggered significant changes in individual miRNA levels but did not change the global efficiency of miRNA processing. Snail abundance repressed the expression of miR-192 and miR-194 and increased miR-205, let-7i and SNORD13 levels. These identified changes correlated with the reported transcriptomic alterations in Snail-overexpressing HT29 cells. We also investigated how Snail affected the miRNA content of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from HT29 cells. Our data suggest that the presence of Snail significantly alters the complex mRNA/miRNA interactions in the early steps of metastasis and also has an impact on the content of EVs released from HT29 cells. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

This retrospective case-control study compared patients who had lung cancer with PJP (n = 112) or without PJP (n = 336) matched according to age, sex, histopathology, and stage. PJP definition was based on (i) positive PCR or direct immunofluorescence results for pneumocystis, (ii) clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities that were consistent with a pneumonic process, and (iii) received targeted PJP treatment. The development of PJP was associated with radiotherapy (RTx), concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRTx), lymphopenia, and prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (20 mg of prednisolone equivalent per day for ≥3 weeks). Multivariate analysis revealed independent associations with prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06–3.63; p = 0.032) and CCRTx (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.27–3.43; p = 0.004). Steroid use was frequently related to RTx pneumonitis or esophagitis (29 patients, 43.3%). Prolonged high-dose steroid therapy and CCRTx were risk factors for PJP development among patients with lung cancer. As these patients had a poor prognosis, clinicians should consider PJP prophylaxis for high-risk patients with lung cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

We performed an in silico analysis to determine the concordance in the frequencies of actionable mutations and copy number alterations/aberrations (CNAs) in the two most common breast cancer histologies, invasive lobular and invasive ductal carcinoma. We found that targeted sequencing identified a larger number of mutational hotspots and clinically significant amplifications that would have been missed by WES and SNP arrays in many actionable genes such as PIK3CA, EGFR, AKT3, FGFR1, ERBB2, ERBB3 and ESR1. The striking differences between the number of mutational hotspots and CNAs generated from these platforms highlight a number of factors that should be considered in the interpretation of array and NGS-based genomic data for precision medicine.

Several oxaliplatin transporters were previously identified but their relative contributions to determining oxaliplatin tumour responses and gastrointestinal tumour cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin remains unclear. We studied clinical associations between tumour expression of oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes and patient response to oxaliplatin, then experimentally verified associations found with MRP2 in models of human gastrointestinal cancer. Among 18 oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes, MRP2 was the only one to be differentially expressed in the tumours of colorectal cancer patients who did or did not respond to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Over-expression of MRP2 (endogenously in HepG2 and PANC-1 cells, or induced by stable transfection of HEK293 cells) decreased oxaliplatin accumulation and cytotoxicity but those deficits were reversed by inhibition of MRP2 with myricetin or siRNA knockdown. Mice bearing subcutaneous HepG2 tumour xenografts were sensitised to oxaliplatin antitumour activity by concurrent myricetin treatment with little or no increase in toxicity. In conclusion, MRP2 limits oxaliplatin accumulation and response in human gastrointestinal cancer.

We compare optimized gene signatures for cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin responses in the same cell lines and validate each signature using data from patients with cancer. Supervised support vector machine learning is used to derive gene sets whose expression is related to the cell line GI50 values by backwards feature selection with cross-validation. Specific genes and functional pathways distinguishing sensitive from resistant cell lines are identified by contrasting signatures obtained at extreme and median GI50 thresholds. Ensembles of gene signatures at different thresholds are combined to reduce the dependence on specific GI50 values for predicting drug responses. The most accurate gene signatures for each platin are: cisplatin: BARD1, BCL2, BCL2L1, CDKN2C, FAAP24, FEN1, MAP3K1, MAPK13, MAPK3, NFKB1, NFKB2, SLC22A5, SLC31A2, TLR4, and TWIST1; carboplatin: AKT1, EIF3K, ERCC1, GNGT1, GSR, MTHFR, NEDD4L, NLRP1, NRAS, RAF1, SGK1, TIGD1, TP53, VEGFB, and VEGFC; and oxaliplatin: BRAF, FCGR2A, IGF1, MSH2, NAGK, NFE2L2, NQO1, PANK3, SLC47A1, SLCO1B1, and UGT1A1. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with bladder, ovarian, and colorectal cancer were used to test the cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin signatures, resulting in 71.0%, 60.2%, and 54.5% accuracies in predicting disease recurrence and 59%, 61%, and 72% accuracies in predicting remission, respectively. One cisplatin signature predicted 100% of recurrence in non-smoking patients with bladder cancer (57% disease-free; N = 19), and 79% recurrence in smokers (62% disease-free; N = 35).

MTH1 dephosphorylates oxidized nucleotides, thereby preventing their incorporation into DNA and protecting tumour cells from oxidative DNA damage. Inhibitors of MTH1 (TH588 and (S)-crizotinib) were shown to reduce cancer cell viability. However, the MTH1-dependency of the anti-cancer effects of these drugs has recently been questioned. Here, we have assessed anti-tumour effects of TH588 and (S)-crizotinib in patient-derived 3D colorectal cancer cultures. Hypoxia and reoxygenation – conditions that increase intracellular ROS levels – increased sensitivity to (S)-crizotinib, but not to TH588. (S)-crizotinib reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-MET and ErbB3 whereas TH588 induced a mitotic cell cycle arrest, which was not affected by adding ROS-modulating compounds. Furthermore, we show that both compounds induced DNA damage that could not be prevented by adding the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Moreover, adding ROS-modulating compounds did not alter the reduction in viability in response to TH588 and (S)-crizotinib. We conclude that TH588 and (S)-crizotinib have very clear and distinct anti-tumour effects in 3D colorectal cancer cultures, but that these effects most likely occur through distinct and ROS-independent mechanisms. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Iron deposits are a phenotypic trait of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Histological iron imaging and contrast-agent free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect these deposits, but their presence in human cancer, and correlation with immunotherapeutic response is largely untested. Here, primarily using these iron imaging approaches, we evaluated the spatial distribution of polarized macrophage populations containing high endogenous levels of iron in preclinical murine models and human breast cancer, and used them as metabolic biomarkers to correlate TAM infiltration with response to immunotherapy in preclinical trials. Macrophage-targeted inhibition of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) by immunotherapy was confirmed to inhibit macrophage accumulation and slow mammary tumor growth in mouse models while also reducing hemosiderin iron-laden TAM accumulation as measured by both iron histology and in vivo iron MRI (FeMRI). Spatial profiling of TAM iron deposit infiltration defined regions of maximal accumulation and response to the CSF1R inhibitor, and revealed differences between microenvironments of human cancer according to levels of polarized macrophage iron accumulation in stromal margins. We therefore demonstrate that iron deposition serves as an endogenous metabolic imaging biomarker of TAM infiltration in breast cancer that has high translational potential for evaluation of immunotherapeutic response. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

The AP2 family also acts as a tumor suppressor. Here we found that p73 and AP2 are able to activate NEU4, a neuraminidase gene, which removes the terminal sialic acid residues from cancer-associated glycans. Under serum starvation, NEU4 was up-regulated and one of the NEU4 target glycans, sialyl Lewis X, was decreased, whereas p73 and AP2 were up-regulated. Sialyl Lewis X levels were not, however, decreased under starvation conditions in p73- or AP2-knockdown cells. p53 and AP2 underwent protein-protein interactions, exerting synergistic effects to activate p21, and interaction of p53 with AP2 was lost in cells expressing the L350P mutation of p53. The homologous residues in p63 and p73 are L423 and L377, respectively. The synergistic effect of p53/p63 with AP2 to activate genes was lost with the L350P/L423P mutation in p53/p63, but p73 bearing the L377P mutation was able to interact with AP2 and exerted its normal synergistic effects. We propose that p73 and AP2 synergistically activate the NEU4 promoter in colon cancer cells. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Nanoparticles prepared by single emulsion method had a size of less than 300 nm with 70.7 ± 3.9% reaction yield and 26.4 ± 1.1% Hsp loading capacity. Treatment of C6 glioma cells with HspNPs for 24 and 48 h resulted in dose- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability, with approximate IC50 of 28 and 21 μg/mL, respectively (p = .036 for 24 h, p = .025 for 48 h). The percentage of PCNA positive cells decreased to 20% and 10%, respectively, for Hsp- and HspNP-treated cells at concentration of 100 µg/mL. Treatment with increasing concentrations of HspNPs (25, 50, 75 and 100 µg/mL) resulted in 9.1-, 7-, 12.5- and 12.7-fold in increase in apoptotic cell number. Optimum doses of Hsp and HspNPs were found to increase oxidative damage in C6 glioma cells. MDA levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were found to be significantly elevated at 75 and 100 µg/mL exposure concentration of HspNPs with (p = .002) and (p = .018), respectively for 48-h treatment. The results obtained with this study showed biocompatible polymeric nanoparticle systems has great advantages to enhance anti-cancer activity and poor solubility of therapeutic agents.

GO exhibits pH-dependent fluorescence emission in the visible/near-infrared, providing a possibility of molecular imaging and pH-sensing. It is also water soluble and has a substantial platform for functionalization, allowing for the delivery of multiple therapeutics. GO physical properties are modified to enhance cellular internalization, producing fluorescent nanoflakes with low (<15%) cytotoxicity at the imaging concentrations of 15 μg/mL. As a result, at lower flake sizes GO rapidly internalizes into HeLa cells with the following 70% fluorescence based clearance at 24 h, assessed by its characteristic emission in red/near-IR. pH-dependence of GO emission is utilized to provide the sensing of acidic extracellular environments of cancer cells. The results demonstrate diminishing green/red (550/630 nm) fluorescence intensity ratios for HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells in comparison to HEK-293 healthy cells suggesting a potential use of GO as a non-invasive optical sensor for cancer microenvironments.

Patients with primary cervical cancer and newly diagnosed were selected from ten different cancer specialist hospitals of Malaysia. Patients’ demographic and clinical data were obtained for the prognostic analysis. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate patients’ survival time (CSS and OS) with DM status and values were compared using the log-rank test. A total of 19,785 newly diagnosed CC patients were registered during 2010–2016, among them only 16,946 (85.6%) with primary CC tumor. There was no difference in treatment modality between DM and non-DM patients. However intergroup assessment showed that type 2DM have significantly higher rate of mortality in both overall mortality (28.3%) and CC-specific (11.7%) as compared to Type 1DM (17.3%; 5.5%) and non DM patients (12.7%; 9.1%) (p < 0.001). Within group assessments showed that Type 2DM patients have better quality of life (mean 7.13 ± 3.67) (p < 0.001) and less distress levels (mean 2.41 ± 0.63) (p < 0.011) as compared to type1 DM (meant 10.54 ± 2.11; 3.19 ± 1.07).

In order to tackle cancer heterogeneity and comply with the data dimensionality, a number of network and pathway approaches were invented but rarely systematically applied to this task. We propose a new method, called NEAmarker, for finding sensitive and robust biomarkers at the pathway level. scores from network enrichment analysis transform the original space of altered genes into a lower-dimensional space of pathways. These dimensions are then correlated with phenotype variables. The method was first tested using in vitro data from three anti-cancer drug screens and then on clinical data of The Cancer Genome Atlas. It proved superior to the single-gene and alternative enrichment analyses in terms of (1) universal applicability to different data types with a possibility of cross-platform integration, (2) consistency of the discovered correlates between independent drug screens, and (3) ability to explain differential survival of treated patients. Our new screen of anti-cancer compounds validated the performance of multivariate models of drug sensitivity. The previously proposed methods of enrichment analysis could achieve comparable levels of performance in certain tests. However, only our method could discover predictors of both in vitro response and patient survival given administration of the same drug. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

SPIONs entrapped in the core of the nanocomplex may act as a hyperthermia agent and generate localized heat upon excitation with an alternating magnetic field (AMF), thus enabling a thermo-chemotherapy strategy for cancer treatment. Accordingly, the cytotoxic effect and the mode of cell death triggered by the nanocomplex in combination with AMF were evaluated on two different cancer cell lines with various folate receptor (FR) expression levels, including KB nasopharyngeal cancer cells overexpressing FRs as the model and MCF-7 breast cancer cells with low level of FRs as the blank sample. The obtained results showed that KB cell death was greater than the cell death observed in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, a majority of cell death in both cell lines were related to apoptosis when the folate-modified nanocomplex was used instated of the non-folate-modified nanocomplex. Therefore, functionalizing the nanocomplex with folate modulated the response to thermo-chemotherapy by shifting the cell death pathways toward apoptosis." ;

This cohort study included 128 HER2-positive breast cancer who received NAC with trastuzumab. TILs grading of the tumor stroma in pretreatment biopsy specimens and residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab was categorized as low, intermediate, and high based on the criteria of the International Working Group. In current study, the pCR rate was 64.8%, and the Relapse-free survival (RFS) was significantly worse in the non-pCR group than in the pCR group. The pCR rate correlated with the TILs grade in pretreatment tumors. In 45 non-pCR patients, TILs grade was higher in the residual tumors than in the pretreatment tumors. The RFS was significantly better in residual tumors with high TILs grade than those with low TILs grade (p = 0.033). In conclusion, assessment of the TILs grade in residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab might be necessary to determine patients with good prognosis among those who do not achieve pCR. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Most targeting strategies of anticancer drug delivery systems (DDSs) rely on the surface functionalization of nanocarriers with specific ligands, which trigger the internalization in cancer cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The endocytosis implies the entrapment of DDSs in acidic vesicles (endosomes and lysosomes) and their eventual ejection by exocytosis. This process, intrinsic to eukaryotic cells, is one of the main drawbacks of DDSs because it reduces the drug bioavailability in the intracellular environment. The escape of DDSs from the acidic vesicles is, therefore, crucial to enhance the therapeutic performance at low drug dose. To this end, we developed a multifunctionalized DDS that combines high specificity towards cancer cells with endosomal escape capabilities. Doxorubicin-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles were functionalized with polyethylenimine, a polymer commonly used to induce endosomal rupture, and hyaluronic acid, which binds to CD44 receptors, overexpressed in cancer cells. We show irrefutable proof that the developed DDS can escape the endosomal pathway upon polymeric functionalization. Interestingly, the combination of the two polymers resulted in higher endosomal escape efficiency than the polyethylenimine coating alone. Hyaluronic acid additionally provides the system with cancer targeting capability and enzymatically controlled drug release. Thanks to this multifunctionality, the engineered DDS had cytotoxicity comparable to the pure drug whilst displaying high specificity towards cancer cells. The polymeric engineering here developed enhances the performance of DDS at low drug dose, holding great potential for anticancer therapeutic applications. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The use of oncolytic viruses (OVs) for cancer treatment is emerging as a successful strategy that combines the direct, targeted killing of the cancer with the induction of a long-lasting anti-tumor immune response. Using multiple aggressive murine models of triple-negative breast cancer, we have recently demonstrated that the early administration of oncolytic Maraba virus (MRB) prior to surgical resection of the primary tumor is sufficient to minimize the metastatic burden, protect against tumor rechallenge, cure a fraction of the mice and sensitize refractory tumors to immune checkpoint blockade without the need for further treatment. Here, we apply our surgical model to other OVs: Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Adenovirus (Ad), Reovirus (Reo) and Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and show that all of the tested OVs could positively change the outcome of the treated animals. The growth of the primary and secondary tumors was differently affected by the various OVs and most of the viruses conferred survival benefits in this neoadjuvant setting despite the absence of direct treatment following rechallenge. This study establishes that OV-therapy confers long-term protection when administered in the pre-operative window of opportunity. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase is overexpressed in approximately 15–20% of breast tumors and associated with aggressive disease and poor clinical outcome. p130Cas represents a nodal scaffold protein regulating cell survival, migration and proliferation in normal and pathological contexts. p130Cas overexpression in ErbB2 human breast cancer correlates with poor prognosis and metastasis formation. Recent data indicate that p130Cas association to ErbB2 protects ErbB2 from degradation, thus enhancing tumorigenesis. Therefore, inhibiting p130Cas/ErbB2 interaction might represent a new therapeutic strategy to target breast cancer. Here we demonstrate by performing Molecular Modeling, Molecular Dynamics, dot blot, ELISA and fluorescence quenching experiments, that p130Cas binds directly to ErbB2. Then, by structure-based virtual screening, we identified two potential inhibitors of p130Cas/ErbB2 interaction. Their experimental validation was performed in vitro and in ErbB2-positive breast cancer cellular models. The results highlight that both compounds interfere with p130Cas/ErbB2 binding and significantly affect cell proliferation and sensitivity to Trastuzumab. Overall, this study identifies p130Cas/ErbB2 complex as a potential breast cancer target revealing new therapeutic perspectives for protein-protein interaction (PPI). © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Gastric cancer (GC) ranks as the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, and approximately 42% of all cases diagnosed each year worldwide are diagnosed in China. A large number of clinical applications have revealed that Trametes robiniophila Μurr. (Huaier) exhibits an anti-tumour effect. However, loss of the bioactive components of Huaier during the extraction procedure with water is unavoidable, and the underlying mechanism of the anti-cancer effect of Huaier remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer effect of Huaier n-butanol extract, which contained 51.4% total flavonoids, on HGC27, MGC803, and AGS human GC cell lines in vitro. At a low concentration, Huaier n-butanol extract inhibited the growth of these GC cell types, induced cell cycle arrest and reduced cell metastasis. Moreover, Huaier n-butanol extract suppressed the c-Myc-Bmi1 signalling pathway, and overexpression of Bmi1 reversed the effects of Huaier n-butanol extract on GC cells. Thus, our findings indicate that Huaier n-butanol extract suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of GC cells via a c-Myc-Bmi1-mediated approach, providing a new perspective for our understanding of the anti-tumour effects of Huaier. These results suggest that Huaier n-butanol extract could be an attractive therapeutic adjuvant for the treatment of human GC. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

In the present study, we screened the anticancer potential of supernatant metabolites from eight native haloarchaeal strains obtained from a culture collection in Iran. Five human cancer cell lines including breast, lung, prostate and also human fibroblast cells as the normal control were used in the present study. Moreover, to evaluate the anti-tumor effect of the selected supernatant, inhibition of sphere formation and tumor development was assessed in-vitro and in-vivo, respectively. Among all strains, supernatant metabolites from Halobacterium salinarum IBRC M10715 had the most potent cytotoxic effect on prostate cancer cell lines (IC50 = 0.5 mg/mL) without any effects on normal cells. It significantly increased both early and late apoptosis (about 11% and 9%, respectively) in the androgen-dependent PC3 cell line, reduced sphere formation ability of DU145 and PC3 cells with down-regulation of SOX2 gene expression. Furthermore, our results revealed that tumors developed in nude mice significantly shrank post intratumor injection of metabolites of the haloarchaeal strain. In conclusion, we suggested here for the first time that supernatant metabolites from Halobacterium salinarum IBRC M10715 could be a novel component against prostate cancer in-vitro and in-vivo with remarkable reduction in stem-like properties of tumor. © 2017, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

The main HNSCC risk factors are tobacco, excessive alcohol use, and the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV positive (+) cancers are etiologically different from other HNSCC and often show better prognosis. The current knowledge regarding HNSCC miRNA profiles is still incomplete especially in the context of HPV+ cancer. Thus, we analyzed 61 freshly collected primary oral (OSCC) and oropharyngeal (OPSCC) SCC samples. HPV DNA and RNA was found in 21% cases. The Illumina whole-genome small-RNA profiling by next-generation sequencing was done on 22 samples and revealed 7 specific miRNAs to HPV+ OSCC, 77 to HPV+ OPSCC, and additional 3 shared with both; 51 miRNAs were specific to HPV− OPSCC, 62 to HPV− OSCC, and 31 shared with both. The results for 9 miRNAs (miR-9, -21, -29a, -100, -106b, -143 and -145) were assessed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction on the whole study population. The data was additionally confirmed by reanalyzing publicly available miRNA sequencing Cancer Genome Atlas consortium (TCGA) HNSCC data. Cell signaling pathway analysis revealed differences between HPV+ and HPV− HNSCC. Our findings compared with literature data revealed extensive heterogeneity of miRNA deregulation with only several miRNAs consistently affected, and miR-9 being the most likely HPV related miRNA. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Development of combined therapies constitutes an effective strategy to inhibit cancer cells and prevent the emergence of drug resistance. For this purpose, we investigated the anti-tumoral effect of thirteen phenolic compounds, from the Tunisian quince Cydonia oblonga Miller, alone or combined to 5-FU, on the human 5-FU-resistant LS174-R colon cancer cells in comparison to parental cells. Our results showed that only Kaempferol was able to chemo-sensitize 5-FU-resistant LS174-R cells. This phenolic compound combined with 5-FU exerted synergistic inhibitory effect on cell viability. This combination enhanced the apoptosis and induced cell cycle arrest of both chemo-resistant and sensitive cells through impacting the expression levels of different cellular effectors. Kaempferol also blocked the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and modulated the expression of JAK/STAT3, MAPK, PI3K/AKT and NF-κB. In silico docking analysis suggested that the potent anti-tumoral effect of Kaempferol, compared to its two analogs (Kaempferol 3-O-glucoside and Kampferol 3-O-rutinoside), can be explained by the absence of glucosyl groups. Overall, our data propose Kaempferol as a potential chemotherapeutic agent to be used alone or in combination with 5-FU to overcome colon cancer drug resistance. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Considering the high prevalence and mortality rate of colorectal cancer, in this study we tried to design and validate a standard printed form and evaluate oncologists’ and nurses’ adherence to this form. This cross-sectional study was performed in Omid hospital, Mashhad, Iran from January 2015 to October 2015. A Chemotherapy form including various demographic and clinical parameters and approved chemotherapy regimens for colorectal cancer was designed by the clinical pharmacist and validated by clinical oncologists working in this center. All eligible patients admitted in this center during this period of time were included in the study. Adherence of the oncologists and nurses to this form and probable medication errors were identified by the pharmacy student. Sixty-seven patients with colorectal cancer and a total of 251 chemotherapy courses were evaluated. All patients received regimens compatible with developed form but in 206 courses (98.56%) of chemotherapy dosing error happened and in most of cases patients received lower than calculated dose (37.8%). Three errors occurred in administration step by nurses which they infused the medication in shorter than recommended duration. In general, oncologists’ adherence with developed form for chemotherapy of colorectal cancer was relatively high, except in dose calculation. Avoiding from rounding the calculated medications’ doses and precise calculation of patients’ body surface area can prevent most of medication errors and reduce risk of adverse drug reaction occurrence. © 2017, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

Nevertheless, the importance of transfusion timing is still unclear. The primary purpose of this study is to appraise whether the receipt of intraoperative blood transfusion (BT) differ from postoperative BT in regards to cancer outcomes in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients treated with nephrectomy. Data on 1168 patients with RCC, who underwent radical or partial nephrectomy as primary therapy between 1988–2013 were analyzed. PBT was defined as transfusion of allogeneic red blood cells (RBC) during surgery or the postsurgical period. Survival was analyzed and compared using the Kaplan–Meier method with the log-rank test. Of 1168 patients, 198 patients (16.9%) received a PBT. Including 117 intraoperative BT and 81 postoperative BT. Only 21 (10.6%) patients required both intraoperative and postoperative BT. On multivariate analyses, receipt of PBT was associated with significantly worse local disease recurrence (HR: 2.4; P = 0.017), metastatic progression (HR: 2.7; P = 0.005), cancer-specific mortality (HR: 3.5; P = 0.002) and all-cause mortality (HR: 2.1; P = 0.005). Nevertheless, postoperative BT was not independently associated with increased risk of local recurrence (p = 0.1), metastatic progression (P = 0.16) or kidney cancer death (P = 0.63), yet did significantly increase the risk of overall mortality (HR: 2.6; P = 0.004).

For this reason novel therapies accounting for PDAC peculiarities, such as the relevant stromal reaction, are urgently needed. Here adipose mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (AD-MSC) have been armed to constantly release a soluble trimeric and multimeric variant of the known anti-cancer TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (sTRAIL). This cancer gene therapy strategy was in vitro challenged demonstrating that sTRAIL was thermally stable and able to induce apoptosis in the PDAC lines BxPC-3, MIA PaCa-2 and against primary PDAC cells. sTRAIL released by AD-MSC relocated into the tumor stroma was able to significantly counteract tumor growth in vivo with a significant reduction in tumor size, in cytokeratin-7+ cells and by an anti-angiogenic effect. In parallel, histology on PDAC specimens form patients (n = 19) was performed to investigate the levels of TRAIL DR4, DR5 and OPG receptors generating promising insights on the possible clinical translation of our approach. These results indicate that adipose MSC can very efficiently vehicle a novel TRAIL variant opening unexplored opportunities for PDAC treatment. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Malignant melanoma is one of the untreatable cancers in which conventional therapeutic strategies, including chemotherapy, are hardly effective. Therefore, identification of novel therapeutic targets involved in melanoma progression is urgently needed for developing effective therapeutic methods. Overexpression of interleukin-13 receptor α2 (IL13Rα2) is observed in several cancer types including glioma and pancreatic cancer. Although IL13Rα2 is implicated in the progression of various types of cancer, its expression and roles in the malignant melanoma have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we showed that IL13Rα2 was expressed in approximately 7.5% melanoma patients. While IL13Rα2 expression in human melanoma cells decreased their proliferation in vitro, it promoted in vivo tumour growth and angiogenesis in melanoma xenograft mouse model. We also found that the expression of amphiregulin, a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, was correlated with IL13Rα2 expression in cultured melanoma cells, xenograft tumour tissues and melanoma clinical samples. Furthermore, expression of amphiregulin promoted tumour growth, implicating causal relationship between the expression of IL13Rα2 and amphiregulin. These results suggest that IL13Rα2 enhances tumorigenicity by inducing angiogenesis in malignant melanoma, and serves as a potential therapeutic target of malignant melanoma. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

However, its prognostic value and the underlying mechanism in lung cancer remains unclear. Herein we evaluated the expression of PKD2 in lung adenocarcinoma and investigated its relationship with EMT. GSEA, TCGA and K-M plotter database were applied and revealed that high PKD2 expression predicted poor outcome and related with lymph nodes metastasis in lung cancer. IHC and qRT-PCR were performed and found PKD2 was elevated in lung adenocarcinoma and negatively related with OS (p = 0.015), PFS (p = 0.006) and the level of E-cadherin (p = 0.021). Experiment in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines demonstrated up-regulation of PKD2 led to high expression of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vim, mmp9 et al.) and EMT transcription factors(zeb1, twist, snail), and the results were reversed when PKD2 was knocked down. Further investigation showed that abrogation of PKD2 inhibited A549 cell migration, invasion, proliferation and induced cell arrest in G2/M phase. We concluded that high expression of PKD2 was associated with poor prognosis and cancer progression in lung adenocarcinoma patients by promoting EMT. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

We showed for the first time that Raman imaging can be used to distinguish successfully between glycosylated and nonglycosylated proteins in normal and cancer tissue. Thousands of protein, lipid and glycan species exist in cells and tissues and their metabolism is monitored via numerous pathways, networks and methods. The metabolism can change in response to cellular environment alterations, such as development of a disease. Measuring such alterations and understanding the pathways involved are crucial to fully understand cellular metabolism in cancer development. In this paper Raman markers of glycogen, glycosaminoglycan, chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate proteoglycan were identified based on their vibrational signatures. High spatial resolution of Raman imaging combined with chemometrics allows separation of individual species from many chemical components present in each cell. We have found that metabolism of proteins, lipids and glycans is markedly deregulated in breast (adenocarcinoma) and brain (medulloblastoma) tumors. We have identified two glycoforms in the normal breast tissue and the malignant brain tissue in contrast to the breast cancer tissue where only one glycoform has been identified. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Very recently, we postulated that the incorporation of citral into nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC-Citral) improves solubility and delivery of the citral without toxic effects in vivo. Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate anti-cancer effects of NLC-Citral in MDA MB-231 cells in vitro through the Annexin V, cell cycle, JC-1 and fluorometric assays. Additionally, this study is aimed to effects of NLC-Citral in reducing the tumor weight and size in 4T1 induced murine breast cancer model. Results showed that NLC-Citral induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest in MDA MB-231 cells. Furthermore, a prominent anti-metastatic ability of NLC-Citral was demonstrated in vitro using scratch, migration and invasion assays. A significant reduction of migrated and invaded cells was observed in the NLC-Citral treated MDA MB-231 cells. To further evaluate the apoptotic and anti-metastatic mechanism of NLC-Citral at the molecular level, microarray-based gene expression and proteomic profiling were conducted. Based on the result obtained, NLC-Citral was found to regulate several important signaling pathways related to cancer development such as apoptosis, cell cycle, and metastasis signaling pathways. Additionally, gene expression analysis was validated through the targeted RNA sequencing and real-time polymerase chain reaction. In conclusion, the NLC-Citral inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells in vitro, majorly through the induction of apoptosis, anti-metastasis, anti-angiogenesis potentials, and reducing the tumor weight and size without altering the therapeutic effects of citral. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The incidence of developing cancer should increase with the body mass, yet is not the case, a conundrum referred to as Peto’s paradox. Elephants have a lower incidence of cancer suggesting that these animals have probably evolved different ways to protect themselves against the disease. The paradox is worth revisiting with the realization that most mammals encode an endogenous APOBEC3 cytidine deaminase capable of mutating single stranded DNA. Indeed, the mutagenic activity of some APOBEC3 enzymes has been shown to introduce somatic mutations into genomic DNA. These enzymes are now recognized as causal agent responsible for the accumulation of CG- > TA transitions and DNA breaks leading to chromosomal rearrangements in human cancer genomes. Here, we identified an elephant A3Z1 gene, related to human APOBEC3A and showed that it could efficiently deaminate cytidine, 5-methylcytidine and produce DNA breaks leading to massive apoptosis, similar to other mammalian APOBEC3A enzymes where body mass varies by up to four orders of magnitude. Consequently, it could be considered that eAZ1 might contribute to cancer in elephants in a manner similar to their proposed role in humans. If so, eAZ1 might be particularly well regulated to counter Peto’s paradox. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

The cells and mitochondria were isolated from cancerous and non-cancerous ovarian tissues and exposed to IC 50 concentration of F1 fraction for evaluation of mitochondrial and cellular parameters. Our results showed that F1 fraction of T. coronatus crude extract significantly induced toxic effects only in the cancerous ovarian mitochondria, including increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, mitochondrial swelling, and cytochrome c release.Flow-cytometry analysis demonstrated that F1 fraction of T. coronatus progressively induced apoptosis and necrosis only on EOC but not non-cancerous cells.

Biotin-PEG-PCL polymers have been used for targeted drug delivery to cancer, as well as to improve the pharmacokinetics of the drug and reduce its effects. In this study, biotin-conjugated copolymers were fabricated with polymerization of the ring opening method and the properties of copolymer and nanoparticles were investigated using various techniques. The toxicity of artemisinin and its nanoparticles have been investigated on MCF-7 and normal HFF2 cells. The results showed that the encapsulation efficacy of artemisinin in nanoparticles was 45.5 ± 0.41%. The release profile of the drug indicates that the release is slow and controlled and is approximately pH dependent. The results of artemisinin cell culture on human breast cancer cells showed that biotin-PEG-PCL nanoparticles had an inhibitory effect on MCF-7 cells and had no toxic effects on HFF2 cells. Anticancer activity in vivo in the 4T1 breast cancer model showed that tumour volumes were decreased up 40 mm3 by ART-loaded micelles and 76 mm3 by free ART, compared to the control group (2150 mm). In vivo results showed that this formulation significantly increases the accumulation of substances in the tumours. Therefore, the molecular formulation of ART-based copolymers can be a desirable process for cancer treatment purposes. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group." ;

Previous reports have shown the effectiveness of BP in treating cancer diseases. However, BP has no targeting capacity towards specific cancer cells. To improve treatment efficiency and reduce the dose of BP used in cancer treatment, targeting-based approaches should be developed. In the present study, we used riboflavin-5′-phosphate (RFMP) immobilized iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4 MNPs) as carriers for BP to treat cancer cell lines derived from liver, prostate and breast. These model cancer cells overexpress riboflavin receptors on their cell membrane and are also sensitive to BP treatment. Thus, BP-binding free RFMP on MNPs can be used as probes to target these model cells, whereas BP can be readily released on target cancer cells. Cell viability was twofold lower by using Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs immobilized with BP than that achieved by using free-form BP at a similar amount. Moreover, BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs have no apparent harmful effects on non-target cells. In addition, we evaluated the level of cysteine-aspartic acid protease 3 (caspase 3) in the resultant cell lysate obtained after treatment by BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs to demonstrate that apoptosis is mainly involved in the growth inhibition of target cells. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Patients with laryngeal cancer (ICD-10: C32) between 2009 and 2010 were retrospectively identified and tracked until 2015 using the Korean Health Insurance claims database. During the seven-year follow-up period, 5,322 subjects were newly diagnosed with larynx cancer. The mean age of people with laryngeal cancer was much higher than those without (63.29 vs. 47.7 years, p < 0.0001), and the incidence of larynx cancer in men was much higher than that in women (93.16% vs. 6.84%, p < 0.0001). Age, gender, smoking status, alcohol intake, and exercise-adjusted hazard ratios indicated that participants with MetS had a 1.13-fold higher hazard of having larynx cancer than those without MetS. The number of MetS components was a strong risk factor for laryngeal cancer with a higher risk estimate of this cancer in both ex- and current smokers as well as people who have never smoked. MetS was found to be an independent risk factor for the incidence of laryngeal cancer.

        fabio:abstract    "Chromosome changes are one of the hallmarks of human malignancies. Chromosomal rearrangement is frequent in human cancers. One of the consequences of chromosomal rearrangement is gene fusions in the cancer genome. We have previously identified a panel of fusion genes in aggressive prostate cancers. In this study, we showed that 6 of these fusion genes are present in 7 different types of human malignancies with variable frequencies. Among them, the CCNH-C5orf30 and TRMT11-GRIK2 gene fusions were found in breast cancer, colon cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, ovarian cancer and liver cancer, with frequencies ranging from 12.9% to 85%. In contrast, four other gene fusions (mTOR-TP53BP1, TMEM135-CCDC67, KDM4-AC011523.2 and LRRC59-FLJ60017) are less frequent. Both TRMT11-GRIK2 and CCNH-C5orf30 are also frequently present in lymph node metastatic cancer samples from the breast, colon and ovary. Thus, detecting these fusion transcripts may have significant biological and clinical implications in cancer patient management. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Quantifying the genetic correlation between cancers can provide important insights into the mechanisms driving cancer etiology. Using genome-wide association study summary statistics across six cancer types based on a total of 296,215 cases and 301,319 controls of European ancestry, here we estimate the pair-wise genetic correlations between breast, colorectal, head/neck, lung, ovary and prostate cancer, and between cancers and 38 other diseases. We observed statistically significant genetic correlations between lung and head/neck cancer (r g = 0.57, p = 4.6 × 10 −8 ), breast and ovarian cancer (r g = 0.24, p = 7 × 10 −5 ), breast and lung cancer (r g = 0.18, p =1.5 × 10 −6 ) and breast and colorectal cancer (r g = 0.15, p = 1.1 × 10 −4 ). We also found that multiple cancers are genetically correlated with non-cancer traits including smoking, psychiatric diseases and metabolic characteristics.

        fabio:abstract    "Purpose: Several previous studies have shown that oral bisphosphonates (BPs) are associated with the incidence of 13 specific cancers, including lung cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the findings are heterogeneous. Methods and results: Relevant studies published in databases such as PubMed, Embase database, and Cochrane library were systematically retrieved from inception to August 25th, 2018, regardless of language, by two investigators independently. Afterwards, the maximum adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted from the retrieved studies. Finally, 13 cohort studies involving 1,510,763 participants were enrolled into this meta-analysis. No significant relationship was found between oral BPs and the risk of all-cause cancer in osteoporosis (OP) patients among the entire population (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80–1.18; I 2 92.5%). Besides, oral BPs could remarkably reduce the incidence of breast cancer (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68–0.92; I 2 54%) and endometrial cancer (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64–0.96; I 2 0%) in postmenopausal OP females. In addition, oral BPs were also found to evidently reduce the incidence of upper gastrointestinal cancer in OP patients among the entire population (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54–0.98; I 2 36.1%). However, oral BPs may lead to increased risk of liver cancer in mixed genders (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.03–2.77; I 2 30.7%). Conclusions: Taken together, oral BPs do not increase the risk of incidence of all-cause cancer; instead, they can reduce the incidence of breast, endometrial, and upper gastrointestinal cancers among the postmenopausal OP females. Our analysis stratified by gender suggests that oral BPs may increase the incidence of liver cancer in mixed genders, while no significant association was observed in females. Careful analysis of post-marketing data should be conducted to address the clinical relevance of our results on the putative association of oral BP use and liver cancer suggested by our meta-analysis. © 2018, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation." ;

However, it remains unclear how cancer cells migrate in the three-dimensional (3D) matrix of cancer tissues and how CAFs support the cancer invasion. Here we propose a novel mechanism of fibroblast-dependent cancer cell invasion in the 3D collagen matrix. Human cancer cell lines from the pancreas (Panc-1), lung (A549) and some other organs actively adhered to normal fibroblasts and primary lung CAFs in cultures. To show its significance in tumor invasion, we designed a new invasion assay in which homogeneous microspheroids consisting of cancer cells and fibroblasts were embedded into collagen gel. Time-lapse experiments showed that cancer cells adhered to and quickly migrated on the long protrusions of fibroblasts in the 3D collagen matrix. Fibroblast-free cancer cells poorly invaded the matrix. Experiments with function-blocking antibodies, siRNAs, and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that cancer cells adhered to fibroblasts through integrin α5β1-mediated binding to fibronectin on the surface of fibroblasts. Immunochemical analyses of the co-cultures and lung cancers suggested that cancer cells could acquire the migratory force by the fibronectin/integrin signaling. Our results also revealed that the fibroblast-bound fibronectin was a preferential substrate for cancer cells to migrate in the collagen matrix. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

However, very few studies investigated the role of integrin α3 (ITGα3) in malignant cancers. Here, we determined the functional role of ITGα3 in pancreatic cancer. Analysis of public microarray databases and Western blot analysis indicated a unique expression of ITGα3 in human pancreatic cancer. Silencing ITGα3 expression significantly inhibited the viability and migration of human pancreatic cancer cells. Notably, ablation of ITGα3 expression resulted in a significant decrease of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression compared with transfection of control-siRNA through an increased number of leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domain protein 1 (LRIG1) expression. In addition, ablating ITGα3 inhibited tumour growth via blockade of EGFR signalling in vivo. Furthermore, the highly expressed ITGα3 led to a poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. Our results provide novel insights into ITGα3-induced aggressive pancreatic cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Since epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in promoting metastasis of cancer, many mechanisms regarding EMT have been studied. We previously showed that Ribonucleic acid export 1 (RAE1) is dysregulated in breast cancer and its overexpression leads to aggressive breast cancer phenotypes by inducing EMT. Here, we evaluated the functional capacity of RAE1 in breast cancer metastasis by using a three-dimensional (3D) culture system and xenograft models. Furthermore, to investigate the mechanisms of RAE1-driven EMT, in vitro studies were carried out. The induction of EMT with RAE1-overexpression was confirmed under the 3D culture system and in vivo system. Importantly, RAE1 mediates upregulation of an EMT marker ZEB1, by binding to the promoter region of ZEB1. Knockdown of ZEB1 in RAE1-overexpressing cells suppressed invasive and migratory behaviors, accompanied by an increase in epithelial and a decrease in mesenchymal markers. Taken together, these data demonstrate that RAE1 contributes to breast cancer metastasis by regulating a key EMT-inducing factor ZEB1 expression, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Obesity is a risk factor for many cancers including breast, esophageal, colon, and thyroid cancer. We aimed to evaluate the association of thyroid cancer with body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and weight change. This nationwide population-based cohort study included 11,323,006 adults who joined the national health screening program. Weight change was defined as the difference between the weight of the subjects measured during the study period and the weight at the time of four years ago. For evaluating the association between the weight change and the risk of thyroid cancer, subjects without weight change for four years were defined as the reference group. Mean age was 50.1 ± 13.7 years and 44% were female. In total, 50,464 subjects (0.4%) had newly-diagnosed thyroid cancer. After multivariable analyses, the incidence of thyroid cancer increased significantly in subjects with larger WC as well as higher BMI (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). In subjects who were lean and became obese, the incidence of thyroid cancers increased significantly (hazard ratio [HR] 1.15 [1.11–1.19]). In subjects who were obese and became lean, the incidence of thyroid cancers decreased significantly (HR 0.89 [0.86–0.93]). These results demonstrated that higher BMI and larger WC were significantly associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer. Weight gain in lean subjects was associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer, and weight reduction in subjects with obesity was associated with a decreased risk of thyroid cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

In order to understand this increase, country specific dietary exposures have been investigated. The aim of this study was to quantify the association between consumption of brown cheese, a common bread topping in Norway, and colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer in the prospective Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) Study. Data on brown cheese consumption and adjustment factors was available for 82 527 women. During a mean of 14.6 years of follow-up (1.2 million person-years), there were 1360 cases of colorectal cancer (907 colon; 453 rectal). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer sites. We modelled restricted cubic splines with 4 knots, to assess a possible non-linear relationship between brown cheese intake and the investigated cancer sites. In the age-adjusted model, consumption of more than 2 slices (>16 grams) of brown cheese per day was associated with 13% reduced risk of colon cancer (95% CI 4%-21%) compared to women who did not consume brown cheese. The multivariable-adjusted model, however, showed no association between brown cheese consumption and the risk of colorectal, colon, or rectal cancer (colorectal: HR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.76–1.13, p-trend 0.37; colon: HR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.65–1.06; p-trend = 0.10; rectal: HR = 1.16, 95% CI 0.84–1.1.61, p-trend = 0.41). In this large, prospective cohort study of women, consumption of brown cheese was suggestively protective against colon cancer. However, adjustment attenuated the inverse risk association. Brown cheese consumption was not associated with rectal cancer, or colorectal cancer overall. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Current cancer diagnosis utilizes histopathology, which requires tissue acquisition, extensive processing and, in most cases, relies on the qualitative morphological analysis of tissues and cells. Molecular biomarkers are only available for a few specific tumor subtypes. We discovered that the fluorescence polarization (Fpol) of Methylene Blue (MB) is significantly higher in cancer than in normal human breast tissues and cells. We confirmed that fluorescence polarization imaging did not affect the viability of the cells and yielded highly significant differences between cancer and normal cells using MB concentrations as low as 0.05 and 0.01 mg/ml. To explain this phenomenon we examined intracellular localization of MB and its fluorescence lifetime. We determined that higher fluorescence polarization of MB occurs due to its increased accumulation in mitochondria of cancer cells, as well as shorter fluorescence lifetime in cancer relative to normal cells. As quantitative MB Fpol imaging can be performed in vivo and in real time, it holds the potential to provide an accurate quantitative marker of cancer at the cellular level. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

The anticancer polymers are designed to target anionic lipids exposed on the cancer cell surfaces and act by disrupting the cancer cell membranes. Because the polymer mechanism is not dependent on cell proliferation, we hypothesized that the polymers were active against dormant cancer cells. The polymers exhibited cytotoxicity to proliferating prostate cancer. Importantly, the polymer killed dormant prostate cancer cells that were resistant to docetaxel. This study demonstrates a new approach to discover novel anticancer therapeutics. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

We developed a novel computational platform applying a multi-modal approach to filter out passengers and more robustly identify putative driver genes. The primary filter identifies enrichment of cancer mutations in CATH functional families (CATH-FunFams) – structurally and functionally coherent sets of evolutionary related domains. Using structural representatives from CATH-FunFams, we subsequently seek enrichment of mutations in 3D and show that these mutation clusters have a very significant tendency to lie close to known functional sites or conserved sites predicted using CATH-FunFams. Our third filter identifies enrichment of putative driver genes in functionally coherent protein network modules confirmed by literature analysis to be cancer associated. Our approach is complementary to other domain enrichment approaches exploiting Pfam families, but benefits from more functionally coherent groupings of domains. Using a set of mutations from 22 cancers we detect 151 putative cancer drivers, of which 79 are not listed in cancer resources and include recently validated cancer associated genes EPHA7, DCC netrin-1 receptor and zinc-finger protein ZNF479. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Cox proportional hazards models were used. Males and females classified as obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg /m −2 ) have a 33% and 22% increased risk of all-cancer, respectively, than their normal weight counterparts. Similar all-cancer risk increases are observed for those above sex-specific WC guidelines.

Collectively, 86.3% (63/73) of HAMPs have recurrent alterations in at least 1 cancer type and 16 HAMPs, including 9 understudied HAMPs, are identified as putative therapeutic targets across multiple cancer types. For example, the recurrent focal amplification of BRD9 is observed in 9 cancer types and genetic depletion of BRD9 inhibits tumor growth.

        fabio:abstract    "The current system for evaluating prostate cancer architecture is the Gleason grading system which divides the morphology of cancer into five distinct architectural patterns, labeled 1 to 5 in increasing levels of cancer aggressiveness, and generates a score by summing the labels of the two most dominant patterns. The Gleason score is currently the most powerful prognostic predictor of patient outcomes; however, it suffers from problems in reproducibility and consistency due to the high intra-observer and inter-observer variability amongst pathologists. In addition, the Gleason system lacks the granularity to address potentially prognostic architectural features beyond Gleason patterns. We evaluate prostate cancer for architectural subtypes using techniques from topological data analysis applied to prostate cancer glandular architecture. In this work we demonstrate the use of persistent homology to capture architectural features independently of Gleason patterns. Specifically, using persistent homology, we compute topological representations of purely graded prostate cancer histopathology images of Gleason patterns 3,4 and 5, and show that persistent homology is capable of clustering prostate cancer histology into architectural groups through a ranked persistence vector. Our results indicate the ability of persistent homology to cluster prostate cancer histopathology images into unique groups with dominant architectural patterns consistent with the continuum of Gleason patterns. In addition, of particular interest, is the sensitivity of persistent homology to identify specific sub-architectural groups within single Gleason patterns, suggesting that persistent homology could represent a robust quantification method for prostate cancer architecture with higher granularity than the existing semi-quantitative measures. The capability of these topological representations to segregate prostate cancer by architecture makes them an ideal candidate for use as inputs to future machine learning approaches with the intent of augmenting traditional approaches with topological features for improved diagnosis and prognosis. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Accumulative studies demonstrate that UHRF1 is broadly overexpressed in cancers, which contributes to cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Interestingly, a proteasome-dependent downregulation of UHRF1 has been observed in pluripotent ground state mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) cultured in the presence of two kinase (MEK1/MEK2 and GSK3β) inhibitors (termed 2i), raising the question whether UHRF1 is similarly regulated in cancer cells. Here we present evidence that while addition of 2i broadly downregulates UHRF1 and DNMT1 in various cancer cells, distinct underlying mechanisms are involved. In contrast to mESCs, 2i-induced downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in cancer cells cannot be rescued by proteasome inhibitor and occurs primarily at the level of transcription. Furthermore, downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 by 2i is due to inhibition of MEK1/MEK2, but not GSK3β activity. Data mining reveals a marked co-expression of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in normal tissues as well as cancers. We provide evidence that multiple transcription factors including E2F1 and SP1 mediate the transcriptional activation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 by the activated MEK/ERK pathway. Together our study reveals distinct regulation of UHRF1/DNMT1 in mESCs and cancer cells and identifies activated MEK/ERK pathway as a driving force for coordinated and aberrant over-expression of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in cancers. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

When it is applied to cancer cells, solid stress hinders their proliferation rate and promotes cancer cell invasion and metastatic potential.

Here, we used two pancreatic cancer cell lines and an established in vitro system to study the effect of solid stress-induced signal transduction on pancreatic cancer cell migration as well as the mechanism involved. Our results show that the migratory ability of cells increases as a direct response to solid stress. We also found that Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) expression and secretion is strongly upregulated in pancreatic cancer cells in response to mechanical compression. Performing a phosphoprotein screening, we identified that solid stress activates the Akt/CREB1 pathway to transcriptionally regulate GDF15 expression, which eventually promotes pancreatic cancer cell migration. Our results suggest a novel solid stress signal transduction mechanism bringing GDF15 to the centre of pancreatic tumor biology and rendering it a potential target for future anti-metastatic therapeutic innovations. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a cancer treatment that make use of the cancer-specific accumulation of porphyrins. We have reported that mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mitROS) upregulate uptake transporter of porphyrins, heme carrier protein-1 (HCP-1). The accumulation of cancer-specific porphyrins was increased by mitROS production, thereby the cancer-specific PDT cytotoxicity was enhanced. Thus we investigated whether mitROS production by hyperthermia can enhanced the cytotoxicity of PDT or not. In this study, 1 h of hyperthermia at 42 °C increased the mitROS production, and both the accumulation of cancer-specific porphyrins and the PDT cytotoxicity increased. Moreover, the authors treated cells with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) to examine the effect of mitROS. NAC inhibited the increasing ROS production after hyperthermia to restrain the post-treatment increase of cancer-specific porphyrins accumulation. Moreover, the increase of ROS production in cancer cells after hyperthermia upregulated HCP-1 expression and downregulated ABCG2 expression. These regulation were inhibited by NAC. These results suggest that hyperthermia treatment increased mitROS production, which involved HpD accumulation and enhanced PDT effects in cancer cells. The mechanism of this phenomenon was most likely to be due to both the upregulation of HCP-1 and the downregulation of ABCG2 by mitROS. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Recent studies showed that changes to the gut microbiome alters the microbiome-derived metabolome, potentially promoting carcinogenesis in organs that are distal to the gut. In this study, we assessed the relationship between breast cancer and cadaverine biosynthesis. Cadaverine treatment of Balb/c female mice (500 nmol/kg p.o. q.d.) grafted with 4T1 breast cancer cells ameliorated the disease (lower mass and infiltration of the primary tumor, fewer metastases, and lower grade tumors). Cadaverine treatment of breast cancer cell lines corresponding to its serum reference range (100–800 nM) reverted endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, inhibited cellular movement and invasion, moreover, rendered cells less stem cell-like through reducing mitochondrial oxidation. Trace amino acid receptors (TAARs), namely, TAAR1, TAAR8 and TAAR9 were instrumental in provoking the cadaverine-evoked effects. Early stage breast cancer patients, versus control women, had reduced abundance of the CadA and LdcC genes in fecal DNA, both responsible for bacterial cadaverine production. Moreover, we found low protein expression of E. coli LdcC in the feces of stage 1 breast cancer patients. In addition, higher expression of lysine decarboxylase resulted in a prolonged survival among early-stage breast cancer patients. Taken together, cadaverine production seems to be a regulator of early breast cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

The specific function of CBX6 in breast cancer is currently undefined. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset led to the identification of CBX6 as a consistently downregulated gene in breast cancer. We provided evidence showing enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) negatively regulated CBX6 expression in a Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)-dependent manner. Exogenous overexpression of CBX6 inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation, and induced cell cycle arrest along with suppression of migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro. Microarray analyses revealed that CBX6 governs a complex gene expression program. Moreover, CBX6 induced significant downregulation of bone marrow stromal cell antigen-2 (BST2), a potential therapeutic target, via interactions with its promoter region. Our collective findings support a tumor suppressor role of CBX6 in breast cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "MRI plays important roles in endometrial and cervical cancer assessment, from detection to recurrent disease evaluation. Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common malignant tumor of the female genital tract in Western countries. EC patients are divided into risk categories based on histopathological tumor type, grade, and myometrial invasion depth. EC is surgically staged using the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) system. Since FIGO (2009) stage correlates with prognosis, preoperative staging is essential for tailored treatment. MRI reveals myometrial invasion depth, which correlates with tumor grade and lymph node metastases, and thus correlates with prognosis. Cervical cancer (CC) is the second most common cancer, and the third leading cause of cancer-related death among females in developing countries. The FIGO Gynecologic Oncology Committee recently revised its CC staging guidelines, allowing staging based on imaging and pathological findings when available. The revised FIGO (2018) staging includes node involvement and thus enables both therapy selection and evaluation, prognosis estimation, and calculation of end results. MRI can accurately assess prognostic indicators, e.g., tumor size, parametrial invasion, pelvic sidewall, and lymph node invasion. Despite these important roles of MRI, radiologists still face challenges due to the technical and interpretation pitfalls of MRI during all phases of endometrial and cervical cancer evaluation. Awareness of mimics that can simulate both cancers is critical. With careful application, functional MRI with DWI and DCE sequences can help establish a correct diagnosis, although it is sometimes necessary to perform biopsy and histopathological analysis. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

This led to the first biological based liquid biopsy test, which we called MATER-D platform. In the present study, we showed for the first time that a different type of OMCs (PTEN-deficient human epithelial MCF10A cells) turn malignant when exposed to cancer patient’s sera, confirming the concept that different cells with diverse oncosuppressor mutations can uptake cancer factors and be used in biological based liquid biopsy tests. Our observations were confirmed in a large variety of solid and haematological malignancies. This test was able to detect dysplasia and carcinomas in situ lesions in different organs and circulating factors in cancer patients years after the removal of their lesions. To our knowledge, this ability is unique and not shared by other liquid biopsy platforms. Immunohistochemistry analysis of the xenotransplants revealed identical patterns of differentiation regardless of the cancer type, showing that differentiation through horizontal transfer might be dependent on the nature of the target cells rather than the type of cancer factors. These data strengthen the notion that OMC-based liquid biopsy tests might be promising platforms for cancer screening. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Various studies have shown the significance of identifying drug targets for cancer, although this process continues challenging in the field of anti-cancer drug designing. The primary purpose of this study is to design a novel approach to identify target genes for cancer. The sub-network of colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancers were constructed from human protein–protein interaction network. The potential genes were analyzed using hubs and centrality measures. For the identification of target genes, we retrieve those genes that had the highest score in both mutation rates and graph centrality. Moreover, gene deletion analysis revealed that MYC, TP53, and EGFR genes remained potential targets in colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancer respectively. Results suggest that combining network measures with mutation frequencies in cancer genes might assist in recognizing several potential drug targets. Future enhancement of this current approach is to combine these network properties with the biological insights from gene expression data, and their functions will provide a reliable method for rational drug designing. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature." ;

Owing to enhanced permeability and retention in solid tumor tissue, nanoparticle (NP) delivery systems have been emerged as novel strategy in cancer chemotherapy. As extracellular matrix, glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) could bind its surface receptor adhesion molecule CD44 which is strongly expressed on breast cancer. We have previously reported a doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded HA-Lys-LA X-NPs (X-NP-DOX) NP delivery system for breast cancer treatment. In this study, we further investigated the antitumor effect of X-NP-DOX NP delivery system using low-dose DOX in both in vitro and in vivo systems. We demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX possessed the ability for inhibiting MCF-7 breast cancer cell growth, invasion, and migration, and inducing apoptosis in vitro. In in vivo experiments, injection of low-dose X-NP-DOX into tumor-bearing mouse resulted in significant reduction of tumor size. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining further revealed that low-dose X-NP-DOX induced higher percentage of apoptotic cells compared with free DOX or saline. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX inhibited Notch1 and Ras/MAPK pathways, decreased cancer stem cell population, and reduced tumorigenesis compared to free DOX in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Owing to its enhanced efficacy and higher targetability compared to free DOX, low-dose DOX delivered by NP system may be a promising novel strategy for breast cancer treatment." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Breast cancer survivors display altered inflammatory responses to immune challenges relative to cancer-naive controls likely due to previous cancer treatments, stress associated with cancer, and/or tumor physiology. Proper inflammatory responses are necessary for adaptive sickness behaviors (e.g., fatigue, anorexia, and fever) and neuroinflammatory pathways are also implicated in mental health disturbances (e.g., cognitive impairment, depression) suffered by cancer patients and survivors. Rodent cancer models indicate that tumors are sufficient to exacerbate neuroinflammatory responses after an immune challenge, however primary tumors are not usually present in cancer survivors, and the behavioral consequences of these brain changes remain understudied. Therefore, we tested the extent to which mammary tumor resection attenuates tumor-induced neuroinflammation and sickness behavior following an immune challenge (i.p. lipopolysaccharide [LPS] injection) in mice. Tnf-α, Il-1β, and Il-6 mRNA decreased in multiple brain regions of LPS-treated tumor-bearing mice relative to LPS-treated controls; tumor resection attenuated these effects in some cases (but not Tnf-α). Tumors also attenuated sickness behaviors (hypothermia and lethargy) compared to LPS-treated controls. Tumor resection reversed these behavioral consequences, although basal body temperature remained elevated, comparable to tumor-bearing mice. Thus, tumors significantly modulate neuroinflammatory pathways with functional consequences and tumor resection mitigates most, but not all, of these changes. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Natural compounds are a realistic source of new bioactive compounds with anticancer activity. Among them, rosemary polyphenols have shown a vast antiproliferative capacity against colon cancer cells in vitro and in animal models. We have investigated the antitumor activity of a rosemary extract (RE) obtained by using supercritical fluid extraction through its capacity to inhibit various signatures of cancer progression and metastasis such as proliferation, migration, invasion and clonogenic survival. RE strongly inhibited proliferation, migration and colony formation of colon cancer cells regardless their phenotype. Treatment with RE led to a sharp increase of intracellular ROS that resulted in necrosis cell death. Nrf2 gene silencing increased RE cytotoxic effects, thus suggesting that this pathway was involved in cell survival. These in vitro results were in line with a reduction of tumor growth by oral administration of RE in a xenograft model of colon cancer cells using athymic nude mice. These findings indicate that targeting colon cancer cells by increasing intracellular ROS and decreasing cell survival mechanisms may suppose a therapeutic option in colon cancer through the combination of rosemary compounds and chemotherapeutic drugs. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Although cure rates are high for early stage disease, clinical outcomes for advanced, metastatic, or recurrent disease remain poor. To change this panorama, a deeper understanding of cervical cancer biology and novel study models are needed. Immortalized human cancer cell lines such as HeLa constitute crucial scientific tools, but there are few other cervical cancer cell lines available, limiting our understanding of a disease known for its molecular heterogeneity. This study aimed to establish novel cervical cancer cell lines derived from Brazilian patients. We successfully established one (HCB-514) out of 35 cervical tumors biopsied. We confirmed the phenotype of HCB-514 by verifying its’ epithelial and tumor origin through cytokeratins, EpCAM and p16 staining. It was also HPV-16 positive. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) showed relevant somatic mutations in several genes including BRCA2, TGFBR1 and IRX2. A copy number variation (CNV) analysis by nanostring and WES revealed amplification of genes mainly related to kinases proteins involved in proliferation, migration and cell differentiation, such as EGFR, PIK3CA, and MAPK7. Overexpression of EGFR was confirmed by phospho RTK-array and validated by western blot analysis. Furthermore, the HCB-514 cell line was sensitive to cisplatin. In summary, this novel Brazilian cervical cancer cell line exhibits relevant key molecular features and constitutes a new biological model for pre-clinical studies. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Oncogene-induced replication stress (RS) promotes cancer development but also impedes tumor growth by activating anti-cancer barriers. To determine how cancer cells adapt to RS, we have monitored the expression of different components of the ATR-CHK1 pathway in primary tumor samples. We show that unlike upstream components of the pathway, the checkpoint mediators Claspin and Timeless are overexpressed in a coordinated manner. Remarkably, reducing the levels of Claspin and Timeless in HCT116 cells to pretumoral levels impeded fork progression without affecting checkpoint signaling. These data indicate that high level of Claspin and Timeless increase RS tolerance by protecting replication forks in cancer cells. Moreover, we report that primary fibroblasts adapt to oncogene-induced RS by spontaneously overexpressing Claspin and Timeless, independently of ATR signaling. Altogether, these data indicate that enhanced levels of Claspin and Timeless represent a gain of function that protects cancer cells from of oncogene-induced RS in a checkpoint-independent manner. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Turmeric, since in ancient Indian traditional medicinal system, has been implicated for its therapeutic and chemopreventive properties against a broad spectrum of diseases. Curcumin, the active polyphenol from turmeric, helps to obstruct the growth of many types of cancers at various stages which include prostrate, melanoma, breast, brain tumor, pancreatic, leukemia, etc. The initiation and recurrence of cancer have been attributed to few mutated cells in bulk of tumor called as cancer stem cells which have the capacity of self-renewal and differentiation. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3B) is a multifunctional serine/threonine protein kinase, originally found in mammals, an important component of diverse signaling pathways, dysregulation of which leads to affect the cancer stem cell properties. The nutritional- and phytochemical-based dietary interventions may complement current chemotherapy to prevent recurrence and relapse of cancer. The objective of present study is to investigate the effect of retinoic acid and curcumin–retinoic acid conjugates against GSK-3B protein. The in silico results indicate that molecule 3 (curcumin–retinoic acid conjugates) might be a potent inhibitor of GSK-3B and a novel future drug candidate for the treatment of cancer. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature." ;

        fabio:abstract    "In this study, we aimed to identify mutations of key genes associated with docetaxel resistance in nine endometrial cancer cell lines. Endometrial cancers are associated with several critical gene mutations, including PIK3A, PTEN, and KRAS. Different gene mutations in endometrial cancer cells have varied responses to anticancer drugs and cancer therapies. The most frequently altered gene in endometrioid endometrial carcinoma tumors is PTEN. PTEN protein has lipid phosphatase and protein phosphatase activity, as well as other functions in the nucleus. Although the tumor-suppressive function of PTEN has mainly been attributed to its lipid phosphatase activity, a role for PTEN protein phosphatase activity in cell cycle regulation has also been suggested. Various tumor type-specific PTEN mutations are well documented. Here, nine endometrioid endometrial cancer cell lines with PIK3A, PTEN, and KRAS gene mutations were treated with docetaxel and radiation. One mutation with a docetaxel drug-resistant effect was a truncated form of PTEN. Among PTEN mutations in endometrial cancer cells, the Y68 frame shift mutation of PTEN constitutes a major mechanism of resistance to docetaxel treatment. The molecular mechanism involves truncation of the 403 amino acid PTEN protein at amino acid 68 by the Y68 frame shift, leading to the loss of PTEN protein phosphatase and lipid phosphatase activities. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Hence to mimic such complex biological processes, an understanding of stimuli responsiveness is needed to sense specific changes and respond in a predictable manner. Such responses due to polymers may take place either simultaneously at the site or in a sequential manner from preparation to transporting pathways to cellular compartments. The present review comprehends the stimuli-responsive polymers and multi-responsiveness with respect to cancer therapy. It focuses on the exploitation of different stimuli like temperature, pH and enzymes responsiveness in a multi-stimuli setting. Nanogels and micelles being two of the most commonly used responsive polymeric carriers have also been discussed. The role of multiple stimuli delivery system is significant due to multiple changes happening in the near surroundings of cancer cells. These responsive materials are able to mimic some biological processes and recognize at the molecular level itself to manipulate development of custom-designed molecules for targeting cancer cells." ;

In contrast, antibodies to BLV were found in a very small percentage of healthy blood donors. There was no association between BLV DNA and other tumor prognostic biological markers such as hormonal receptors, HER2 oncoprotein, proliferation index, metastasis in sentinels lymph nodes, and tumor grade and size.

Here we report that ovarian cancer cells manifest a spectrum of tumorigenic phenotypes upon knockdown of PIK3R1. PIK3R1 loss activates AKT and p110-independent JAK2/STAT3 signaling through inducing changes in the phosphorylation of the docking protein Gab2, thereby relieving the negative inhibition on AKT and promoting the assembly of JAK2/STAT3 signalosome, respectively. Additional mechanisms leading to AKT activation include enhanced p110α kinase activity and a decrease in PTEN level. PIK3R1 loss renders ovarian cancer cells vulnerable to inhibition of AKT or JAK2/STAT3. The combination of AKT and STAT3 inhibitors significantly increases the anti-tumor effect compared to single-agent treatments.

Finally, analysis of 214 prostate and 35 breast cancer genomes reveal that late-replicating regions are prone to cis and early-replication to trans chromosomal rearrangements.

        fabio:abstract    "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are promising therapies for haematological cancers. Historically, their therapeutic benefit is due to ADC targeting of lineage-restricted antigens. The C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is attractive for targeted therapy of haematological cancers, given its expression in multiple tumour types and role in cancer “homing” to bone marrow. However, CXCR4 is also expressed in haematopoietic cells and other normal tissues, raising safety challenges to the development of anti-CXCR4 ADCs for cancer treatment. Here, we designed the first anti-CXCR4 ADC with favourable therapeutic index, effective in xenografts of haematopoietic cancers resistant to standard of care and anti-CXCR4 antibodies. We screened multiple ADC configurations, by varying type of linker-payload, drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR), affinity and Fc format. The optimal ADC bears a non-cleavable linker, auristatin as payload at DAR = 4 and a low affinity antibody with effector–reduced Fc. Contrary to other drugs targeting CXCR4, anti-CXCR4 ADCs effectively eliminated cancer cells as monotherapy, while minimizing leucocytosis. The optimal ADC selectively eliminated CXCR4 + cancer cells in solid tumours, but showed limited toxicity to normal CXCR4 + tissues, sparing haematopoietic stem cells and progenitors. Our work provides proof-of-concept that through empirical ADC design, it is possible to target proteins with broad normal tissue expression. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Cancers in the bone produce a number of severe symptoms including pain that compromises patient functional status, quality of life, and survival. The source of this pain is multifaceted and includes factors secreted from tumor cells. Malignant cells release the neurotransmitter and cell-signaling molecule glutamate via the oxidative stress-related cystine/glutamate antiporter, system x C − , which reciprocally imports cystine for synthesis of glutathione and the cystine/cysteine redox cycle. Pharmacological inhibition of system x C − has shown success in reducing and delaying the onset of cancer pain-related behavior in mouse models. This investigation describes the development of a stable siRNA-induced knockdown of the functional trans-membrane system x C − subunit xCT (SLC7A11) in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Clones were verified for xCT knockdown at the transcript, protein, and functional levels. RNAseq was performed on a representative clone to comprehensively examine the transcriptional cellular signature in response to xCT knockdown, identifying multiple differentially regulated factors relevant to cancer pain including nerve growth factor, interleukin-1, and colony-stimulating factor-1. Mice were inoculated intrafemorally and recordings of pain-related behaviors including weight bearing, mechanical withdrawal, and limb use were performed. Animals implanted with xCT knockdown cancer cells displayed a delay until the onset of nociceptive behaviors relative to control cells. These results add to the body of evidence suggesting that a reduction in glutamate release from cancers in bone by inhibition of the system x C − transporter may decrease the severe and intractable pain associated with bone metastases. © The Author(s) 2019." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Background: The global cancer incidence and the number of survivors are increasing. Therefore, it is necessary to pay more attention to the side effects of treatment. Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of reflexology on the side effects of chemotherapy in cancer patients. Method: For finding the related articles, the researchers searched several databases including PubMed &ProQuest and valid websites including ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Scientific Information Database, and Magiran. The key terms of \"reflexology, cancer, and chemotherapy\" individually and combined together were searched in Parisian and English, and the studies performed from 2009 to 2018 were extracted. Due to the lack of sufficient studies carried out into the outcome of reflexology on chemotherapy, both Persian and English articles were used. Results: A total of 57 studies were extracted from the databases and valid websites; five of which met the inclusion criteria. All selected studies were clinical trials. Implications for Practice: Reflexology can be used as a non-pharmacologic nursing intervention to alleviate the side effects of chemotherapy and improve the quality of life of cancer patients. © 2019 Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

        fabio:abstract    "CD47 is a prominent new target in cancer immunotherapy, with antagonistic antibodies currently being evaluated in clinical trials. For effective evaluation of this strategy it is crucial to identify which patients are suited for CD47-targeted therapy. In this respect, expression of the pro-phagocytic signal SLAMF7 on both macrophages and cancer cells was recently reported to be a requisite for CD47 antibody-mediated phagocytosis. Here, we demonstrate that in fact SLAMF7 expression on cancer cells is not required and does not impact on CD47 antibody therapy. Moreover, SLAMF7 also does not impact on phagocytosis induction by CD20 antibody rituximab nor associates with overall survival of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma patients. In contrast, expression of CD47 negatively impacts on overall and progression free survival. In conclusion, cancer cell expression of SLAMF7 is not required for phagocytosis and, in contrast to CD47 expression, should not be used as selection criterion for CD47-targeted therapy. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Increased Crabp2 levels have been found in various types of cancer, and are associated with poor patients’ survival. Although Crabp2 is found to be overexpressed in lung cancer, its role in metastasis of lung cancer is unclear. In this study, Crabp2 was overexpressed in high-metastatic C10F4 than low-metastatic lung cancer cells. Analysis of clinical samples revealed that high CRABP2 levels were correlated with lymph node metastases, poor overall survival, and increased recurrence. Knockdown of Crabp2 decreased migration, invasion, anoikis resistance, and in vivo metastasis. Crabp2 was co-immunoprecipitated with HuR, and overexpression of Crabp2 increased HuR levels, which promoted integrin β1/FAK/ERK signaling. Inhibition of HuR or integrin β1/FAK/ERK signaling reversed the promoting effect of Crabp2 in migration, invasion, and anoikis resistance. Knockdown of Crabp2 further inhibited the growth of cancer cells as compared with that by gemcitabine or irinotecan alone. The expression of Crabp2 in human lung tumors was correlated with stress marker CHOP. In conclusion, our findings have identified the promoting role of Crabp2 in anoikis resistance and metastasis. CRABP2 may serve as a prognostic marker and targeting CRABP2 may be exploited as a modality to reduce metastasis. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "SPG-56 is a newly isolated glycoprotein from sweet potatoes (Zhongshu NO. 1), but its value for suppressing breast cancer progression remains unknown. This study was designed to investigate the potential anti-cancer effects of SPG-56, which consists of 2.9% sugar and 97.1% protein. The effects of SPG-56 on the proliferation and apoptosis of breast cancer cells were determined using CCK-8 and Hoechst 33342 assays and flow cytometry, after staining with Annexin V and PI respectively. The activities of SPG-56 against breast cancer were examined using female BALB/c nude mice orthotopically implanted with human breast carcinoma cells of the types MCF-7 and 4T1-Luc. The cellular experiments showed that SPG-56 inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of MCF-7 cells dose- and time-dependently. Oral administration of SPG-56 significantly suppressed the development of MCF-7 tumor cells (P < 0.01) as compared with an untreated group. The serum tumor markers CEA, CA125 and CA153 in a 240 mg/kg/d SPG-56 decreased by 54.8%, 91.8%, and 90.3%, respectively. The experiments further demonstrated that SPG-56 inhibited the metastasis of breast cancer in MCF-7 and 4T1-bearing mice by altering the expression of MMP2, MMP9, VEGF, Occludin and Claudin. It is concluded that SPG-56 may have potential as a novel anti-tumor candidate for breast cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Lymph node metastasis is of major prognostic significance for breast cancer. Lymph node metastasis arises at a very early stage in some patients. Using the data downloaded from the TCGA database, we studied the differences between primary tumors with and without lymph node metastasis at the multi-omics level using bioinformatics approaches. Our study found that low mutation and neoantigen burdens correlated with lymph node metastazation of breast cancer. All three conserved domains in TP53 were mutated in lymph node-negative breast cancers, whereas only one domain was mutated in lymph node-positive samples. Mutations in microtubule-related proteins appear to help immune cells recognize tumors and inhibit their lymph node metastasis. Destroying microtubule-related proteins is a potential therapeutic strategy to inhibit lymph node metastasis of breast cancer. As the neoantigens specifically present in lymph node-positive breast cancers, MAPK10, BC9L, TRIM65, CD93, KITLG, CNPPD1, CPED1, CCDC146, TMEM185A, INO80D, and PSMD11 are potential targets for vaccine design. In the tumor microenvironment, reduced numbers of effector immune cells, especially activated memory CD4+ T cells and activated mast cells, facilitate breast cancer metastasis to the lymph nodes. According to transcriptome data, lymph node metastasis was mostly driven by gene mutation rather than by gene expression. Although differential gene expression analysis was based on lymph node metastasis status, many genes were shown to be differentially expressed based on estrogen receptor status. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Fibroblasts turn into cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumour microenvironment. CAFs have recently attracted attention for their function as a regulator of immune cell recruitment and function in addition to their tumour-promoting roles. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of CAFs on monocyte recruitment and macrophage polarization in breast cancer. CAFs, which were α-SMA expressing fibroblasts in contrast to normal fibroblasts (NFs), effectively recruited monocytes. Recruitment of monocytes by CAFs might be mediated by monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) as well as stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) cytokines. CAFs differentiated the recruited monocytes into M2-like macrophages which are capable of exerting their immunosuppressive roles via the PD-1 axis. CAF-educated monocytes exhibited strong immune suppression unlike NF-educated monocytes and enhanced the motility/invasion of breast cancer cells in addition to increasing the expressions of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes and vimentin protein in cancer cells. CAF-educated M1 macrophages displayed increased expression of M2 markers and production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in contrast to decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12 compared with control M1 macrophages; suggesting that CAFs were also able to induce the trans-differentiation of M1 macrophages to M2 macrophages. We then investigated the relationship between the infiltration of CAFs and tumour associated macrophages (TAMs) using tissue samples obtained from breast cancer patients. High grade of CAFs significantly correlated with the number of TAMs in human breast cancer tissue samples. It was also associated with higher Ki-67 proliferation index, and higher tumour volume. This result is in line with our finding of increased breast cancer cell proliferation due to the effects of CAF-educated monocytes in vitro. Our results concluded that CAFs play pivotal roles in sculpturing the tumour microenvironment in breast cancer, and therapeutic strategies to reverse the CAF-mediated immunosuppressive microenvironment should be taken into consideration. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

We construct iCells of four cancers and the corresponding tissue controls and identify the most rewired genes in cancer.

We biologically validate that they have a role in cancer by knockdown experiments followed by cell viability assays.

Our method achieves an accuracy of 96% for RNA-seq and 95% for mixed DNA-seq and RNA-seq identification. Even for a panel of only 94 cancer-related genes, accuracy remains at 82% but decreases when using smaller panels.

The angular spectra of scattering coefficient maps of normal tissues exhibit a spatial feature distinct from those of abnormal tissues. An angular spectrum index to quantify the differences between the normal and abnormal tissues is derived, and its strength in revealing subsurface cancer in ex vivo samples is statistically analyzed.

        fabio:abstract    "Metastatic colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer death. Current options in palliation such as hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) present severe side effects. Recent research efforts suggested the therapeutic use of oxidant-enriched liquid using cold physical plasma. To investigate a clinically accepted treatment regimen, we assessed the antitumor capacity of plasma-treated saline solution. In response to such liquid, CT26 murine colon cancer cells were readily oxidized and showed cell growth with subsequent apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and upregulation of immunogenic cell death (ICD) markers in vitro. This was accompanied by marked morphological changes with re-arrangement of actin fibers and reduced motility. Induction of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype was not observed. Key results were confirmed in MC38 colon and PDA6606 pancreatic cancer cells. Compared to plasma-treated saline, hydrogen peroxide was inferiorly toxic in 3D tumor spheroids but of similar efficacy in 2D models. In vivo, plasma-treated saline decreased tumor burden in Balb/C mice. This was concomitant with elevated numbers of intratumoral macrophages and increased T cell activation following incubation with CT26 cells ex vivo. Being a potential adjuvant for HIPEC therapy, our results suggest oxidizing saline solutions to inactivate colon cancer cells while potentially stimulating antitumor immune responses. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Although solid fuel combustion emissions are known to increase the prevalence of illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer, however, their effect on the eyes is underexplored. This study assesses the acute toxicity of solid fuel combustion emissions on healthy ocular cells and a cancer cell line. Three healthy ocular cell lines (corneal, lens, and retinal epithelial cells) and a cancer cell line (Chinese hamster ovary cells) were exposed to liquid and gas phase emissions from applewood and coal combustion. Following the exposure, real-time cell attachment behavior was monitored for at least 120 hours with electrical cell impedance spectroscopy. The viability of the cells, amount of apoptotic cells, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were quantified with MTT, ApoTox-Glo, and ROS-Glo H 2 O 2 assays, respectively. The results showed that coal emissions compromised the viability of ocular cells more than applewood emissions. Interestingly, the cancer cells, although their viability was not compromised, generated 1.7 to 2.7 times more ROS than healthy cells. This acute exposure study provides compelling proof that biomass combustion emissions compromise the viability of ocular cells and increase ROS generation. The increased ROS generation was fatal for ocular cells, but it promoted the growth of cancer cells. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) include endogenous metabolites that provide information about health and disease which might be useful to develop a better screening method for breast cancer. The goal of this study was to classify mice with and without tumors and compare tumors localized to the mammary pad and tumor cells injected into the iliac artery by differences in VOCs in urine. After 4T1.2 tumor cells were injected into BALB/c mice either in the mammary pad or into the iliac artery, urine was collected, VOCs from urine headspace were concentrated by solid phase microextraction and results were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry quadrupole time-of-flight. Multivariate and univariate statistical analyses were employed to find potential biomarkers for breast cancer and metastatic breast cancer in mice models. A set of six VOCs classified mice with and without tumors with an area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC AUC) of 0.98 (95% confidence interval [0.85, 1.00]) via five-fold cross validation. Classification of mice with tumors in the mammary pad and iliac artery was executed utilizing a different set of six VOCs, with a ROC AUC of 0.96 (95% confidence interval [0.75, 1.00]). © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

In an additional two metastatic colon cancer patients, we detected CD8 + neoantigen-specific cells targeting the mutated SMAD5 and MUC4 proteins.

Moreover, the high drug loading capacity of Cet-SLN was employed to encapsulate photothermal agent indocyanine green (ICG) to finally fabricate a versatile drug delivery system (DDS) able to co-deliver Cet and ICG (Cet-SLN/ICG) for combinational chemo-photothermal therapy of breast cancer. The obtained results clearly demonstrated that Cet-SLN/ICG was well-dispersed nanoparticles with preferable stability under physiological condition. Furthermore, due to the conjugation of Cet, Cet-SLN/ICG could target EGFR which overexpress in MCF-7 cells. Most importantly, both in vitro and in vivo results suggested that compared with Cet or ICG alone, the Cet-SLN/ICG showed superior anticancer efficacy. In conclusion, Cet-SLN/ICG could be a potential platform for effective combinational chemo-photothermal therapy for breast cancer." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The integration of genomic and DNA methylation data has been demonstrated as a powerful strategy in understanding cancer mechanisms and identifying therapeutic targets. The TCGA consortium has mapped DNA methylation in thousands of cancer samples using Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 K BeadChip (Illumina 450 K array) that only covers about 1.5% of CpGs in the human genome. Therefore, increasing the coverage of the DNA methylome would significantly leverage the usage of the TCGA data. Here, we present a new model called EAGLING that can expand the Illumina 450 K array data 18 times to cover about 30% of the CpGs in the human genome. We applied it to analyze 13 cancers in TCGA. By integrating the expanded methylation, gene expression, and somatic mutation data, we identified the genes showing differential patterns in each of the 13 cancers. Many of the triple-evidenced genes identified in majority of the cancers are biomarkers or potential biomarkers. Pan-cancer analysis also revealed the pathways in which the triple-evidenced genes are enriched, which include well known ones as well as new ones, such as axonal guidance signaling pathway and pathways related to inflammatory processing or inflammation response. Triple-evidenced genes, particularly TNXB, RRM2, CELSR3, SLC16A3, FANCI, MMP9, MMP11, SIK1, and TRIM59 showed superior predictive power in both tumor diagnosis and prognosis. These results have demonstrated that the integrative analysis using the expanded methylation data is powerful in identifying critical genes/pathways that may serve as new therapeutic targets. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

However, macrophages make up a majority of immune cell infiltrates into tumors, creating natural targets for immunotherapies able to direct macrophages away from tumor-supportive functions and toward anti-tumor phenotypes. Recent studies demonstrate that toll-like receptors (TLRs) – pathways that quickly trigger early immune responses – play an important role in polarizing macrophages. Here, we present emerging ways in which TLR signaling is being manipulated in macrophages to create new opportunities for cancer immunotherapy. In particular, we discuss approaches to deliver TLR agonists, to leverage biomaterials in these therapies, and to couple TLR-based approaches with other frontline treatments as combination cancer therapies. © 2019" ;

We analyzed the immune profiles, T cell cytotoxicity, and TCR repertoire of peripheral blood, normal lung tissue, and tumor tissue from NSCLC patients. By using bispecific T-cell engager technology to assess the cytotoxicity of T cells, we found that the cytotoxicity of tumor-infiltrated T cells closely correlated with that of peripheral T cells. This correlation was supported by the immune profiles, cytokine production, and results of the TCR repertoire analysis from these specimens. We also found that the cytotoxicity of peripheral T cells has potential as a predictor of the effects of nivolumab in the tumor microenvironment.

This standard procedure relies on the slow radioactivity loss, usually attributed to the limited tumour expression of G6P-phosphatase (G6Pase). However, this classical interpretation intrinsically represents an approximation since, as in all tissues, cancer G6Pase activity is remarkable and is confined to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whose lumen must be reached by phosphorylated FDG to explain its hydrolysis and radioactivity release. The present study tested the impact of G6Pase sequestration on the mathematical description of FDG trafficking and handling in cultured cancer cells. Our data show that accounting for tracer access to the ER configures this compartment as the preferential site of FDG accumulation. This is confirmed by the reticular localization of fluorescent FDG analogues. Remarkably enough, reticular accumulation rate of FDG is dependent upon extracellular glucose availability, thus configuring the same ER as a significant determinant of cancer glucose metabolism. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Although current methods of treatment for cervical cancer can ablate lesions, preventing metastatic disseminations and excessive tissue injuries still remains a major concern. Hence, development of a safer and more efficient treatment modality is of vital importance. Natural products from plants are one of the principal sources of precursors to lead compounds with direct pharmaceutical application across all disease classes. One of these plants is Ficus carica, whose fruit latex, when applied on HPV-induced skin warts, has shown potential as a possible cure for this virus related lesions. This study explores the in vitro biological activities of fig latex and elucidates its possible mechanisms of action on cervical cancer cell lines CaSki and HeLa positive for HPV type 16 and 18, respectively. Our data shows that fig latex inhibits properties that are associated with HPV-positive cervical cancer transformed cells such as rapid growth and invasion and substantially downregulated the expression of p16 and HPV onco-proteins E6, E7. These findings suggest Ficus carica latex has the potential to be used in the development of therapeutic modalities for the possible treatment, cure and prevention of HPV related cervical cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing methods, the diversity and composition of the microbiota from ovarian cancer tissues (25 samples) and normal distal fallopian tube tissues (25 samples) were analyzed. High-throughput sequencing showed that the diversity and richness indexes were significantly decreased in ovarian cancer tissues compared to tissues from normal distal fallopian tubes. The ratio of the two phyla for Proteobacteria/Firmicutes was notably increased in ovarian cancer, which revealed that microbial composition change might be associated with the process of ovarian cancer development. In addition, transcriptome-sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses suggested that the transcriptional profiles were statistically different between ovarian carcinoma and normal distal fallopian tubes. Moreover, a set of genes including 84 different inflammation-associated or immune-associated genes, which had been named as the human antibacterial-response genes were also modulated expression.

        fabio:abstract    "Several pioneering work have established that apart from genetic alterations, epigenetic modifications contribute significantly in tumor progression. Remarkable role of EZH2 in cancer highlights the importance of identifying its targets. Although much emphasis has been placed in recent years in designing drugs and inhibitors targeting EZH2, less effort has been given in exploring its existing targets that will help in understanding the oncogenic role of EZH2 in turn which may provide a more stringent method of targeting EZH2. In the present study, we validated six direct targets of EZH2 that are GPNMB, PMEPA1, CoL5A1, VGLL4, POMT2 and SUMF1 associated with cancer related pathways. Upon EZH2 knockdown, more than two fold increase in the target gene expression was evident. CHIP-qPCR performed in both MCF-7 and MDA-MDA-231 confirmed the in-vivo binding of EZH2 on its identified target. Thirty invasive breast carcinoma cases with their adjacent normal tissues were included in the study. Immunohistochemistry in primary breast tumor tissue array showed tumor dependent expression of EZH2. Array of MERAV expression database revealed the strength of association of EZH2 with its target genes. Real time PCR performed with RNA extracted from breast tumor tissues further authenticated the existing negative correlation between EZH2 and its target genes. Pearson correlation coefficient & statistical significance computed using the matrix provided in the database strengthened the negative correlation between identified target genes and EZH2. KM plotter analysis showed improved relapse-free survival with increased expression of PMEPA1, POMT2, VGLL4 and SUMF1 in breast cancer patients indicating their therapeutic potential. While investigating the relevance of these target genes, different mutations of them were found in breast cancer patients. Seeking the clinical relevance of our study, following our recent publication that reports the role of EZH2 in nicotine-mediated breast cancer development and progression, we observed significant reduced expression of SUMF1 in breast cancer patient samples with smoking history in comparison to never-smoked patient samples. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we report that TOP1MT is overexpressed in cancer tissues and demonstrate that TOP1MT deficiency attenuates tumor growth in human and mouse models of colon and liver cancer. Due to their mitochondrial dysfunction, TOP1MT-KO cells become addicted to glycolysis, which limits synthetic building blocks and energy supply required for the proliferation of cancer cells in a nutrient-deprived tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, we show that TOP1MT associates with mitoribosomal subunits, ensuring optimal mitochondrial translation and assembly of oxidative phosphorylation complexes that are critical for sustaining tumor growth. The TOP1MT genomic signature profile, based on Top1mt-KO liver cancers, is correlated with enhanced survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Our results highlight the importance of TOP1MT for tumor development, providing a potential rationale to develop TOP1MT-targeted drugs as anticancer therapies. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

A new data integrative approach, based on graphical models, was applied on our multi-modal –omics, and clinical data cohort of metastatic melanoma patients. We found that response to chemotherapy is directly linked to ten gene expression, four methylation variables and PARP1 SNP rs1805407. PARP1 is a DNA repair gene critical for chemotherapy response and for which FDA-approved inhibitors are clinically available (olaparib). We demonstrated that two PARP inhibitors (ABT-888 and olaparib) make SNP carrier cancer cells of various histologic subtypes more sensitive to alkylating agents, but they have no effect in wild-type cells. Furthermore, PARP1 inhibitors act synergistically with chemotherapy in SNP carrier cells (especially in ovarian cancer for which olaparib is FDA-approved), but they are additive at best in wild-type cancer cells. Taken together, our results suggest that the combination of chemotherapy and PARP1 inhibition may benefit the carriers of rs1805407 in the future and may be used in personalized therapy strategies to select patients that are more likely to respond to PARP inhibitors. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Cancer remains one of the biggest threats to human society. There are massive demands for compounds to selectively kill cancerous cells. Earlier studies have shown that bovine α -lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells (BAMLET) becomes cytotoxic against cancer cells in complex with oleic acid {Hoque, M. et. al., PLoSOne8, e68390 (2013)}. In our study, we obtained bovine α-lactalbumin complexed with lanthanum ion (La 3+ -B-α-LA) and determined its high resolution crystal structure. The natural calcium binding site of bovine α-lactalbumin is replaced by lanthanum. The La 3+ complex formation by B-α-apo-LA was also supported by various biophysical methods. Interestingly, our complex, La 3+ -B-α-LA exhibits much greater anticancer activity against breast cancer cells as compared to the reported BAMLET-oleic acid complex. This study shows that La 3+ -B-α-LA complex is preferentially more toxic to MCF-7 cells as compared to KB (oral cancer) and HeLa (cervical) cells, while almost non-toxic to the healthy cells that we studied. Our data indicates that the cytotoxicity of La 3+ -B-α-LA against cancer cells is through apoptotic path way. The higher anticancer activity of La 3+ -B-α-LA is attributable to the requisite structural changes induced in the protein by La 3+ binding as supported by the crystal structure of the complex. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

However, no studies have evaluated vascular pain in patients with colorectal cancer in relation to peripheral venous administration of chemotherapy with or without oxaliplatin. We evaluated oxaliplatin-induced vascular pain using subjective and objective methods. We determined if oxaliplatin induced vascular pain in patients with colorectal cancer using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and a PainVision PS-2100 device. We compared VAS score between chemotherapy regimens with or without oxaliplatin, and between genders. We also examined the correlations of VAS score with pain intensity examined by the PainVision PS-2100, and with age and vessel diameter. A total of 98 patients with colorectal cancer were enrolled in this study, including 78 patients who received oxaliplatin via peripheral venous administration and 20 who received chemotherapy without oxaliplatin. The median VAS scores in patients with and without oxaliplatin were 36.5 (interquartile range 9.0–60.0) and 0 (0–4.0), respectively (P < 0.001), and the median pain intensities according to PainVision were 43.5 (14.3–98) and 36.5 (9.3–58.5), respectively (P < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between VAS and pain intensity (r = 0.584), but no correlation between VAS score and age (r = −0.174) or vessel diameter (r = −0.107).

One of the emerging techniques with tremendous power for lung cancer therapy is magnetic aerosol drug targeting (MADT). The use of a permanent magnet for effective drug delivery in a desired location throughout the lung requires extensive optimization, but it has not been addressed yet. In the present study, the possibility of using a permanent magnet for trapping the particles on a lung tumor is evaluated numerically in the Weibel's model from G0 to G3. The effect of different parameters is considered on the efficiency of particle deposition in a tumor located on a distant position of the lung bronchi and bronchioles. Also, the effective position of the magnetic source, tumor size, and location are the objectives for particle deposition. The results show that a limited particle deposition occurs on the lung branches in passive targeting. However, the incorporation of a permanent magnet next to the tumor enhanced the particle deposition fraction on G2 to up to 49% for the particles of 7 µm diameter. Optimizing the magnet size could also improve the particle deposition fraction by 68%. It was also shown that the utilization of MADT is essential for effective drug delivery to the tumors located on the lower wall of airway branches given the dominance of the air velocity and resultant drag force in this region. The results demonstrated the high competence and necessity of MADT as a noninvasive drug delivery method for lung cancer therapy." ;

Adjuvant chemotherapy has significantly reduced mortality but increased cognitive impairments, including attention function, making quality of life issues a crucial concern. This study enrolled nineteen breast cancer patients who were treated with standard chemotherapy within 6 months and 20 sex-matched healthy controls to investigate the brain effects of chemotherapy. All participants underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) with mean fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (mfALFF) analysis and were correlated with neuropsychological tests, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised (CAMS-R), and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), to explore the possible underlying mechanism of cognitive alternations. We found increased mfALFF over the frontoparietal lobe and decreased mfALFF over the occipital lobe in the cancer patients compared with the healthy controls; the altered brain regions may be associated with the dorsal attention network (DAN) and may be explained by a compensatory mechanism. Both MMSE and CAMS-R scores showed a positive correlation with mfALFF in the occipital lobe but a negative correlation in the frontoparietal lobe. By contrast, IES-R scores showed a positive correlation with mfALFF in the frontoparietal lobe but a negative correlation in the occipital lobe. These alterations are potentially related to the effects of both chemotherapy and psychological distress.

Mutations that occur in certain splicing factor genes themselves have been implicated in many cancers, particularly myelodysplastic syndromes. Small molecules that target splicing factors have been developed as therapies to preferentially induce apoptosis in these cancer cells.

There have been many attempts to identify markers and key pathways induced throughout EMT but the process is complex and depends on the cancer type and tumour microenvironment. Here we used the colon cancer cell line HT29, which stably overexpressed Snail, the key transcription factor in early EMT, as a model for colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with a pro-metastatic phenotype. We investigated miRNA expression regulation during that phenotypic switching. We found that overexpression of Snail in HT29 cells triggered significant changes in individual miRNA levels but did not change the global efficiency of miRNA processing. Snail abundance repressed the expression of miR-192 and miR-194 and increased miR-205, let-7i and SNORD13 levels. These identified changes correlated with the reported transcriptomic alterations in Snail-overexpressing HT29 cells. We also investigated how Snail affected the miRNA content of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from HT29 cells.

        fabio:abstract    "Solid malignancies are associated with the development of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP). This study aimed to evaluate the risk factors for PJP among patients with lung cancer. This retrospective case-control study compared patients who had lung cancer with PJP (n = 112) or without PJP (n = 336) matched according to age, sex, histopathology, and stage. PJP definition was based on (i) positive PCR or direct immunofluorescence results for pneumocystis, (ii) clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities that were consistent with a pneumonic process, and (iii) received targeted PJP treatment. The development of PJP was associated with radiotherapy (RTx), concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRTx), lymphopenia, and prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (20 mg of prednisolone equivalent per day for ≥3 weeks). Multivariate analysis revealed independent associations with prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06–3.63; p = 0.032) and CCRTx (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.27–3.43; p = 0.004). Steroid use was frequently related to RTx pneumonitis or esophagitis (29 patients, 43.3%). Prolonged high-dose steroid therapy and CCRTx were risk factors for PJP development among patients with lung cancer. As these patients had a poor prognosis, clinicians should consider PJP prophylaxis for high-risk patients with lung cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we compared The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) breast cancer genomic datasets (array and next generation sequencing (NGS) data) in detecting genomic alterations in clinically relevant genes. We performed an in silico analysis to determine the concordance in the frequencies of actionable mutations and copy number alterations/aberrations (CNAs) in the two most common breast cancer histologies, invasive lobular and invasive ductal carcinoma. We found that targeted sequencing identified a larger number of mutational hotspots and clinically significant amplifications that would have been missed by WES and SNP arrays in many actionable genes such as PIK3CA, EGFR, AKT3, FGFR1, ERBB2, ERBB3 and ESR1. The striking differences between the number of mutational hotspots and CNAs generated from these platforms highlight a number of factors that should be considered in the interpretation of array and NGS-based genomic data for precision medicine. Targeted panel sequencing was preferable to WES to define the full spectrum of somatic mutations present in a tumor. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Several oxaliplatin transporters were previously identified but their relative contributions to determining oxaliplatin tumour responses and gastrointestinal tumour cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin remains unclear. We studied clinical associations between tumour expression of oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes and patient response to oxaliplatin, then experimentally verified associations found with MRP2 in models of human gastrointestinal cancer. Among 18 oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes, MRP2 was the only one to be differentially expressed in the tumours of colorectal cancer patients who did or did not respond to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Over-expression of MRP2 (endogenously in HepG2 and PANC-1 cells, or induced by stable transfection of HEK293 cells) decreased oxaliplatin accumulation and cytotoxicity but those deficits were reversed by inhibition of MRP2 with myricetin or siRNA knockdown. Mice bearing subcutaneous HepG2 tumour xenografts were sensitised to oxaliplatin antitumour activity by concurrent myricetin treatment with little or no increase in toxicity. In conclusion, MRP2 limits oxaliplatin accumulation and response in human gastrointestinal cancer. Screening tumour MRP2 expression levels, to select patients for treatment with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy alone or in combination with a MRP2 inhibitor, could improve treatment outcomes. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

We compare optimized gene signatures for cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin responses in the same cell lines and validate each signature using data from patients with cancer. Supervised support vector machine learning is used to derive gene sets whose expression is related to the cell line GI50 values by backwards feature selection with cross-validation. Specific genes and functional pathways distinguishing sensitive from resistant cell lines are identified by contrasting signatures obtained at extreme and median GI50 thresholds. Ensembles of gene signatures at different thresholds are combined to reduce the dependence on specific GI50 values for predicting drug responses. The most accurate gene signatures for each platin are: cisplatin: BARD1, BCL2, BCL2L1, CDKN2C, FAAP24, FEN1, MAP3K1, MAPK13, MAPK3, NFKB1, NFKB2, SLC22A5, SLC31A2, TLR4, and TWIST1; carboplatin: AKT1, EIF3K, ERCC1, GNGT1, GSR, MTHFR, NEDD4L, NLRP1, NRAS, RAF1, SGK1, TIGD1, TP53, VEGFB, and VEGFC; and oxaliplatin: BRAF, FCGR2A, IGF1, MSH2, NAGK, NFE2L2, NQO1, PANK3, SLC47A1, SLCO1B1, and UGT1A1. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with bladder, ovarian, and colorectal cancer were used to test the cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin signatures, resulting in 71.0%, 60.2%, and 54.5% accuracies in predicting disease recurrence and 59%, 61%, and 72% accuracies in predicting remission, respectively. One cisplatin signature predicted 100% of recurrence in non-smoking patients with bladder cancer (57% disease-free; N = 19), and 79% recurrence in smokers (62% disease-free; N = 35).

MTH1 dephosphorylates oxidized nucleotides, thereby preventing their incorporation into DNA and protecting tumour cells from oxidative DNA damage. Inhibitors of MTH1 (TH588 and (S)-crizotinib) were shown to reduce cancer cell viability. However, the MTH1-dependency of the anti-cancer effects of these drugs has recently been questioned. Here, we have assessed anti-tumour effects of TH588 and (S)-crizotinib in patient-derived 3D colorectal cancer cultures. Hypoxia and reoxygenation – conditions that increase intracellular ROS levels – increased sensitivity to (S)-crizotinib, but not to TH588. (S)-crizotinib reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-MET and ErbB3 whereas TH588 induced a mitotic cell cycle arrest, which was not affected by adding ROS-modulating compounds. Furthermore, we show that both compounds induced DNA damage that could not be prevented by adding the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Moreover, adding ROS-modulating compounds did not alter the reduction in viability in response to TH588 and (S)-crizotinib. We conclude that TH588 and (S)-crizotinib have very clear and distinct anti-tumour effects in 3D colorectal cancer cultures, but that these effects most likely occur through distinct and ROS-independent mechanisms. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Histological iron imaging and contrast-agent free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect these deposits, but their presence in human cancer, and correlation with immunotherapeutic response is largely untested. Here, primarily using these iron imaging approaches, we evaluated the spatial distribution of polarized macrophage populations containing high endogenous levels of iron in preclinical murine models and human breast cancer, and used them as metabolic biomarkers to correlate TAM infiltration with response to immunotherapy in preclinical trials. Macrophage-targeted inhibition of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) by immunotherapy was confirmed to inhibit macrophage accumulation and slow mammary tumor growth in mouse models while also reducing hemosiderin iron-laden TAM accumulation as measured by both iron histology and in vivo iron MRI (FeMRI). Spatial profiling of TAM iron deposit infiltration defined regions of maximal accumulation and response to the CSF1R inhibitor, and revealed differences between microenvironments of human cancer according to levels of polarized macrophage iron accumulation in stromal margins. We therefore demonstrate that iron deposition serves as an endogenous metabolic imaging biomarker of TAM infiltration in breast cancer that has high translational potential for evaluation of immunotherapeutic response. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

The AP2 family also acts as a tumor suppressor. Here we found that p73 and AP2 are able to activate NEU4, a neuraminidase gene, which removes the terminal sialic acid residues from cancer-associated glycans. Under serum starvation, NEU4 was up-regulated and one of the NEU4 target glycans, sialyl Lewis X, was decreased, whereas p73 and AP2 were up-regulated. Sialyl Lewis X levels were not, however, decreased under starvation conditions in p73- or AP2-knockdown cells. p53 and AP2 underwent protein-protein interactions, exerting synergistic effects to activate p21, and interaction of p53 with AP2 was lost in cells expressing the L350P mutation of p53. The homologous residues in p63 and p73 are L423 and L377, respectively. The synergistic effect of p53/p63 with AP2 to activate genes was lost with the L350P/L423P mutation in p53/p63, but p73 bearing the L377P mutation was able to interact with AP2 and exerted its normal synergistic effects. We propose that p73 and AP2 synergistically activate the NEU4 promoter in colon cancer cells. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Treatment with increasing concentrations of HspNPs (25, 50, 75 and 100 µg/mL) resulted in 9.1-, 7-, 12.5- and 12.7-fold in increase in apoptotic cell number. Optimum doses of Hsp and HspNPs were found to increase oxidative damage in C6 glioma cells. MDA levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were found to be significantly elevated at 75 and 100 µg/mL exposure concentration of HspNPs with (p = .002) and (p = .018), respectively for 48-h treatment.

GO exhibits pH-dependent fluorescence emission in the visible/near-infrared, providing a possibility of molecular imaging and pH-sensing. It is also water soluble and has a substantial platform for functionalization, allowing for the delivery of multiple therapeutics. GO physical properties are modified to enhance cellular internalization, producing fluorescent nanoflakes with low (<15%) cytotoxicity at the imaging concentrations of 15 μg/mL. As a result, at lower flake sizes GO rapidly internalizes into HeLa cells with the following 70% fluorescence based clearance at 24 h, assessed by its characteristic emission in red/near-IR. pH-dependence of GO emission is utilized to provide the sensing of acidic extracellular environments of cancer cells. The results demonstrate diminishing green/red (550/630 nm) fluorescence intensity ratios for HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells in comparison to HEK-293 healthy cells suggesting a potential use of GO as a non-invasive optical sensor for cancer microenvironments.

        fabio:abstract    "Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells, represents early stages of metastasis and is a promising target in colorectal cancer (CRC) therapy. There have been many attempts to identify markers and key pathways induced throughout EMT but the process is complex and depends on the cancer type and tumour microenvironment. Here we used the colon cancer cell line HT29, which stably overexpressed Snail, the key transcription factor in early EMT, as a model for colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with a pro-metastatic phenotype. We investigated miRNA expression regulation during that phenotypic switching. We found that overexpression of Snail in HT29 cells triggered significant changes in individual miRNA levels but did not change the global efficiency of miRNA processing. Snail abundance repressed the expression of miR-192 and miR-194 and increased miR-205, let-7i and SNORD13 levels. These identified changes correlated with the reported transcriptomic alterations in Snail-overexpressing HT29 cells. We also investigated how Snail affected the miRNA content of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from HT29 cells. Our data suggest that the presence of Snail significantly alters the complex mRNA/miRNA interactions in the early steps of metastasis and also has an impact on the content of EVs released from HT29 cells. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Solid malignancies are associated with the development of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP). This study aimed to evaluate the risk factors for PJP among patients with lung cancer. This retrospective case-control study compared patients who had lung cancer with PJP (n = 112) or without PJP (n = 336) matched according to age, sex, histopathology, and stage. PJP definition was based on (i) positive PCR or direct immunofluorescence results for pneumocystis, (ii) clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities that were consistent with a pneumonic process, and (iii) received targeted PJP treatment. The development of PJP was associated with radiotherapy (RTx), concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRTx), lymphopenia, and prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (20 mg of prednisolone equivalent per day for ≥3 weeks). Multivariate analysis revealed independent associations with prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06–3.63; p = 0.032) and CCRTx (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.27–3.43; p = 0.004). Steroid use was frequently related to RTx pneumonitis or esophagitis (29 patients, 43.3%). Prolonged high-dose steroid therapy and CCRTx were risk factors for PJP development among patients with lung cancer. As these patients had a poor prognosis, clinicians should consider PJP prophylaxis for high-risk patients with lung cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we compared The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) breast cancer genomic datasets (array and next generation sequencing (NGS) data) in detecting genomic alterations in clinically relevant genes. We performed an in silico analysis to determine the concordance in the frequencies of actionable mutations and copy number alterations/aberrations (CNAs) in the two most common breast cancer histologies, invasive lobular and invasive ductal carcinoma. We found that targeted sequencing identified a larger number of mutational hotspots and clinically significant amplifications that would have been missed by WES and SNP arrays in many actionable genes such as PIK3CA, EGFR, AKT3, FGFR1, ERBB2, ERBB3 and ESR1. The striking differences between the number of mutational hotspots and CNAs generated from these platforms highlight a number of factors that should be considered in the interpretation of array and NGS-based genomic data for precision medicine. Targeted panel sequencing was preferable to WES to define the full spectrum of somatic mutations present in a tumor. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Several oxaliplatin transporters were previously identified but their relative contributions to determining oxaliplatin tumour responses and gastrointestinal tumour cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin remains unclear. We studied clinical associations between tumour expression of oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes and patient response to oxaliplatin, then experimentally verified associations found with MRP2 in models of human gastrointestinal cancer. Among 18 oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes, MRP2 was the only one to be differentially expressed in the tumours of colorectal cancer patients who did or did not respond to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Over-expression of MRP2 (endogenously in HepG2 and PANC-1 cells, or induced by stable transfection of HEK293 cells) decreased oxaliplatin accumulation and cytotoxicity but those deficits were reversed by inhibition of MRP2 with myricetin or siRNA knockdown. Mice bearing subcutaneous HepG2 tumour xenografts were sensitised to oxaliplatin antitumour activity by concurrent myricetin treatment with little or no increase in toxicity. In conclusion, MRP2 limits oxaliplatin accumulation and response in human gastrointestinal cancer. Screening tumour MRP2 expression levels, to select patients for treatment with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy alone or in combination with a MRP2 inhibitor, could improve treatment outcomes. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

We compare optimized gene signatures for cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin responses in the same cell lines and validate each signature using data from patients with cancer. Supervised support vector machine learning is used to derive gene sets whose expression is related to the cell line GI50 values by backwards feature selection with cross-validation. Specific genes and functional pathways distinguishing sensitive from resistant cell lines are identified by contrasting signatures obtained at extreme and median GI50 thresholds. Ensembles of gene signatures at different thresholds are combined to reduce the dependence on specific GI50 values for predicting drug responses. The most accurate gene signatures for each platin are: cisplatin: BARD1, BCL2, BCL2L1, CDKN2C, FAAP24, FEN1, MAP3K1, MAPK13, MAPK3, NFKB1, NFKB2, SLC22A5, SLC31A2, TLR4, and TWIST1; carboplatin: AKT1, EIF3K, ERCC1, GNGT1, GSR, MTHFR, NEDD4L, NLRP1, NRAS, RAF1, SGK1, TIGD1, TP53, VEGFB, and VEGFC; and oxaliplatin: BRAF, FCGR2A, IGF1, MSH2, NAGK, NFE2L2, NQO1, PANK3, SLC47A1, SLCO1B1, and UGT1A1. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with bladder, ovarian, and colorectal cancer were used to test the cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin signatures, resulting in 71.0%, 60.2%, and 54.5% accuracies in predicting disease recurrence and 59%, 61%, and 72% accuracies in predicting remission, respectively. One cisplatin signature predicted 100% of recurrence in non-smoking patients with bladder cancer (57% disease-free; N = 19), and 79% recurrence in smokers (62% disease-free; N = 35).

MTH1 dephosphorylates oxidized nucleotides, thereby preventing their incorporation into DNA and protecting tumour cells from oxidative DNA damage. Inhibitors of MTH1 (TH588 and (S)-crizotinib) were shown to reduce cancer cell viability. However, the MTH1-dependency of the anti-cancer effects of these drugs has recently been questioned. Here, we have assessed anti-tumour effects of TH588 and (S)-crizotinib in patient-derived 3D colorectal cancer cultures. Hypoxia and reoxygenation – conditions that increase intracellular ROS levels – increased sensitivity to (S)-crizotinib, but not to TH588. (S)-crizotinib reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-MET and ErbB3 whereas TH588 induced a mitotic cell cycle arrest, which was not affected by adding ROS-modulating compounds. Furthermore, we show that both compounds induced DNA damage that could not be prevented by adding the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Moreover, adding ROS-modulating compounds did not alter the reduction in viability in response to TH588 and (S)-crizotinib. We conclude that TH588 and (S)-crizotinib have very clear and distinct anti-tumour effects in 3D colorectal cancer cultures, but that these effects most likely occur through distinct and ROS-independent mechanisms. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Histological iron imaging and contrast-agent free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect these deposits, but their presence in human cancer, and correlation with immunotherapeutic response is largely untested. Here, primarily using these iron imaging approaches, we evaluated the spatial distribution of polarized macrophage populations containing high endogenous levels of iron in preclinical murine models and human breast cancer, and used them as metabolic biomarkers to correlate TAM infiltration with response to immunotherapy in preclinical trials. Macrophage-targeted inhibition of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) by immunotherapy was confirmed to inhibit macrophage accumulation and slow mammary tumor growth in mouse models while also reducing hemosiderin iron-laden TAM accumulation as measured by both iron histology and in vivo iron MRI (FeMRI). Spatial profiling of TAM iron deposit infiltration defined regions of maximal accumulation and response to the CSF1R inhibitor, and revealed differences between microenvironments of human cancer according to levels of polarized macrophage iron accumulation in stromal margins. We therefore demonstrate that iron deposition serves as an endogenous metabolic imaging biomarker of TAM infiltration in breast cancer that has high translational potential for evaluation of immunotherapeutic response. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

The AP2 family also acts as a tumor suppressor. Here we found that p73 and AP2 are able to activate NEU4, a neuraminidase gene, which removes the terminal sialic acid residues from cancer-associated glycans. Under serum starvation, NEU4 was up-regulated and one of the NEU4 target glycans, sialyl Lewis X, was decreased, whereas p73 and AP2 were up-regulated. Sialyl Lewis X levels were not, however, decreased under starvation conditions in p73- or AP2-knockdown cells. p53 and AP2 underwent protein-protein interactions, exerting synergistic effects to activate p21, and interaction of p53 with AP2 was lost in cells expressing the L350P mutation of p53. The homologous residues in p63 and p73 are L423 and L377, respectively. The synergistic effect of p53/p63 with AP2 to activate genes was lost with the L350P/L423P mutation in p53/p63, but p73 bearing the L377P mutation was able to interact with AP2 and exerted its normal synergistic effects. We propose that p73 and AP2 synergistically activate the NEU4 promoter in colon cancer cells. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Treatment of C6 glioma cells with HspNPs for 24 and 48 h resulted in dose- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability, with approximate IC50 of 28 and 21 μg/mL, respectively (p = .036 for 24 h, p = .025 for 48 h). The percentage of PCNA positive cells decreased to 20% and 10%, respectively, for Hsp- and HspNP-treated cells at concentration of 100 µg/mL. Treatment with increasing concentrations of HspNPs (25, 50, 75 and 100 µg/mL) resulted in 9.1-, 7-, 12.5- and 12.7-fold in increase in apoptotic cell number. Optimum doses of Hsp and HspNPs were found to increase oxidative damage in C6 glioma cells. MDA levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were found to be significantly elevated at 75 and 100 µg/mL exposure concentration of HspNPs with (p = .002) and (p = .018), respectively for 48-h treatment.

GO exhibits pH-dependent fluorescence emission in the visible/near-infrared, providing a possibility of molecular imaging and pH-sensing. It is also water soluble and has a substantial platform for functionalization, allowing for the delivery of multiple therapeutics. GO physical properties are modified to enhance cellular internalization, producing fluorescent nanoflakes with low (<15%) cytotoxicity at the imaging concentrations of 15 μg/mL. As a result, at lower flake sizes GO rapidly internalizes into HeLa cells with the following 70% fluorescence based clearance at 24 h, assessed by its characteristic emission in red/near-IR. pH-dependence of GO emission is utilized to provide the sensing of acidic extracellular environments of cancer cells. The results demonstrate diminishing green/red (550/630 nm) fluorescence intensity ratios for HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells in comparison to HEK-293 healthy cells suggesting a potential use of GO as a non-invasive optical sensor for cancer microenvironments.

A total of 19,785 newly diagnosed CC patients were registered during 2010–2016, among them only 16,946 (85.6%) with primary CC tumor. There was no difference in treatment modality between DM and non-DM patients. However intergroup assessment showed that type 2DM have significantly higher rate of mortality in both overall mortality (28.3%) and CC-specific (11.7%) as compared to Type 1DM (17.3%; 5.5%) and non DM patients (12.7%; 9.1%) (p < 0.001). Within group assessments showed that Type 2DM patients have better quality of life (mean 7.13 ± 3.67) (p < 0.001) and less distress levels (mean 2.41 ± 0.63) (p < 0.011) as compared to type1 DM (meant 10.54 ± 2.11; 3.19 ± 1.07). This study concluded that T2DM prognostic effect still remained after adjusting demographic and clinical parameters. Type 1 diabetes mellitus showed better OS and CSS then type2 DM. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Despite the widening range of high-throughput platforms and exponential growth of generated data volume, the validation of biomarkers discovered from large-scale data remains a challenging field. In order to tackle cancer heterogeneity and comply with the data dimensionality, a number of network and pathway approaches were invented but rarely systematically applied to this task. We propose a new method, called NEAmarker, for finding sensitive and robust biomarkers at the pathway level. scores from network enrichment analysis transform the original space of altered genes into a lower-dimensional space of pathways. These dimensions are then correlated with phenotype variables. The method was first tested using in vitro data from three anti-cancer drug screens and then on clinical data of The Cancer Genome Atlas. It proved superior to the single-gene and alternative enrichment analyses in terms of (1) universal applicability to different data types with a possibility of cross-platform integration, (2) consistency of the discovered correlates between independent drug screens, and (3) ability to explain differential survival of treated patients. Our new screen of anti-cancer compounds validated the performance of multivariate models of drug sensitivity. The previously proposed methods of enrichment analysis could achieve comparable levels of performance in certain tests. However, only our method could discover predictors of both in vitro response and patient survival given administration of the same drug. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

SPIONs entrapped in the core of the nanocomplex may act as a hyperthermia agent and generate localized heat upon excitation with an alternating magnetic field (AMF), thus enabling a thermo-chemotherapy strategy for cancer treatment. Accordingly, the cytotoxic effect and the mode of cell death triggered by the nanocomplex in combination with AMF were evaluated on two different cancer cell lines with various folate receptor (FR) expression levels, including KB nasopharyngeal cancer cells overexpressing FRs as the model and MCF-7 breast cancer cells with low level of FRs as the blank sample. The obtained results showed that KB cell death was greater than the cell death observed in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, a majority of cell death in both cell lines were related to apoptosis when the folate-modified nanocomplex was used instated of the non-folate-modified nanocomplex. Therefore, functionalizing the nanocomplex with folate modulated the response to thermo-chemotherapy by shifting the cell death pathways toward apoptosis." ;

We examined TILs grades of pretreatment cancer tissue specimens and residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab and determined the predictive utility of the TILs grade in pathological complete response (pCR) and the prognostic power of TILs in HER2-positive breast cancer. This cohort study included 128 HER2-positive breast cancer who received NAC with trastuzumab. TILs grading of the tumor stroma in pretreatment biopsy specimens and residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab was categorized as low, intermediate, and high based on the criteria of the International Working Group. In current study, the pCR rate was 64.8%, and the Relapse-free survival (RFS) was significantly worse in the non-pCR group than in the pCR group. The pCR rate correlated with the TILs grade in pretreatment tumors. In 45 non-pCR patients, TILs grade was higher in the residual tumors than in the pretreatment tumors. The RFS was significantly better in residual tumors with high TILs grade than those with low TILs grade (p = 0.033). In conclusion, assessment of the TILs grade in residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab might be necessary to determine patients with good prognosis among those who do not achieve pCR. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

However, their clinical importance in gallbladder cancer has rarely been explored. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of surgical intervention and the effectiveness of preoperative test on neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) for predicting the prognosis in gallbladder cancer patients. In this study, a total of 255 gallbladder cancer patients were retrospectively selected. For each patient, we recorded his/her treatment algorithm (with or without surgery) and their preoperative inflammatory biomarkers, as well as their detailed survival information for 5 years. A total of 216 patients received surgical intervention and the other 39 chose conservative treatment. The median survival time was 4.6 months for non-surgical group (P < 0.001), and 12.2 months for surgical intervention group. Among the surgical group, ROC analysis showed the AUC of NLR, PLR and MLR were 0.675 (95% CI: 0.600 to 0.751, P < 0.001), 0.599 (95% CI: 0.520 to 0.677, P = 0.017) and 0.607 (95% CI: 0.529 to 0.686, P = 0.009), respectively.

        fabio:abstract    "Most targeting strategies of anticancer drug delivery systems (DDSs) rely on the surface functionalization of nanocarriers with specific ligands, which trigger the internalization in cancer cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The endocytosis implies the entrapment of DDSs in acidic vesicles (endosomes and lysosomes) and their eventual ejection by exocytosis. This process, intrinsic to eukaryotic cells, is one of the main drawbacks of DDSs because it reduces the drug bioavailability in the intracellular environment. The escape of DDSs from the acidic vesicles is, therefore, crucial to enhance the therapeutic performance at low drug dose. To this end, we developed a multifunctionalized DDS that combines high specificity towards cancer cells with endosomal escape capabilities. Doxorubicin-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles were functionalized with polyethylenimine, a polymer commonly used to induce endosomal rupture, and hyaluronic acid, which binds to CD44 receptors, overexpressed in cancer cells. We show irrefutable proof that the developed DDS can escape the endosomal pathway upon polymeric functionalization. Interestingly, the combination of the two polymers resulted in higher endosomal escape efficiency than the polyethylenimine coating alone. Hyaluronic acid additionally provides the system with cancer targeting capability and enzymatically controlled drug release. Thanks to this multifunctionality, the engineered DDS had cytotoxicity comparable to the pure drug whilst displaying high specificity towards cancer cells. The polymeric engineering here developed enhances the performance of DDS at low drug dose, holding great potential for anticancer therapeutic applications. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Using multiple aggressive murine models of triple-negative breast cancer, we have recently demonstrated that the early administration of oncolytic Maraba virus (MRB) prior to surgical resection of the primary tumor is sufficient to minimize the metastatic burden, protect against tumor rechallenge, cure a fraction of the mice and sensitize refractory tumors to immune checkpoint blockade without the need for further treatment. Here, we apply our surgical model to other OVs: Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Adenovirus (Ad), Reovirus (Reo) and Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and show that all of the tested OVs could positively change the outcome of the treated animals. The growth of the primary and secondary tumors was differently affected by the various OVs and most of the viruses conferred survival benefits in this neoadjuvant setting despite the absence of direct treatment following rechallenge.

Recent data indicate that p130Cas association to ErbB2 protects ErbB2 from degradation, thus enhancing tumorigenesis. Therefore, inhibiting p130Cas/ErbB2 interaction might represent a new therapeutic strategy to target breast cancer. Here we demonstrate by performing Molecular Modeling, Molecular Dynamics, dot blot, ELISA and fluorescence quenching experiments, that p130Cas binds directly to ErbB2. Then, by structure-based virtual screening, we identified two potential inhibitors of p130Cas/ErbB2 interaction. Their experimental validation was performed in vitro and in ErbB2-positive breast cancer cellular models. The results highlight that both compounds interfere with p130Cas/ErbB2 binding and significantly affect cell proliferation and sensitivity to Trastuzumab. Overall, this study identifies p130Cas/ErbB2 complex as a potential breast cancer target revealing new therapeutic perspectives for protein-protein interaction (PPI). © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

A large number of clinical applications have revealed that Trametes robiniophila Μurr. (Huaier) exhibits an anti-tumour effect. However, loss of the bioactive components of Huaier during the extraction procedure with water is unavoidable, and the underlying mechanism of the anti-cancer effect of Huaier remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer effect of Huaier n-butanol extract, which contained 51.4% total flavonoids, on HGC27, MGC803, and AGS human GC cell lines in vitro. At a low concentration, Huaier n-butanol extract inhibited the growth of these GC cell types, induced cell cycle arrest and reduced cell metastasis. Moreover, Huaier n-butanol extract suppressed the c-Myc-Bmi1 signalling pathway, and overexpression of Bmi1 reversed the effects of Huaier n-butanol extract on GC cells. Thus, our findings indicate that Huaier n-butanol extract suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of GC cells via a c-Myc-Bmi1-mediated approach, providing a new perspective for our understanding of the anti-tumour effects of Huaier. These results suggest that Huaier n-butanol extract could be an attractive therapeutic adjuvant for the treatment of human GC. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

In the present study, we screened the anticancer potential of supernatant metabolites from eight native haloarchaeal strains obtained from a culture collection in Iran. Five human cancer cell lines including breast, lung, prostate and also human fibroblast cells as the normal control were used in the present study. Moreover, to evaluate the anti-tumor effect of the selected supernatant, inhibition of sphere formation and tumor development was assessed in-vitro and in-vivo, respectively. Among all strains, supernatant metabolites from Halobacterium salinarum IBRC M10715 had the most potent cytotoxic effect on prostate cancer cell lines (IC50 = 0.5 mg/mL) without any effects on normal cells. It significantly increased both early and late apoptosis (about 11% and 9%, respectively) in the androgen-dependent PC3 cell line, reduced sphere formation ability of DU145 and PC3 cells with down-regulation of SOX2 gene expression. Furthermore, our results revealed that tumors developed in nude mice significantly shrank post intratumor injection of metabolites of the haloarchaeal strain. In conclusion, we suggested here for the first time that supernatant metabolites from Halobacterium salinarum IBRC M10715 could be a novel component against prostate cancer in-vitro and in-vivo with remarkable reduction in stem-like properties of tumor. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

The main HNSCC risk factors are tobacco, excessive alcohol use, and the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV positive (+) cancers are etiologically different from other HNSCC and often show better prognosis. The current knowledge regarding HNSCC miRNA profiles is still incomplete especially in the context of HPV+ cancer. Thus, we analyzed 61 freshly collected primary oral (OSCC) and oropharyngeal (OPSCC) SCC samples. HPV DNA and RNA was found in 21% cases. The Illumina whole-genome small-RNA profiling by next-generation sequencing was done on 22 samples and revealed 7 specific miRNAs to HPV+ OSCC, 77 to HPV+ OPSCC, and additional 3 shared with both; 51 miRNAs were specific to HPV− OPSCC, 62 to HPV− OSCC, and 31 shared with both. The results for 9 miRNAs (miR-9, -21, -29a, -100, -106b, -143 and -145) were assessed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction on the whole study population. The data was additionally confirmed by reanalyzing publicly available miRNA sequencing Cancer Genome Atlas consortium (TCGA) HNSCC data. Cell signaling pathway analysis revealed differences between HPV+ and HPV− HNSCC. Our findings compared with literature data revealed extensive heterogeneity of miRNA deregulation with only several miRNAs consistently affected, and miR-9 being the most likely HPV related miRNA. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Resistance to 5-Fluorouracil chemotherapy is a major cause of therapeutic failure in colon cancer cure. Development of combined therapies constitutes an effective strategy to inhibit cancer cells and prevent the emergence of drug resistance. For this purpose, we investigated the anti-tumoral effect of thirteen phenolic compounds, from the Tunisian quince Cydonia oblonga Miller, alone or combined to 5-FU, on the human 5-FU-resistant LS174-R colon cancer cells in comparison to parental cells. Our results showed that only Kaempferol was able to chemo-sensitize 5-FU-resistant LS174-R cells. This phenolic compound combined with 5-FU exerted synergistic inhibitory effect on cell viability. This combination enhanced the apoptosis and induced cell cycle arrest of both chemo-resistant and sensitive cells through impacting the expression levels of different cellular effectors. Kaempferol also blocked the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and modulated the expression of JAK/STAT3, MAPK, PI3K/AKT and NF-κB. In silico docking analysis suggested that the potent anti-tumoral effect of Kaempferol, compared to its two analogs (Kaempferol 3-O-glucoside and Kampferol 3-O-rutinoside), can be explained by the absence of glucosyl groups. Overall, our data propose Kaempferol as a potential chemotherapeutic agent to be used alone or in combination with 5-FU to overcome colon cancer drug resistance. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Considering the high prevalence and mortality rate of colorectal cancer, in this study we tried to design and validate a standard printed form and evaluate oncologists’ and nurses’ adherence to this form. This cross-sectional study was performed in Omid hospital, Mashhad, Iran from January 2015 to October 2015. A Chemotherapy form including various demographic and clinical parameters and approved chemotherapy regimens for colorectal cancer was designed by the clinical pharmacist and validated by clinical oncologists working in this center. All eligible patients admitted in this center during this period of time were included in the study. Adherence of the oncologists and nurses to this form and probable medication errors were identified by the pharmacy student. Sixty-seven patients with colorectal cancer and a total of 251 chemotherapy courses were evaluated. All patients received regimens compatible with developed form but in 206 courses (98.56%) of chemotherapy dosing error happened and in most of cases patients received lower than calculated dose (37.8%). Three errors occurred in administration step by nurses which they infused the medication in shorter than recommended duration. In general, oncologists’ adherence with developed form for chemotherapy of colorectal cancer was relatively high, except in dose calculation. Avoiding from rounding the calculated medications’ doses and precise calculation of patients’ body surface area can prevent most of medication errors and reduce risk of adverse drug reaction occurrence. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

Nevertheless, the importance of transfusion timing is still unclear. The primary purpose of this study is to appraise whether the receipt of intraoperative blood transfusion (BT) differ from postoperative BT in regards to cancer outcomes in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients treated with nephrectomy. Data on 1168 patients with RCC, who underwent radical or partial nephrectomy as primary therapy between 1988–2013 were analyzed. PBT was defined as transfusion of allogeneic red blood cells (RBC) during surgery or the postsurgical period. Survival was analyzed and compared using the Kaplan–Meier method with the log-rank test. Of 1168 patients, 198 patients (16.9%) received a PBT. Including 117 intraoperative BT and 81 postoperative BT. Only 21 (10.6%) patients required both intraoperative and postoperative BT. On multivariate analyses, receipt of PBT was associated with significantly worse local disease recurrence (HR: 2.4; P = 0.017), metastatic progression (HR: 2.7; P = 0.005), cancer-specific mortality (HR: 3.5; P = 0.002) and all-cause mortality (HR: 2.1; P = 0.005). Nevertheless, postoperative BT was not independently associated with increased risk of local recurrence (p = 0.1), metastatic progression (P = 0.16) or kidney cancer death (P = 0.63), yet did significantly increase the risk of overall mortality (HR: 2.6; P = 0.004). In the current study, intraoperative transfusion of allogeneic RBC is associated with increased risks of cancer recurrence and mortality following nephrectomy. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

For this reason novel therapies accounting for PDAC peculiarities, such as the relevant stromal reaction, are urgently needed. Here adipose mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (AD-MSC) have been armed to constantly release a soluble trimeric and multimeric variant of the known anti-cancer TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (sTRAIL). This cancer gene therapy strategy was in vitro challenged demonstrating that sTRAIL was thermally stable and able to induce apoptosis in the PDAC lines BxPC-3, MIA PaCa-2 and against primary PDAC cells. sTRAIL released by AD-MSC relocated into the tumor stroma was able to significantly counteract tumor growth in vivo with a significant reduction in tumor size, in cytokeratin-7+ cells and by an anti-angiogenic effect. In parallel, histology on PDAC specimens form patients (n = 19) was performed to investigate the levels of TRAIL DR4, DR5 and OPG receptors generating promising insights on the possible clinical translation of our approach. These results indicate that adipose MSC can very efficiently vehicle a novel TRAIL variant opening unexplored opportunities for PDAC treatment. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Therefore, identification of novel therapeutic targets involved in melanoma progression is urgently needed for developing effective therapeutic methods. Overexpression of interleukin-13 receptor α2 (IL13Rα2) is observed in several cancer types including glioma and pancreatic cancer. Although IL13Rα2 is implicated in the progression of various types of cancer, its expression and roles in the malignant melanoma have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we showed that IL13Rα2 was expressed in approximately 7.5% melanoma patients. While IL13Rα2 expression in human melanoma cells decreased their proliferation in vitro, it promoted in vivo tumour growth and angiogenesis in melanoma xenograft mouse model. We also found that the expression of amphiregulin, a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, was correlated with IL13Rα2 expression in cultured melanoma cells, xenograft tumour tissues and melanoma clinical samples. Furthermore, expression of amphiregulin promoted tumour growth, implicating causal relationship between the expression of IL13Rα2 and amphiregulin. These results suggest that IL13Rα2 enhances tumorigenicity by inducing angiogenesis in malignant melanoma, and serves as a potential therapeutic target of malignant melanoma. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Experiment in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines demonstrated up-regulation of PKD2 led to high expression of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vim, mmp9 et al.) and EMT transcription factors(zeb1, twist, snail), and the results were reversed when PKD2 was knocked down. Further investigation showed that abrogation of PKD2 inhibited A549 cell migration, invasion, proliferation and induced cell arrest in G2/M phase.

We showed for the first time that Raman imaging can be used to distinguish successfully between glycosylated and nonglycosylated proteins in normal and cancer tissue. Thousands of protein, lipid and glycan species exist in cells and tissues and their metabolism is monitored via numerous pathways, networks and methods. The metabolism can change in response to cellular environment alterations, such as development of a disease. Measuring such alterations and understanding the pathways involved are crucial to fully understand cellular metabolism in cancer development. In this paper Raman markers of glycogen, glycosaminoglycan, chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate proteoglycan were identified based on their vibrational signatures. High spatial resolution of Raman imaging combined with chemometrics allows separation of individual species from many chemical components present in each cell. We have found that metabolism of proteins, lipids and glycans is markedly deregulated in breast (adenocarcinoma) and brain (medulloblastoma) tumors. We have identified two glycoforms in the normal breast tissue and the malignant brain tissue in contrast to the breast cancer tissue where only one glycoform has been identified. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate anti-cancer effects of NLC-Citral in MDA MB-231 cells in vitro through the Annexin V, cell cycle, JC-1 and fluorometric assays. Additionally, this study is aimed to effects of NLC-Citral in reducing the tumor weight and size in 4T1 induced murine breast cancer model. Results showed that NLC-Citral induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest in MDA MB-231 cells. Furthermore, a prominent anti-metastatic ability of NLC-Citral was demonstrated in vitro using scratch, migration and invasion assays. A significant reduction of migrated and invaded cells was observed in the NLC-Citral treated MDA MB-231 cells. To further evaluate the apoptotic and anti-metastatic mechanism of NLC-Citral at the molecular level, microarray-based gene expression and proteomic profiling were conducted. Based on the result obtained, NLC-Citral was found to regulate several important signaling pathways related to cancer development such as apoptosis, cell cycle, and metastasis signaling pathways. Additionally, gene expression analysis was validated through the targeted RNA sequencing and real-time polymerase chain reaction. In conclusion, the NLC-Citral inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells in vitro, majorly through the induction of apoptosis, anti-metastasis, anti-angiogenesis potentials, and reducing the tumor weight and size without altering the therapeutic effects of citral. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The incidence of developing cancer should increase with the body mass, yet is not the case, a conundrum referred to as Peto’s paradox. Elephants have a lower incidence of cancer suggesting that these animals have probably evolved different ways to protect themselves against the disease. The paradox is worth revisiting with the realization that most mammals encode an endogenous APOBEC3 cytidine deaminase capable of mutating single stranded DNA. Indeed, the mutagenic activity of some APOBEC3 enzymes has been shown to introduce somatic mutations into genomic DNA. These enzymes are now recognized as causal agent responsible for the accumulation of CG- > TA transitions and DNA breaks leading to chromosomal rearrangements in human cancer genomes. Here, we identified an elephant A3Z1 gene, related to human APOBEC3A and showed that it could efficiently deaminate cytidine, 5-methylcytidine and produce DNA breaks leading to massive apoptosis, similar to other mammalian APOBEC3A enzymes where body mass varies by up to four orders of magnitude. Consequently, it could be considered that eAZ1 might contribute to cancer in elephants in a manner similar to their proposed role in humans. If so, eAZ1 might be particularly well regulated to counter Peto’s paradox. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Despite recent improvements in treatment, ovarian cancer is still the leading cause of death from gynaecological malignancies. Today, marine mollusks are considered as natural source of new biologically and pharmacologically active compounds by scientists and the pharmaceutical industries. The aim of this study is to investigate the selective apoptotic effects of Turbo coronatus crude extract fractions on human epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells and mitochondria. The cells and mitochondria were isolated from cancerous and non-cancerous ovarian tissues and exposed to IC 50 concentration of F1 fraction for evaluation of mitochondrial and cellular parameters. Our results showed that F1 fraction of T. coronatus crude extract significantly induced toxic effects only in the cancerous ovarian mitochondria, including increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, mitochondrial swelling, and cytochrome c release.Flow-cytometry analysis demonstrated that F1 fraction of T. coronatus progressively induced apoptosis and necrosis only on EOC but not non-cancerous cells. We eventuallyconcluded that F1 fraction of T. coronatus crude extract selectively induces apoptosis in EOC through a ROS-mediated pathway. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

        fabio:abstract     "Artemisinin is used as an antimalarial and anticancer agent with minimal toxic effects on the host body. Biotin-PEG-PCL polymers have been used for targeted drug delivery to cancer, as well as to improve the pharmacokinetics of the drug and reduce its effects. In this study, biotin-conjugated copolymers were fabricated with polymerization of the ring opening method and the properties of copolymer and nanoparticles were investigated using various techniques. The toxicity of artemisinin and its nanoparticles have been investigated on MCF-7 and normal HFF2 cells. The results showed that the encapsulation efficacy of artemisinin in nanoparticles was 45.5 ± 0.41%. The release profile of the drug indicates that the release is slow and controlled and is approximately pH dependent. The results of artemisinin cell culture on human breast cancer cells showed that biotin-PEG-PCL nanoparticles had an inhibitory effect on MCF-7 cells and had no toxic effects on HFF2 cells. Anticancer activity in vivo in the 4T1 breast cancer model showed that tumour volumes were decreased up 40 mm3 by ART-loaded micelles and 76 mm3 by free ART, compared to the control group (2150 mm). In vivo results showed that this formulation significantly increases the accumulation of substances in the tumours. Therefore, the molecular formulation of ART-based copolymers can be a desirable process for cancer treatment purposes. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group." ;

It has been estimated that there are about 2 billion people with a serological profile of HBV infection, and 360 million patients worldwide living with chronic HBV-associated liver disease, hence the need to find an efficient and precise diagnosis technique to drive a robust treatment for Hepatitis B virus cannot be over emphasized. The emergence of analytical device like biosensor which combines biological and physicochemical element to detect HBV in screened samples has been very helpful in providing a timely intervention to tame this virus.

        fabio:abstract    "n-Butylidenephthalide (BP) is a potential anti-cancer drug, which can be extracted from Angelica sinensis (Danggui). Previous reports have shown the effectiveness of BP in treating cancer diseases. However, BP has no targeting capacity towards specific cancer cells. To improve treatment efficiency and reduce the dose of BP used in cancer treatment, targeting-based approaches should be developed. In the present study, we used riboflavin-5′-phosphate (RFMP) immobilized iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4 MNPs) as carriers for BP to treat cancer cell lines derived from liver, prostate and breast. These model cancer cells overexpress riboflavin receptors on their cell membrane and are also sensitive to BP treatment. Thus, BP-binding free RFMP on MNPs can be used as probes to target these model cells, whereas BP can be readily released on target cancer cells. Cell viability was twofold lower by using Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs immobilized with BP than that achieved by using free-form BP at a similar amount. Moreover, BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs have no apparent harmful effects on non-target cells. In addition, we evaluated the level of cysteine-aspartic acid protease 3 (caspase 3) in the resultant cell lysate obtained after treatment by BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs to demonstrate that apoptosis is mainly involved in the growth inhibition of target cells. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

The aim of this national population-based retrospective study was to analyze the relationship between MetS and the incidence of laryngeal cancer. Patients with laryngeal cancer (ICD-10: C32) between 2009 and 2010 were retrospectively identified and tracked until 2015 using the Korean Health Insurance claims database. During the seven-year follow-up period, 5,322 subjects were newly diagnosed with larynx cancer. The mean age of people with laryngeal cancer was much higher than those without (63.29 vs. 47.7 years, p < 0.0001), and the incidence of larynx cancer in men was much higher than that in women (93.16% vs. 6.84%, p < 0.0001). Age, gender, smoking status, alcohol intake, and exercise-adjusted hazard ratios indicated that participants with MetS had a 1.13-fold higher hazard of having larynx cancer than those without MetS. The number of MetS components was a strong risk factor for laryngeal cancer with a higher risk estimate of this cancer in both ex- and current smokers as well as people who have never smoked. MetS was found to be an independent risk factor for the incidence of laryngeal cancer. In Korea, MetS and its components are significantly associated with the development of laryngeal cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

In this study, we demonstrated that FLOT2 expression levels were greatly upregulated in glioma tissues and cell lines, and the FLOT2 expression in glioma tissue was markedly associated with tumour stage and size. Overexpression of FLOT2 was correlated with poor prognosis of glioma patients. The functional assay revealed that silenced FLOT2 repressed the viability, migration, and invasion of glioma cells. And then, we detected the relationship between miR-449 and FLOT2. Luciferase reporter assay and Western blot results showed that miR-449 directly binding the 3′UTR sequence of FLOT2 and regulated FLOT2 expression in glioma cells. Finally, we detected the expression levels of miR-449 in glioma tissue and cell lines and found that miR-449 was significantly downregulated in glioma tissues and cell lines. In conclusion, we demonstrated that overexpression FLOT2 was associated with poor prognosis of glioma patients and involved in the progression of glioma, identifying a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for glioma progression. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group." ;

One of the consequences of chromosomal rearrangement is gene fusions in the cancer genome. We have previously identified a panel of fusion genes in aggressive prostate cancers. In this study, we showed that 6 of these fusion genes are present in 7 different types of human malignancies with variable frequencies. Among them, the CCNH-C5orf30 and TRMT11-GRIK2 gene fusions were found in breast cancer, colon cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, ovarian cancer and liver cancer, with frequencies ranging from 12.9% to 85%. In contrast, four other gene fusions (mTOR-TP53BP1, TMEM135-CCDC67, KDM4-AC011523.2 and LRRC59-FLJ60017) are less frequent. Both TRMT11-GRIK2 and CCNH-C5orf30 are also frequently present in lymph node metastatic cancer samples from the breast, colon and ovary. Thus, detecting these fusion transcripts may have significant biological and clinical implications in cancer patient management. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Quantifying the genetic correlation between cancers can provide important insights into the mechanisms driving cancer etiology. Using genome-wide association study summary statistics across six cancer types based on a total of 296,215 cases and 301,319 controls of European ancestry, here we estimate the pair-wise genetic correlations between breast, colorectal, head/neck, lung, ovary and prostate cancer, and between cancers and 38 other diseases. We observed statistically significant genetic correlations between lung and head/neck cancer (r g = 0.57, p = 4.6 × 10 −8 ), breast and ovarian cancer (r g = 0.24, p = 7 × 10 −5 ), breast and lung cancer (r g = 0.18, p =1.5 × 10 −6 ) and breast and colorectal cancer (r g = 0.15, p = 1.1 × 10 −4 ). We also found that multiple cancers are genetically correlated with non-cancer traits including smoking, psychiatric diseases and metabolic characteristics. Functional enrichment analysis revealed a significant excess contribution of conserved and regulatory regions to cancer heritability. Our comprehensive analysis of cross-cancer heritability suggests that solid tumors arising across tissues share in part a common germline genetic basis. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Purpose: Several previous studies have shown that oral bisphosphonates (BPs) are associated with the incidence of 13 specific cancers, including lung cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the findings are heterogeneous. Methods and results: Relevant studies published in databases such as PubMed, Embase database, and Cochrane library were systematically retrieved from inception to August 25th, 2018, regardless of language, by two investigators independently. Afterwards, the maximum adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted from the retrieved studies. Finally, 13 cohort studies involving 1,510,763 participants were enrolled into this meta-analysis. No significant relationship was found between oral BPs and the risk of all-cause cancer in osteoporosis (OP) patients among the entire population (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80–1.18; I 2 92.5%). Besides, oral BPs could remarkably reduce the incidence of breast cancer (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68–0.92; I 2 54%) and endometrial cancer (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64–0.96; I 2 0%) in postmenopausal OP females. In addition, oral BPs were also found to evidently reduce the incidence of upper gastrointestinal cancer in OP patients among the entire population (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54–0.98; I 2 36.1%). However, oral BPs may lead to increased risk of liver cancer in mixed genders (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.03–2.77; I 2 30.7%). Conclusions: Taken together, oral BPs do not increase the risk of incidence of all-cause cancer; instead, they can reduce the incidence of breast, endometrial, and upper gastrointestinal cancers among the postmenopausal OP females. Our analysis stratified by gender suggests that oral BPs may increase the incidence of liver cancer in mixed genders, while no significant association was observed in females. Careful analysis of post-marketing data should be conducted to address the clinical relevance of our results on the putative association of oral BP use and liver cancer suggested by our meta-analysis. © 2018, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play critical roles in the tumor progression. However, it remains unclear how cancer cells migrate in the three-dimensional (3D) matrix of cancer tissues and how CAFs support the cancer invasion. Here we propose a novel mechanism of fibroblast-dependent cancer cell invasion in the 3D collagen matrix. Human cancer cell lines from the pancreas (Panc-1), lung (A549) and some other organs actively adhered to normal fibroblasts and primary lung CAFs in cultures. To show its significance in tumor invasion, we designed a new invasion assay in which homogeneous microspheroids consisting of cancer cells and fibroblasts were embedded into collagen gel. Time-lapse experiments showed that cancer cells adhered to and quickly migrated on the long protrusions of fibroblasts in the 3D collagen matrix. Fibroblast-free cancer cells poorly invaded the matrix. Experiments with function-blocking antibodies, siRNAs, and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that cancer cells adhered to fibroblasts through integrin α5β1-mediated binding to fibronectin on the surface of fibroblasts. Immunochemical analyses of the co-cultures and lung cancers suggested that cancer cells could acquire the migratory force by the fibronectin/integrin signaling. Our results also revealed that the fibroblast-bound fibronectin was a preferential substrate for cancer cells to migrate in the collagen matrix. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The prognosis of pancreatic cancer remains dismal despite continuous and considerable efforts. Integrins (ITGs) are highly expressed in various malignant cancers. However, very few studies investigated the role of integrin α3 (ITGα3) in malignant cancers. Here, we determined the functional role of ITGα3 in pancreatic cancer. Analysis of public microarray databases and Western blot analysis indicated a unique expression of ITGα3 in human pancreatic cancer. Silencing ITGα3 expression significantly inhibited the viability and migration of human pancreatic cancer cells. Notably, ablation of ITGα3 expression resulted in a significant decrease of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression compared with transfection of control-siRNA through an increased number of leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domain protein 1 (LRIG1) expression. In addition, ablating ITGα3 inhibited tumour growth via blockade of EGFR signalling in vivo. Furthermore, the highly expressed ITGα3 led to a poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. Our results provide novel insights into ITGα3-induced aggressive pancreatic cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Breast cancer metastasis accounts for most of the deaths from breast cancer. Since epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in promoting metastasis of cancer, many mechanisms regarding EMT have been studied. We previously showed that Ribonucleic acid export 1 (RAE1) is dysregulated in breast cancer and its overexpression leads to aggressive breast cancer phenotypes by inducing EMT. Here, we evaluated the functional capacity of RAE1 in breast cancer metastasis by using a three-dimensional (3D) culture system and xenograft models. Furthermore, to investigate the mechanisms of RAE1-driven EMT, in vitro studies were carried out. The induction of EMT with RAE1-overexpression was confirmed under the 3D culture system and in vivo system. Importantly, RAE1 mediates upregulation of an EMT marker ZEB1, by binding to the promoter region of ZEB1. Knockdown of ZEB1 in RAE1-overexpressing cells suppressed invasive and migratory behaviors, accompanied by an increase in epithelial and a decrease in mesenchymal markers. Taken together, these data demonstrate that RAE1 contributes to breast cancer metastasis by regulating a key EMT-inducing factor ZEB1 expression, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Obesity is a risk factor for many cancers including breast, esophageal, colon, and thyroid cancer. We aimed to evaluate the association of thyroid cancer with body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and weight change. This nationwide population-based cohort study included 11,323,006 adults who joined the national health screening program. Weight change was defined as the difference between the weight of the subjects measured during the study period and the weight at the time of four years ago. For evaluating the association between the weight change and the risk of thyroid cancer, subjects without weight change for four years were defined as the reference group. Mean age was 50.1 ± 13.7 years and 44% were female. In total, 50,464 subjects (0.4%) had newly-diagnosed thyroid cancer. After multivariable analyses, the incidence of thyroid cancer increased significantly in subjects with larger WC as well as higher BMI (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). In subjects who were lean and became obese, the incidence of thyroid cancers increased significantly (hazard ratio [HR] 1.15 [1.11–1.19]). In subjects who were obese and became lean, the incidence of thyroid cancers decreased significantly (HR 0.89 [0.86–0.93]). These results demonstrated that higher BMI and larger WC were significantly associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer. Weight gain in lean subjects was associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer, and weight reduction in subjects with obesity was associated with a decreased risk of thyroid cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) has increased among Norwegian women, and is among the highest in the world. In order to understand this increase, country specific dietary exposures have been investigated. The aim of this study was to quantify the association between consumption of brown cheese, a common bread topping in Norway, and colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer in the prospective Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) Study. Data on brown cheese consumption and adjustment factors was available for 82 527 women. During a mean of 14.6 years of follow-up (1.2 million person-years), there were 1360 cases of colorectal cancer (907 colon; 453 rectal). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer sites. We modelled restricted cubic splines with 4 knots, to assess a possible non-linear relationship between brown cheese intake and the investigated cancer sites. In the age-adjusted model, consumption of more than 2 slices (>16 grams) of brown cheese per day was associated with 13% reduced risk of colon cancer (95% CI 4%-21%) compared to women who did not consume brown cheese. The multivariable-adjusted model, however, showed no association between brown cheese consumption and the risk of colorectal, colon, or rectal cancer (colorectal: HR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.76–1.13, p-trend 0.37; colon: HR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.65–1.06; p-trend = 0.10; rectal: HR = 1.16, 95% CI 0.84–1.1.61, p-trend = 0.41). In this large, prospective cohort study of women, consumption of brown cheese was suggestively protective against colon cancer. However, adjustment attenuated the inverse risk association. Brown cheese consumption was not associated with rectal cancer, or colorectal cancer overall. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Current cancer diagnosis utilizes histopathology, which requires tissue acquisition, extensive processing and, in most cases, relies on the qualitative morphological analysis of tissues and cells. Molecular biomarkers are only available for a few specific tumor subtypes. We discovered that the fluorescence polarization (Fpol) of Methylene Blue (MB) is significantly higher in cancer than in normal human breast tissues and cells. We confirmed that fluorescence polarization imaging did not affect the viability of the cells and yielded highly significant differences between cancer and normal cells using MB concentrations as low as 0.05 and 0.01 mg/ml. To explain this phenomenon we examined intracellular localization of MB and its fluorescence lifetime. We determined that higher fluorescence polarization of MB occurs due to its increased accumulation in mitochondria of cancer cells, as well as shorter fluorescence lifetime in cancer relative to normal cells. As quantitative MB Fpol imaging can be performed in vivo and in real time, it holds the potential to provide an accurate quantitative marker of cancer at the cellular level. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

However, the specific combinations of mutations responsible for the vast majority of cancers have not been identified. Current computational approaches focus on identifying driver genes and mutations. Although individually these mutations can increase the risk of cancer they do not result in cancer without additional mutations. We present a fundamentally different approach for identifying the cause of individual instances of cancer: we search for combinations of genes with carcinogenic mutations (multi-hit combinations) instead of individual driver genes or mutations. We developed an algorithm that identified a set of multi-hit combinations that differentiate between tumor and normal tissue samples with 91% sensitivity (95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 89–92%) and 93% specificity (95% CI = 91–94%) on average for seventeen cancer types. We then present an approach based on mutational profile that can be used to distinguish between driver and passenger mutations within these genes. These combinations, with experimental validation, can aid in better diagnosis, provide insights into the etiology of cancer, and provide a rational basis for designing targeted combination therapies. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

We developed a novel computational platform applying a multi-modal approach to filter out passengers and more robustly identify putative driver genes. The primary filter identifies enrichment of cancer mutations in CATH functional families (CATH-FunFams) – structurally and functionally coherent sets of evolutionary related domains. Using structural representatives from CATH-FunFams, we subsequently seek enrichment of mutations in 3D and show that these mutation clusters have a very significant tendency to lie close to known functional sites or conserved sites predicted using CATH-FunFams. Our third filter identifies enrichment of putative driver genes in functionally coherent protein network modules confirmed by literature analysis to be cancer associated. Our approach is complementary to other domain enrichment approaches exploiting Pfam families, but benefits from more functionally coherent groupings of domains. Using a set of mutations from 22 cancers we detect 151 putative cancer drivers, of which 79 are not listed in cancer resources and include recently validated cancer associated genes EPHA7, DCC netrin-1 receptor and zinc-finger protein ZNF479. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Collectively, 86.3% (63/73) of HAMPs have recurrent alterations in at least 1 cancer type and 16 HAMPs, including 9 understudied HAMPs, are identified as putative therapeutic targets across multiple cancer types. For example, the recurrent focal amplification of BRD9 is observed in 9 cancer types and genetic depletion of BRD9 inhibits tumor growth.

        fabio:abstract    "The current system for evaluating prostate cancer architecture is the Gleason grading system which divides the morphology of cancer into five distinct architectural patterns, labeled 1 to 5 in increasing levels of cancer aggressiveness, and generates a score by summing the labels of the two most dominant patterns. The Gleason score is currently the most powerful prognostic predictor of patient outcomes; however, it suffers from problems in reproducibility and consistency due to the high intra-observer and inter-observer variability amongst pathologists. In addition, the Gleason system lacks the granularity to address potentially prognostic architectural features beyond Gleason patterns. We evaluate prostate cancer for architectural subtypes using techniques from topological data analysis applied to prostate cancer glandular architecture. In this work we demonstrate the use of persistent homology to capture architectural features independently of Gleason patterns. Specifically, using persistent homology, we compute topological representations of purely graded prostate cancer histopathology images of Gleason patterns 3,4 and 5, and show that persistent homology is capable of clustering prostate cancer histology into architectural groups through a ranked persistence vector. Our results indicate the ability of persistent homology to cluster prostate cancer histopathology images into unique groups with dominant architectural patterns consistent with the continuum of Gleason patterns. In addition, of particular interest, is the sensitivity of persistent homology to identify specific sub-architectural groups within single Gleason patterns, suggesting that persistent homology could represent a robust quantification method for prostate cancer architecture with higher granularity than the existing semi-quantitative measures. The capability of these topological representations to segregate prostate cancer by architecture makes them an ideal candidate for use as inputs to future machine learning approaches with the intent of augmenting traditional approaches with topological features for improved diagnosis and prognosis. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Among 8,651,569 cancer patients, 13,311 committed suicide; the rate of suicide was 28.58/ 100,000-person years, and the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of suicide was 4.44 (95% CI, 4.33, 4.55). The predominant patients who committed suicide were male (83%) and white (92%). Cancers of the lung, head and neck, testes, bladder, and Hodgkin lymphoma had the highest SMRs (> 5-10) through the follow up period. Elderly, white, unmarried males with localized disease are at highest risk vs other cancer patients. Among those diagnosed at < 50 years of age, the plurality of suicides is from hematologic and testicular tumors; if > 50, from prostate, lung, and colorectal cancer patients. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

However, the specific combinations of mutations responsible for the vast majority of cancers have not been identified. Current computational approaches focus on identifying driver genes and mutations. Although individually these mutations can increase the risk of cancer they do not result in cancer without additional mutations. We present a fundamentally different approach for identifying the cause of individual instances of cancer: we search for combinations of genes with carcinogenic mutations (multi-hit combinations) instead of individual driver genes or mutations. We developed an algorithm that identified a set of multi-hit combinations that differentiate between tumor and normal tissue samples with 91% sensitivity (95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 89–92%) and 93% specificity (95% CI = 91–94%) on average for seventeen cancer types. We then present an approach based on mutational profile that can be used to distinguish between driver and passenger mutations within these genes. These combinations, with experimental validation, can aid in better diagnosis, provide insights into the etiology of cancer, and provide a rational basis for designing targeted combination therapies. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The UHRF1-DNMT1 axis plays a key role in DNA maintenance methylation in mammals. Accumulative studies demonstrate that UHRF1 is broadly overexpressed in cancers, which contributes to cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Interestingly, a proteasome-dependent downregulation of UHRF1 has been observed in pluripotent ground state mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) cultured in the presence of two kinase (MEK1/MEK2 and GSK3β) inhibitors (termed 2i), raising the question whether UHRF1 is similarly regulated in cancer cells. Here we present evidence that while addition of 2i broadly downregulates UHRF1 and DNMT1 in various cancer cells, distinct underlying mechanisms are involved. In contrast to mESCs, 2i-induced downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in cancer cells cannot be rescued by proteasome inhibitor and occurs primarily at the level of transcription. Furthermore, downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 by 2i is due to inhibition of MEK1/MEK2, but not GSK3β activity. Data mining reveals a marked co-expression of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in normal tissues as well as cancers. We provide evidence that multiple transcription factors including E2F1 and SP1 mediate the transcriptional activation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 by the activated MEK/ERK pathway. Together our study reveals distinct regulation of UHRF1/DNMT1 in mESCs and cancer cells and identifies activated MEK/ERK pathway as a driving force for coordinated and aberrant over-expression of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in cancers. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

When it is applied to cancer cells, solid stress hinders their proliferation rate and promotes cancer cell invasion and metastatic potential. However, the underlying mechanisms of how it is implicated in cancer metastasis is not yet fully understood. Here, we used two pancreatic cancer cell lines and an established in vitro system to study the effect of solid stress-induced signal transduction on pancreatic cancer cell migration as well as the mechanism involved. Our results show that the migratory ability of cells increases as a direct response to solid stress. We also found that Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) expression and secretion is strongly upregulated in pancreatic cancer cells in response to mechanical compression. Performing a phosphoprotein screening, we identified that solid stress activates the Akt/CREB1 pathway to transcriptionally regulate GDF15 expression, which eventually promotes pancreatic cancer cell migration. Our results suggest a novel solid stress signal transduction mechanism bringing GDF15 to the centre of pancreatic tumor biology and rendering it a potential target for future anti-metastatic therapeutic innovations. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a cancer treatment that make use of the cancer-specific accumulation of porphyrins. We have reported that mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mitROS) upregulate uptake transporter of porphyrins, heme carrier protein-1 (HCP-1). The accumulation of cancer-specific porphyrins was increased by mitROS production, thereby the cancer-specific PDT cytotoxicity was enhanced. Thus we investigated whether mitROS production by hyperthermia can enhanced the cytotoxicity of PDT or not. In this study, 1 h of hyperthermia at 42 °C increased the mitROS production, and both the accumulation of cancer-specific porphyrins and the PDT cytotoxicity increased. Moreover, the authors treated cells with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) to examine the effect of mitROS. NAC inhibited the increasing ROS production after hyperthermia to restrain the post-treatment increase of cancer-specific porphyrins accumulation. Moreover, the increase of ROS production in cancer cells after hyperthermia upregulated HCP-1 expression and downregulated ABCG2 expression. These regulation were inhibited by NAC. These results suggest that hyperthermia treatment increased mitROS production, which involved HpD accumulation and enhanced PDT effects in cancer cells. The mechanism of this phenomenon was most likely to be due to both the upregulation of HCP-1 and the downregulation of ABCG2 by mitROS. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

In this study, we assessed the relationship between breast cancer and cadaverine biosynthesis. Cadaverine treatment of Balb/c female mice (500 nmol/kg p.o. q.d.) grafted with 4T1 breast cancer cells ameliorated the disease (lower mass and infiltration of the primary tumor, fewer metastases, and lower grade tumors). Cadaverine treatment of breast cancer cell lines corresponding to its serum reference range (100–800 nM) reverted endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, inhibited cellular movement and invasion, moreover, rendered cells less stem cell-like through reducing mitochondrial oxidation. Trace amino acid receptors (TAARs), namely, TAAR1, TAAR8 and TAAR9 were instrumental in provoking the cadaverine-evoked effects. Early stage breast cancer patients, versus control women, had reduced abundance of the CadA and LdcC genes in fecal DNA, both responsible for bacterial cadaverine production. Moreover, we found low protein expression of E. coli LdcC in the feces of stage 1 breast cancer patients. In addition, higher expression of lysine decarboxylase resulted in a prolonged survival among early-stage breast cancer patients. Taken together, cadaverine production seems to be a regulator of early breast cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Exogenous overexpression of CBX6 inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation, and induced cell cycle arrest along with suppression of migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro. Microarray analyses revealed that CBX6 governs a complex gene expression program. Moreover, CBX6 induced significant downregulation of bone marrow stromal cell antigen-2 (BST2), a potential therapeutic target, via interactions with its promoter region.

        fabio:abstract    "MRI plays important roles in endometrial and cervical cancer assessment, from detection to recurrent disease evaluation. Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common malignant tumor of the female genital tract in Western countries. EC patients are divided into risk categories based on histopathological tumor type, grade, and myometrial invasion depth. EC is surgically staged using the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) system. Since FIGO (2009) stage correlates with prognosis, preoperative staging is essential for tailored treatment. MRI reveals myometrial invasion depth, which correlates with tumor grade and lymph node metastases, and thus correlates with prognosis. Cervical cancer (CC) is the second most common cancer, and the third leading cause of cancer-related death among females in developing countries. The FIGO Gynecologic Oncology Committee recently revised its CC staging guidelines, allowing staging based on imaging and pathological findings when available. The revised FIGO (2018) staging includes node involvement and thus enables both therapy selection and evaluation, prognosis estimation, and calculation of end results. MRI can accurately assess prognostic indicators, e.g., tumor size, parametrial invasion, pelvic sidewall, and lymph node invasion. Despite these important roles of MRI, radiologists still face challenges due to the technical and interpretation pitfalls of MRI during all phases of endometrial and cervical cancer evaluation. Awareness of mimics that can simulate both cancers is critical. With careful application, functional MRI with DWI and DCE sequences can help establish a correct diagnosis, although it is sometimes necessary to perform biopsy and histopathological analysis. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Our observations were confirmed in a large variety of solid and haematological malignancies. This test was able to detect dysplasia and carcinomas in situ lesions in different organs and circulating factors in cancer patients years after the removal of their lesions. To our knowledge, this ability is unique and not shared by other liquid biopsy platforms. Immunohistochemistry analysis of the xenotransplants revealed identical patterns of differentiation regardless of the cancer type, showing that differentiation through horizontal transfer might be dependent on the nature of the target cells rather than the type of cancer factors.

Various studies have shown the significance of identifying drug targets for cancer, although this process continues challenging in the field of anti-cancer drug designing. The primary purpose of this study is to design a novel approach to identify target genes for cancer. The sub-network of colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancers were constructed from human protein–protein interaction network. The potential genes were analyzed using hubs and centrality measures. For the identification of target genes, we retrieve those genes that had the highest score in both mutation rates and graph centrality. Moreover, gene deletion analysis revealed that MYC, TP53, and EGFR genes remained potential targets in colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancer respectively. Results suggest that combining network measures with mutation frequencies in cancer genes might assist in recognizing several potential drug targets. Future enhancement of this current approach is to combine these network properties with the biological insights from gene expression data, and their functions will provide a reliable method for rational drug designing. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature." ;

As extracellular matrix, glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) could bind its surface receptor adhesion molecule CD44 which is strongly expressed on breast cancer. We have previously reported a doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded HA-Lys-LA X-NPs (X-NP-DOX) NP delivery system for breast cancer treatment. In this study, we further investigated the antitumor effect of X-NP-DOX NP delivery system using low-dose DOX in both in vitro and in vivo systems. We demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX possessed the ability for inhibiting MCF-7 breast cancer cell growth, invasion, and migration, and inducing apoptosis in vitro. In in vivo experiments, injection of low-dose X-NP-DOX into tumor-bearing mouse resulted in significant reduction of tumor size. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining further revealed that low-dose X-NP-DOX induced higher percentage of apoptotic cells compared with free DOX or saline. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX inhibited Notch1 and Ras/MAPK pathways, decreased cancer stem cell population, and reduced tumorigenesis compared to free DOX in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Owing to its enhanced efficacy and higher targetability compared to free DOX, low-dose DOX delivered by NP system may be a promising novel strategy for breast cancer treatment." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Breast cancer survivors display altered inflammatory responses to immune challenges relative to cancer-naive controls likely due to previous cancer treatments, stress associated with cancer, and/or tumor physiology. Proper inflammatory responses are necessary for adaptive sickness behaviors (e.g., fatigue, anorexia, and fever) and neuroinflammatory pathways are also implicated in mental health disturbances (e.g., cognitive impairment, depression) suffered by cancer patients and survivors. Rodent cancer models indicate that tumors are sufficient to exacerbate neuroinflammatory responses after an immune challenge, however primary tumors are not usually present in cancer survivors, and the behavioral consequences of these brain changes remain understudied. Therefore, we tested the extent to which mammary tumor resection attenuates tumor-induced neuroinflammation and sickness behavior following an immune challenge (i.p. lipopolysaccharide [LPS] injection) in mice. Tnf-α, Il-1β, and Il-6 mRNA decreased in multiple brain regions of LPS-treated tumor-bearing mice relative to LPS-treated controls; tumor resection attenuated these effects in some cases (but not Tnf-α). Tumors also attenuated sickness behaviors (hypothermia and lethargy) compared to LPS-treated controls. Tumor resection reversed these behavioral consequences, although basal body temperature remained elevated, comparable to tumor-bearing mice. Thus, tumors significantly modulate neuroinflammatory pathways with functional consequences and tumor resection mitigates most, but not all, of these changes. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Although substantial advances have been obtained both in treatment and survival rates, there is still a need for new therapeutical approaches. Natural compounds are a realistic source of new bioactive compounds with anticancer activity. Among them, rosemary polyphenols have shown a vast antiproliferative capacity against colon cancer cells in vitro and in animal models. We have investigated the antitumor activity of a rosemary extract (RE) obtained by using supercritical fluid extraction through its capacity to inhibit various signatures of cancer progression and metastasis such as proliferation, migration, invasion and clonogenic survival. RE strongly inhibited proliferation, migration and colony formation of colon cancer cells regardless their phenotype. Treatment with RE led to a sharp increase of intracellular ROS that resulted in necrosis cell death. Nrf2 gene silencing increased RE cytotoxic effects, thus suggesting that this pathway was involved in cell survival. These in vitro results were in line with a reduction of tumor growth by oral administration of RE in a xenograft model of colon cancer cells using athymic nude mice. These findings indicate that targeting colon cancer cells by increasing intracellular ROS and decreasing cell survival mechanisms may suppose a therapeutic option in colon cancer through the combination of rosemary compounds and chemotherapeutic drugs. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Although cure rates are high for early stage disease, clinical outcomes for advanced, metastatic, or recurrent disease remain poor. To change this panorama, a deeper understanding of cervical cancer biology and novel study models are needed. Immortalized human cancer cell lines such as HeLa constitute crucial scientific tools, but there are few other cervical cancer cell lines available, limiting our understanding of a disease known for its molecular heterogeneity. This study aimed to establish novel cervical cancer cell lines derived from Brazilian patients. We successfully established one (HCB-514) out of 35 cervical tumors biopsied. We confirmed the phenotype of HCB-514 by verifying its’ epithelial and tumor origin through cytokeratins, EpCAM and p16 staining. It was also HPV-16 positive. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) showed relevant somatic mutations in several genes including BRCA2, TGFBR1 and IRX2. A copy number variation (CNV) analysis by nanostring and WES revealed amplification of genes mainly related to kinases proteins involved in proliferation, migration and cell differentiation, such as EGFR, PIK3CA, and MAPK7. Overexpression of EGFR was confirmed by phospho RTK-array and validated by western blot analysis. Furthermore, the HCB-514 cell line was sensitive to cisplatin. In summary, this novel Brazilian cervical cancer cell line exhibits relevant key molecular features and constitutes a new biological model for pre-clinical studies. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

To determine how cancer cells adapt to RS, we have monitored the expression of different components of the ATR-CHK1 pathway in primary tumor samples. We show that unlike upstream components of the pathway, the checkpoint mediators Claspin and Timeless are overexpressed in a coordinated manner. Remarkably, reducing the levels of Claspin and Timeless in HCT116 cells to pretumoral levels impeded fork progression without affecting checkpoint signaling. These data indicate that high level of Claspin and Timeless increase RS tolerance by protecting replication forks in cancer cells. Moreover, we report that primary fibroblasts adapt to oncogene-induced RS by spontaneously overexpressing Claspin and Timeless, independently of ATR signaling. Altogether, these data indicate that enhanced levels of Claspin and Timeless represent a gain of function that protects cancer cells from of oncogene-induced RS in a checkpoint-independent manner. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Curcumin, the active polyphenol from turmeric, helps to obstruct the growth of many types of cancers at various stages which include prostrate, melanoma, breast, brain tumor, pancreatic, leukemia, etc. The initiation and recurrence of cancer have been attributed to few mutated cells in bulk of tumor called as cancer stem cells which have the capacity of self-renewal and differentiation. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3B) is a multifunctional serine/threonine protein kinase, originally found in mammals, an important component of diverse signaling pathways, dysregulation of which leads to affect the cancer stem cell properties. The nutritional- and phytochemical-based dietary interventions may complement current chemotherapy to prevent recurrence and relapse of cancer. The objective of present study is to investigate the effect of retinoic acid and curcumin–retinoic acid conjugates against GSK-3B protein.

Endometrial cancers are associated with several critical gene mutations, including PIK3A, PTEN, and KRAS. Different gene mutations in endometrial cancer cells have varied responses to anticancer drugs and cancer therapies. The most frequently altered gene in endometrioid endometrial carcinoma tumors is PTEN. PTEN protein has lipid phosphatase and protein phosphatase activity, as well as other functions in the nucleus. Although the tumor-suppressive function of PTEN has mainly been attributed to its lipid phosphatase activity, a role for PTEN protein phosphatase activity in cell cycle regulation has also been suggested. Various tumor type-specific PTEN mutations are well documented. Here, nine endometrioid endometrial cancer cell lines with PIK3A, PTEN, and KRAS gene mutations were treated with docetaxel and radiation. One mutation with a docetaxel drug-resistant effect was a truncated form of PTEN. Among PTEN mutations in endometrial cancer cells, the Y68 frame shift mutation of PTEN constitutes a major mechanism of resistance to docetaxel treatment. The molecular mechanism involves truncation of the 403 amino acid PTEN protein at amino acid 68 by the Y68 frame shift, leading to the loss of PTEN protein phosphatase and lipid phosphatase activities. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

The present review comprehends the stimuli-responsive polymers and multi-responsiveness with respect to cancer therapy. It focuses on the exploitation of different stimuli like temperature, pH and enzymes responsiveness in a multi-stimuli setting. Nanogels and micelles being two of the most commonly used responsive polymeric carriers have also been discussed. The role of multiple stimuli delivery system is significant due to multiple changes happening in the near surroundings of cancer cells.

In contrast, antibodies to BLV were found in a very small percentage of healthy blood donors. There was no association between BLV DNA and other tumor prognostic biological markers such as hormonal receptors, HER2 oncoprotein, proliferation index, metastasis in sentinels lymph nodes, and tumor grade and size. Our findings suggest that BLV should be considered a potential predisposing factor to breast cancer in women. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Copy number loss of PIK3R1 (p85α) most commonly occurs in ovarian cancer among all cancer types. Here we report that ovarian cancer cells manifest a spectrum of tumorigenic phenotypes upon knockdown of PIK3R1. PIK3R1 loss activates AKT and p110-independent JAK2/STAT3 signaling through inducing changes in the phosphorylation of the docking protein Gab2, thereby relieving the negative inhibition on AKT and promoting the assembly of JAK2/STAT3 signalosome, respectively. Additional mechanisms leading to AKT activation include enhanced p110α kinase activity and a decrease in PTEN level. PIK3R1 loss renders ovarian cancer cells vulnerable to inhibition of AKT or JAK2/STAT3. The combination of AKT and STAT3 inhibitors significantly increases the anti-tumor effect compared to single-agent treatments. Together, our findings provide a rationale for mechanism-based therapeutic approach that targets tumors with loss of PIK3R1. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we perform Repli-Seq and integrated epigenome analyses and demonstrate that genomic regions that undergo long-range epigenetic deregulation in prostate cancer also show concordant differences in replication timing. A subset of altered replication timing domains are conserved across cancers from different tissue origins. Notably, late-replicating regions in cancer cells display a loss of DNA methylation, and a switch in heterochromatin features from H3K9me3-marked constitutive to H3K27me3-marked facultative heterochromatin. Finally, analysis of 214 prostate and 35 breast cancer genomes reveal that late-replicating regions are prone to cis and early-replication to trans chromosomal rearrangements. Together, our data suggests that the nature of chromosomal rearrangement in cancer is related to the spatial and temporal positioning and altered epigenetic states of early-replicating compared to late-replicating loci. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are promising therapies for haematological cancers. Historically, their therapeutic benefit is due to ADC targeting of lineage-restricted antigens. The C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is attractive for targeted therapy of haematological cancers, given its expression in multiple tumour types and role in cancer “homing” to bone marrow. However, CXCR4 is also expressed in haematopoietic cells and other normal tissues, raising safety challenges to the development of anti-CXCR4 ADCs for cancer treatment. Here, we designed the first anti-CXCR4 ADC with favourable therapeutic index, effective in xenografts of haematopoietic cancers resistant to standard of care and anti-CXCR4 antibodies. We screened multiple ADC configurations, by varying type of linker-payload, drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR), affinity and Fc format. The optimal ADC bears a non-cleavable linker, auristatin as payload at DAR = 4 and a low affinity antibody with effector–reduced Fc. Contrary to other drugs targeting CXCR4, anti-CXCR4 ADCs effectively eliminated cancer cells as monotherapy, while minimizing leucocytosis. The optimal ADC selectively eliminated CXCR4 + cancer cells in solid tumours, but showed limited toxicity to normal CXCR4 + tissues, sparing haematopoietic stem cells and progenitors. Our work provides proof-of-concept that through empirical ADC design, it is possible to target proteins with broad normal tissue expression. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Cancers in the bone produce a number of severe symptoms including pain that compromises patient functional status, quality of life, and survival. The source of this pain is multifaceted and includes factors secreted from tumor cells. Malignant cells release the neurotransmitter and cell-signaling molecule glutamate via the oxidative stress-related cystine/glutamate antiporter, system x C − , which reciprocally imports cystine for synthesis of glutathione and the cystine/cysteine redox cycle. Pharmacological inhibition of system x C − has shown success in reducing and delaying the onset of cancer pain-related behavior in mouse models. This investigation describes the development of a stable siRNA-induced knockdown of the functional trans-membrane system x C − subunit xCT (SLC7A11) in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Clones were verified for xCT knockdown at the transcript, protein, and functional levels. RNAseq was performed on a representative clone to comprehensively examine the transcriptional cellular signature in response to xCT knockdown, identifying multiple differentially regulated factors relevant to cancer pain including nerve growth factor, interleukin-1, and colony-stimulating factor-1. Mice were inoculated intrafemorally and recordings of pain-related behaviors including weight bearing, mechanical withdrawal, and limb use were performed. Animals implanted with xCT knockdown cancer cells displayed a delay until the onset of nociceptive behaviors relative to control cells. These results add to the body of evidence suggesting that a reduction in glutamate release from cancers in bone by inhibition of the system x C − transporter may decrease the severe and intractable pain associated with bone metastases. © The Author(s) 2018." ;

Method: For finding the related articles, the researchers searched several databases including PubMed &ProQuest and valid websites including ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Scientific Information Database, and Magiran. The key terms of \"reflexology, cancer, and chemotherapy\" individually and combined together were searched in Parisian and English, and the studies performed from 2009 to 2018 were extracted. Due to the lack of sufficient studies carried out into the outcome of reflexology on chemotherapy, both Persian and English articles were used. Results: A total of 57 studies were extracted from the databases and valid websites; five of which met the inclusion criteria. All selected studies were clinical trials. Implications for Practice: Reflexology can be used as a non-pharmacologic nursing intervention to alleviate the side effects of chemotherapy and improve the quality of life of cancer patients. © 2018 Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

For effective evaluation of this strategy it is crucial to identify which patients are suited for CD47-targeted therapy. In this respect, expression of the pro-phagocytic signal SLAMF7 on both macrophages and cancer cells was recently reported to be a requisite for CD47 antibody-mediated phagocytosis. Here, we demonstrate that in fact SLAMF7 expression on cancer cells is not required and does not impact on CD47 antibody therapy. Moreover, SLAMF7 also does not impact on phagocytosis induction by CD20 antibody rituximab nor associates with overall survival of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma patients. In contrast, expression of CD47 negatively impacts on overall and progression free survival. In conclusion, cancer cell expression of SLAMF7 is not required for phagocytosis and, in contrast to CD47 expression, should not be used as selection criterion for CD47-targeted therapy. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Increased Crabp2 levels have been found in various types of cancer, and are associated with poor patients’ survival. Although Crabp2 is found to be overexpressed in lung cancer, its role in metastasis of lung cancer is unclear. In this study, Crabp2 was overexpressed in high-metastatic C10F4 than low-metastatic lung cancer cells. Analysis of clinical samples revealed that high CRABP2 levels were correlated with lymph node metastases, poor overall survival, and increased recurrence. Knockdown of Crabp2 decreased migration, invasion, anoikis resistance, and in vivo metastasis. Crabp2 was co-immunoprecipitated with HuR, and overexpression of Crabp2 increased HuR levels, which promoted integrin β1/FAK/ERK signaling. Inhibition of HuR or integrin β1/FAK/ERK signaling reversed the promoting effect of Crabp2 in migration, invasion, and anoikis resistance. Knockdown of Crabp2 further inhibited the growth of cancer cells as compared with that by gemcitabine or irinotecan alone. The expression of Crabp2 in human lung tumors was correlated with stress marker CHOP. In conclusion, our findings have identified the promoting role of Crabp2 in anoikis resistance and metastasis. CRABP2 may serve as a prognostic marker and targeting CRABP2 may be exploited as a modality to reduce metastasis. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "SPG-56 is a newly isolated glycoprotein from sweet potatoes (Zhongshu NO. 1), but its value for suppressing breast cancer progression remains unknown. This study was designed to investigate the potential anti-cancer effects of SPG-56, which consists of 2.9% sugar and 97.1% protein. The effects of SPG-56 on the proliferation and apoptosis of breast cancer cells were determined using CCK-8 and Hoechst 33342 assays and flow cytometry, after staining with Annexin V and PI respectively. The activities of SPG-56 against breast cancer were examined using female BALB/c nude mice orthotopically implanted with human breast carcinoma cells of the types MCF-7 and 4T1-Luc. The cellular experiments showed that SPG-56 inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of MCF-7 cells dose- and time-dependently. Oral administration of SPG-56 significantly suppressed the development of MCF-7 tumor cells (P < 0.01) as compared with an untreated group. The serum tumor markers CEA, CA125 and CA153 in a 240 mg/kg/d SPG-56 decreased by 54.8%, 91.8%, and 90.3%, respectively. The experiments further demonstrated that SPG-56 inhibited the metastasis of breast cancer in MCF-7 and 4T1-bearing mice by altering the expression of MMP2, MMP9, VEGF, Occludin and Claudin. It is concluded that SPG-56 may have potential as a novel anti-tumor candidate for breast cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Lymph node metastasis is of major prognostic significance for breast cancer. Lymph node metastasis arises at a very early stage in some patients. Using the data downloaded from the TCGA database, we studied the differences between primary tumors with and without lymph node metastasis at the multi-omics level using bioinformatics approaches. Our study found that low mutation and neoantigen burdens correlated with lymph node metastazation of breast cancer. All three conserved domains in TP53 were mutated in lymph node-negative breast cancers, whereas only one domain was mutated in lymph node-positive samples. Mutations in microtubule-related proteins appear to help immune cells recognize tumors and inhibit their lymph node metastasis. Destroying microtubule-related proteins is a potential therapeutic strategy to inhibit lymph node metastasis of breast cancer. As the neoantigens specifically present in lymph node-positive breast cancers, MAPK10, BC9L, TRIM65, CD93, KITLG, CNPPD1, CPED1, CCDC146, TMEM185A, INO80D, and PSMD11 are potential targets for vaccine design. In the tumor microenvironment, reduced numbers of effector immune cells, especially activated memory CD4+ T cells and activated mast cells, facilitate breast cancer metastasis to the lymph nodes. According to transcriptome data, lymph node metastasis was mostly driven by gene mutation rather than by gene expression. Although differential gene expression analysis was based on lymph node metastasis status, many genes were shown to be differentially expressed based on estrogen receptor status. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Fibroblasts turn into cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumour microenvironment. CAFs have recently attracted attention for their function as a regulator of immune cell recruitment and function in addition to their tumour-promoting roles. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of CAFs on monocyte recruitment and macrophage polarization in breast cancer. CAFs, which were α-SMA expressing fibroblasts in contrast to normal fibroblasts (NFs), effectively recruited monocytes. Recruitment of monocytes by CAFs might be mediated by monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) as well as stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) cytokines. CAFs differentiated the recruited monocytes into M2-like macrophages which are capable of exerting their immunosuppressive roles via the PD-1 axis. CAF-educated monocytes exhibited strong immune suppression unlike NF-educated monocytes and enhanced the motility/invasion of breast cancer cells in addition to increasing the expressions of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes and vimentin protein in cancer cells. CAF-educated M1 macrophages displayed increased expression of M2 markers and production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in contrast to decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12 compared with control M1 macrophages; suggesting that CAFs were also able to induce the trans-differentiation of M1 macrophages to M2 macrophages. We then investigated the relationship between the infiltration of CAFs and tumour associated macrophages (TAMs) using tissue samples obtained from breast cancer patients. High grade of CAFs significantly correlated with the number of TAMs in human breast cancer tissue samples. It was also associated with higher Ki-67 proliferation index, and higher tumour volume. This result is in line with our finding of increased breast cancer cell proliferation due to the effects of CAF-educated monocytes in vitro. Our results concluded that CAFs play pivotal roles in sculpturing the tumour microenvironment in breast cancer, and therapeutic strategies to reverse the CAF-mediated immunosuppressive microenvironment should be taken into consideration. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

We construct iCells of four cancers and the corresponding tissue controls and identify the most rewired genes in cancer. Many of them are of unknown function and cannot be identified as different in cancer in any specific molecular network. We biologically validate that they have a role in cancer by knockdown experiments followed by cell viability assays. We find additional support through Kaplan-Meier survival curves of thousands of patients. Finally, we extend this analysis to uncover pan-cancer genes.

The increasing popularity of sequencing technologies motivates the in-silico identification of CCLs based on their mutational fingerprint, but care must be taken when identifying heterogeneous data. We recently developed the proof-of-concept Uniquorn 1 method which could reliably identify heterogeneous sequencing data from selected sequencing technologies. Here we present Uniquorn 2, a generic and robust in-silico identification method for CCLs with DNA/RNA-seq and panel-seq information. We benchmarked Uniquorn 2 by cross-identifying 1612 RNA and 3596 panel-sized NGS profiles derived from 1516 CCLs, five repositories, four technologies and three major cancer panel-designs. Our method achieves an accuracy of 96% for RNA-seq and 95% for mixed DNA-seq and RNA-seq identification. Even for a panel of only 94 cancer-related genes, accuracy remains at 82% but decreases when using smaller panels.

In this ex vivo study of nine fresh human colon specimens, we report the first use of quantified subsurface scattering coefficient maps acquired by swept-source optical coherence tomography to reveal subsurface abnormities. We generate subsurface scattering coefficient maps with a novel wavelet-based-curve-fitting method that provides significantly improved accuracy. The angular spectra of scattering coefficient maps of normal tissues exhibit a spatial feature distinct from those of abnormal tissues. An angular spectrum index to quantify the differences between the normal and abnormal tissues is derived, and its strength in revealing subsurface cancer in ex vivo samples is statistically analyzed. The study demonstrates that the angular spectrum of the scattering coefficient map can effectively reveal subsurface colorectal cancer and potentially provide a fast and more accurate diagnosis. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Current options in palliation such as hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) present severe side effects. Recent research efforts suggested the therapeutic use of oxidant-enriched liquid using cold physical plasma. To investigate a clinically accepted treatment regimen, we assessed the antitumor capacity of plasma-treated saline solution. In response to such liquid, CT26 murine colon cancer cells were readily oxidized and showed cell growth with subsequent apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and upregulation of immunogenic cell death (ICD) markers in vitro. This was accompanied by marked morphological changes with re-arrangement of actin fibers and reduced motility. Induction of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype was not observed. Key results were confirmed in MC38 colon and PDA6606 pancreatic cancer cells. Compared to plasma-treated saline, hydrogen peroxide was inferiorly toxic in 3D tumor spheroids but of similar efficacy in 2D models. In vivo, plasma-treated saline decreased tumor burden in Balb/C mice. This was concomitant with elevated numbers of intratumoral macrophages and increased T cell activation following incubation with CT26 cells ex vivo. Being a potential adjuvant for HIPEC therapy, our results suggest oxidizing saline solutions to inactivate colon cancer cells while potentially stimulating antitumor immune responses. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Although solid fuel combustion emissions are known to increase the prevalence of illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer, however, their effect on the eyes is underexplored. This study assesses the acute toxicity of solid fuel combustion emissions on healthy ocular cells and a cancer cell line. Three healthy ocular cell lines (corneal, lens, and retinal epithelial cells) and a cancer cell line (Chinese hamster ovary cells) were exposed to liquid and gas phase emissions from applewood and coal combustion. Following the exposure, real-time cell attachment behavior was monitored for at least 120 hours with electrical cell impedance spectroscopy. The viability of the cells, amount of apoptotic cells, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were quantified with MTT, ApoTox-Glo, and ROS-Glo H 2 O 2 assays, respectively. The results showed that coal emissions compromised the viability of ocular cells more than applewood emissions. Interestingly, the cancer cells, although their viability was not compromised, generated 1.7 to 2.7 times more ROS than healthy cells. This acute exposure study provides compelling proof that biomass combustion emissions compromise the viability of ocular cells and increase ROS generation. The increased ROS generation was fatal for ocular cells, but it promoted the growth of cancer cells. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

The goal of this study was to classify mice with and without tumors and compare tumors localized to the mammary pad and tumor cells injected into the iliac artery by differences in VOCs in urine. After 4T1.2 tumor cells were injected into BALB/c mice either in the mammary pad or into the iliac artery, urine was collected, VOCs from urine headspace were concentrated by solid phase microextraction and results were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry quadrupole time-of-flight. Multivariate and univariate statistical analyses were employed to find potential biomarkers for breast cancer and metastatic breast cancer in mice models. A set of six VOCs classified mice with and without tumors with an area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC AUC) of 0.98 (95% confidence interval [0.85, 1.00]) via five-fold cross validation.

Moreover, the high drug loading capacity of Cet-SLN was employed to encapsulate photothermal agent indocyanine green (ICG) to finally fabricate a versatile drug delivery system (DDS) able to co-deliver Cet and ICG (Cet-SLN/ICG) for combinational chemo-photothermal therapy of breast cancer. The obtained results clearly demonstrated that Cet-SLN/ICG was well-dispersed nanoparticles with preferable stability under physiological condition. Furthermore, due to the conjugation of Cet, Cet-SLN/ICG could target EGFR which overexpress in MCF-7 cells. Most importantly, both in vitro and in vivo results suggested that compared with Cet or ICG alone, the Cet-SLN/ICG showed superior anticancer efficacy.

        fabio:abstract    "The integration of genomic and DNA methylation data has been demonstrated as a powerful strategy in understanding cancer mechanisms and identifying therapeutic targets. The TCGA consortium has mapped DNA methylation in thousands of cancer samples using Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 K BeadChip (Illumina 450 K array) that only covers about 1.5% of CpGs in the human genome. Therefore, increasing the coverage of the DNA methylome would significantly leverage the usage of the TCGA data. Here, we present a new model called EAGLING that can expand the Illumina 450 K array data 18 times to cover about 30% of the CpGs in the human genome. We applied it to analyze 13 cancers in TCGA. By integrating the expanded methylation, gene expression, and somatic mutation data, we identified the genes showing differential patterns in each of the 13 cancers. Many of the triple-evidenced genes identified in majority of the cancers are biomarkers or potential biomarkers. Pan-cancer analysis also revealed the pathways in which the triple-evidenced genes are enriched, which include well known ones as well as new ones, such as axonal guidance signaling pathway and pathways related to inflammatory processing or inflammation response. Triple-evidenced genes, particularly TNXB, RRM2, CELSR3, SLC16A3, FANCI, MMP9, MMP11, SIK1, and TRIM59 showed superior predictive power in both tumor diagnosis and prognosis. These results have demonstrated that the integrative analysis using the expanded methylation data is powerful in identifying critical genes/pathways that may serve as new therapeutic targets. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "A key challenge facing immunotherapy is poor infiltration of T cells into tumors, along with suppression of cells reaching these sites. However, macrophages make up a majority of immune cell infiltrates into tumors, creating natural targets for immunotherapies able to direct macrophages away from tumor-supportive functions and toward anti-tumor phenotypes. Recent studies demonstrate that toll-like receptors (TLRs) – pathways that quickly trigger early immune responses – play an important role in polarizing macrophages. Here, we present emerging ways in which TLR signaling is being manipulated in macrophages to create new opportunities for cancer immunotherapy. In particular, we discuss approaches to deliver TLR agonists, to leverage biomaterials in these therapies, and to couple TLR-based approaches with other frontline treatments as combination cancer therapies. © 2018" ;

However, immune checkpoint inhibitors are only advantageous for a limited population of cancer patients. Therefore, companion diagnostics are needed in order to identify patients for whom these therapies are effective. In the present study, we evaluated detailed immunological aspects in clinical specimens from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. We analyzed the immune profiles, T cell cytotoxicity, and TCR repertoire of peripheral blood, normal lung tissue, and tumor tissue from NSCLC patients. By using bispecific T-cell engager technology to assess the cytotoxicity of T cells, we found that the cytotoxicity of tumor-infiltrated T cells closely correlated with that of peripheral T cells. This correlation was supported by the immune profiles, cytokine production, and results of the TCR repertoire analysis from these specimens. We also found that the cytotoxicity of peripheral T cells has potential as a predictor of the effects of nivolumab in the tumor microenvironment. These results imply further applications to blood-based immune monitoring systems and predictive biomarkers for cancer immunotherapy. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

This standard procedure relies on the slow radioactivity loss, usually attributed to the limited tumour expression of G6P-phosphatase (G6Pase). However, this classical interpretation intrinsically represents an approximation since, as in all tissues, cancer G6Pase activity is remarkable and is confined to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whose lumen must be reached by phosphorylated FDG to explain its hydrolysis and radioactivity release. The present study tested the impact of G6Pase sequestration on the mathematical description of FDG trafficking and handling in cultured cancer cells. Our data show that accounting for tracer access to the ER configures this compartment as the preferential site of FDG accumulation. This is confirmed by the reticular localization of fluorescent FDG analogues. Remarkably enough, reticular accumulation rate of FDG is dependent upon extracellular glucose availability, thus configuring the same ER as a significant determinant of cancer glucose metabolism. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Although current methods of treatment for cervical cancer can ablate lesions, preventing metastatic disseminations and excessive tissue injuries still remains a major concern. Hence, development of a safer and more efficient treatment modality is of vital importance. Natural products from plants are one of the principal sources of precursors to lead compounds with direct pharmaceutical application across all disease classes. One of these plants is Ficus carica, whose fruit latex, when applied on HPV-induced skin warts, has shown potential as a possible cure for this virus related lesions. This study explores the in vitro biological activities of fig latex and elucidates its possible mechanisms of action on cervical cancer cell lines CaSki and HeLa positive for HPV type 16 and 18, respectively. Our data shows that fig latex inhibits properties that are associated with HPV-positive cervical cancer transformed cells such as rapid growth and invasion and substantially downregulated the expression of p16 and HPV onco-proteins E6, E7. These findings suggest Ficus carica latex has the potential to be used in the development of therapeutic modalities for the possible treatment, cure and prevention of HPV related cervical cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing methods, the diversity and composition of the microbiota from ovarian cancer tissues (25 samples) and normal distal fallopian tube tissues (25 samples) were analyzed. High-throughput sequencing showed that the diversity and richness indexes were significantly decreased in ovarian cancer tissues compared to tissues from normal distal fallopian tubes. The ratio of the two phyla for Proteobacteria/Firmicutes was notably increased in ovarian cancer, which revealed that microbial composition change might be associated with the process of ovarian cancer development. In addition, transcriptome-sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses suggested that the transcriptional profiles were statistically different between ovarian carcinoma and normal distal fallopian tubes. Moreover, a set of genes including 84 different inflammation-associated or immune-associated genes, which had been named as the human antibacterial-response genes were also modulated expression. Therefore, we hypothesize that the microbial composition change, as a novel risk factor, may be involving the initiation and progression of ovarian cancer via influencing and regulating the local immune microenvironment of fallopian tubes except for regular pathways. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Several pioneering work have established that apart from genetic alterations, epigenetic modifications contribute significantly in tumor progression. Remarkable role of EZH2 in cancer highlights the importance of identifying its targets. Although much emphasis has been placed in recent years in designing drugs and inhibitors targeting EZH2, less effort has been given in exploring its existing targets that will help in understanding the oncogenic role of EZH2 in turn which may provide a more stringent method of targeting EZH2. In the present study, we validated six direct targets of EZH2 that are GPNMB, PMEPA1, CoL5A1, VGLL4, POMT2 and SUMF1 associated with cancer related pathways. Upon EZH2 knockdown, more than two fold increase in the target gene expression was evident. CHIP-qPCR performed in both MCF-7 and MDA-MDA-231 confirmed the in-vivo binding of EZH2 on its identified target. Thirty invasive breast carcinoma cases with their adjacent normal tissues were included in the study. Immunohistochemistry in primary breast tumor tissue array showed tumor dependent expression of EZH2. Array of MERAV expression database revealed the strength of association of EZH2 with its target genes. Real time PCR performed with RNA extracted from breast tumor tissues further authenticated the existing negative correlation between EZH2 and its target genes. Pearson correlation coefficient & statistical significance computed using the matrix provided in the database strengthened the negative correlation between identified target genes and EZH2. KM plotter analysis showed improved relapse-free survival with increased expression of PMEPA1, POMT2, VGLL4 and SUMF1 in breast cancer patients indicating their therapeutic potential. While investigating the relevance of these target genes, different mutations of them were found in breast cancer patients. Seeking the clinical relevance of our study, following our recent publication that reports the role of EZH2 in nicotine-mediated breast cancer development and progression, we observed significant reduced expression of SUMF1 in breast cancer patient samples with smoking history in comparison to never-smoked patient samples. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we report that TOP1MT is overexpressed in cancer tissues and demonstrate that TOP1MT deficiency attenuates tumor growth in human and mouse models of colon and liver cancer. Due to their mitochondrial dysfunction, TOP1MT-KO cells become addicted to glycolysis, which limits synthetic building blocks and energy supply required for the proliferation of cancer cells in a nutrient-deprived tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, we show that TOP1MT associates with mitoribosomal subunits, ensuring optimal mitochondrial translation and assembly of oxidative phosphorylation complexes that are critical for sustaining tumor growth. The TOP1MT genomic signature profile, based on Top1mt-KO liver cancers, is correlated with enhanced survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients.

A new data integrative approach, based on graphical models, was applied on our multi-modal –omics, and clinical data cohort of metastatic melanoma patients. We found that response to chemotherapy is directly linked to ten gene expression, four methylation variables and PARP1 SNP rs1805407. PARP1 is a DNA repair gene critical for chemotherapy response and for which FDA-approved inhibitors are clinically available (olaparib). We demonstrated that two PARP inhibitors (ABT-888 and olaparib) make SNP carrier cancer cells of various histologic subtypes more sensitive to alkylating agents, but they have no effect in wild-type cells. Furthermore, PARP1 inhibitors act synergistically with chemotherapy in SNP carrier cells (especially in ovarian cancer for which olaparib is FDA-approved), but they are additive at best in wild-type cancer cells. Taken together, our results suggest that the combination of chemotherapy and PARP1 inhibition may benefit the carriers of rs1805407 in the future and may be used in personalized therapy strategies to select patients that are more likely to respond to PARP inhibitors. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Earlier studies have shown that bovine α -lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells (BAMLET) becomes cytotoxic against cancer cells in complex with oleic acid {Hoque, M. et. al., PLoSOne8, e68390 (2013)}. In our study, we obtained bovine α-lactalbumin complexed with lanthanum ion (La 3+ -B-α-LA) and determined its high resolution crystal structure. The natural calcium binding site of bovine α-lactalbumin is replaced by lanthanum. The La 3+ complex formation by B-α-apo-LA was also supported by various biophysical methods. Interestingly, our complex, La 3+ -B-α-LA exhibits much greater anticancer activity against breast cancer cells as compared to the reported BAMLET-oleic acid complex. This study shows that La 3+ -B-α-LA complex is preferentially more toxic to MCF-7 cells as compared to KB (oral cancer) and HeLa (cervical) cells, while almost non-toxic to the healthy cells that we studied. Our data indicates that the cytotoxicity of La 3+ -B-α-LA against cancer cells is through apoptotic path way. The higher anticancer activity of La 3+ -B-α-LA is attributable to the requisite structural changes induced in the protein by La 3+ binding as supported by the crystal structure of the complex. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

However, no studies have evaluated vascular pain in patients with colorectal cancer in relation to peripheral venous administration of chemotherapy with or without oxaliplatin. We evaluated oxaliplatin-induced vascular pain using subjective and objective methods. We determined if oxaliplatin induced vascular pain in patients with colorectal cancer using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and a PainVision PS-2100 device. We compared VAS score between chemotherapy regimens with or without oxaliplatin, and between genders. We also examined the correlations of VAS score with pain intensity examined by the PainVision PS-2100, and with age and vessel diameter. A total of 98 patients with colorectal cancer were enrolled in this study, including 78 patients who received oxaliplatin via peripheral venous administration and 20 who received chemotherapy without oxaliplatin. The median VAS scores in patients with and without oxaliplatin were 36.5 (interquartile range 9.0–60.0) and 0 (0–4.0), respectively (P < 0.001), and the median pain intensities according to PainVision were 43.5 (14.3–98) and 36.5 (9.3–58.5), respectively (P < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between VAS and pain intensity (r = 0.584), but no correlation between VAS score and age (r = −0.174) or vessel diameter (r = −0.107). Peripheral venous administration of oxaliplatin induced vascular pain, measured both subjectively and objectively, in patients with colorectal cancer, regardless of vessel diameter. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Primary bronchial cancer accounts for almost 20% of all cancer death worldwide. One of the emerging techniques with tremendous power for lung cancer therapy is magnetic aerosol drug targeting (MADT). The use of a permanent magnet for effective drug delivery in a desired location throughout the lung requires extensive optimization, but it has not been addressed yet. In the present study, the possibility of using a permanent magnet for trapping the particles on a lung tumor is evaluated numerically in the Weibel's model from G0 to G3. The effect of different parameters is considered on the efficiency of particle deposition in a tumor located on a distant position of the lung bronchi and bronchioles. Also, the effective position of the magnetic source, tumor size, and location are the objectives for particle deposition. The results show that a limited particle deposition occurs on the lung branches in passive targeting. However, the incorporation of a permanent magnet next to the tumor enhanced the particle deposition fraction on G2 to up to 49% for the particles of 7 µm diameter. Optimizing the magnet size could also improve the particle deposition fraction by 68%. It was also shown that the utilization of MADT is essential for effective drug delivery to the tumors located on the lower wall of airway branches given the dominance of the air velocity and resultant drag force in this region. The results demonstrated the high competence and necessity of MADT as a noninvasive drug delivery method for lung cancer therapy." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. Adjuvant chemotherapy has significantly reduced mortality but increased cognitive impairments, including attention function, making quality of life issues a crucial concern. This study enrolled nineteen breast cancer patients who were treated with standard chemotherapy within 6 months and 20 sex-matched healthy controls to investigate the brain effects of chemotherapy. All participants underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) with mean fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (mfALFF) analysis and were correlated with neuropsychological tests, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised (CAMS-R), and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), to explore the possible underlying mechanism of cognitive alternations. We found increased mfALFF over the frontoparietal lobe and decreased mfALFF over the occipital lobe in the cancer patients compared with the healthy controls; the altered brain regions may be associated with the dorsal attention network (DAN) and may be explained by a compensatory mechanism. Both MMSE and CAMS-R scores showed a positive correlation with mfALFF in the occipital lobe but a negative correlation in the frontoparietal lobe. By contrast, IES-R scores showed a positive correlation with mfALFF in the frontoparietal lobe but a negative correlation in the occipital lobe. These alterations are potentially related to the effects of both chemotherapy and psychological distress. Future research involving a larger sample size of patients with breast cancer is recommended. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

In the case of mutations in individual genes that cause them to be incorrectly spliced, engineered splicing factors can be introduced to correct splicing of these aberrant transcripts and reduce the effects of the disease phenotype. Mutations that occur in certain splicing factor genes themselves have been implicated in many cancers, particularly myelodysplastic syndromes. Small molecules that target splicing factors have been developed as therapies to preferentially induce apoptosis in these cancer cells. Specifically, drugs targeting the splicing factor SF3B1 have led to recent clinical trials.

Analysis of AA-reconstructed amplicons in a pan-cancer dataset reveals many novel properties of copy number amplifications in cancer. These findings support a model in which focal amplifications arise due to the formation and replication of extrachromosomal DNA. Applying AA to 68 viral-mediated cancer samples, we identify a large fraction of amplicons with specific structural signatures suggestive of hybrid, human-viral extrachromosomal DNA.

There have been many attempts to identify markers and key pathways induced throughout EMT but the process is complex and depends on the cancer type and tumour microenvironment. Here we used the colon cancer cell line HT29, which stably overexpressed Snail, the key transcription factor in early EMT, as a model for colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with a pro-metastatic phenotype. We investigated miRNA expression regulation during that phenotypic switching. We found that overexpression of Snail in HT29 cells triggered significant changes in individual miRNA levels but did not change the global efficiency of miRNA processing. Snail abundance repressed the expression of miR-192 and miR-194 and increased miR-205, let-7i and SNORD13 levels. These identified changes correlated with the reported transcriptomic alterations in Snail-overexpressing HT29 cells. We also investigated how Snail affected the miRNA content of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from HT29 cells. Our data suggest that the presence of Snail significantly alters the complex mRNA/miRNA interactions in the early steps of metastasis and also has an impact on the content of EVs released from HT29 cells. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

This retrospective case-control study compared patients who had lung cancer with PJP (n = 112) or without PJP (n = 336) matched according to age, sex, histopathology, and stage. PJP definition was based on (i) positive PCR or direct immunofluorescence results for pneumocystis, (ii) clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities that were consistent with a pneumonic process, and (iii) received targeted PJP treatment. The development of PJP was associated with radiotherapy (RTx), concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRTx), lymphopenia, and prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (20 mg of prednisolone equivalent per day for ≥3 weeks). Multivariate analysis revealed independent associations with prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06–3.63; p = 0.032) and CCRTx (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.27–3.43; p = 0.004). Steroid use was frequently related to RTx pneumonitis or esophagitis (29 patients, 43.3%). Prolonged high-dose steroid therapy and CCRTx were risk factors for PJP development among patients with lung cancer. As these patients had a poor prognosis, clinicians should consider PJP prophylaxis for high-risk patients with lung cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

We performed an in silico analysis to determine the concordance in the frequencies of actionable mutations and copy number alterations/aberrations (CNAs) in the two most common breast cancer histologies, invasive lobular and invasive ductal carcinoma. We found that targeted sequencing identified a larger number of mutational hotspots and clinically significant amplifications that would have been missed by WES and SNP arrays in many actionable genes such as PIK3CA, EGFR, AKT3, FGFR1, ERBB2, ERBB3 and ESR1. The striking differences between the number of mutational hotspots and CNAs generated from these platforms highlight a number of factors that should be considered in the interpretation of array and NGS-based genomic data for precision medicine.

Several oxaliplatin transporters were previously identified but their relative contributions to determining oxaliplatin tumour responses and gastrointestinal tumour cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin remains unclear. We studied clinical associations between tumour expression of oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes and patient response to oxaliplatin, then experimentally verified associations found with MRP2 in models of human gastrointestinal cancer. Among 18 oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes, MRP2 was the only one to be differentially expressed in the tumours of colorectal cancer patients who did or did not respond to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Over-expression of MRP2 (endogenously in HepG2 and PANC-1 cells, or induced by stable transfection of HEK293 cells) decreased oxaliplatin accumulation and cytotoxicity but those deficits were reversed by inhibition of MRP2 with myricetin or siRNA knockdown. Mice bearing subcutaneous HepG2 tumour xenografts were sensitised to oxaliplatin antitumour activity by concurrent myricetin treatment with little or no increase in toxicity. In conclusion, MRP2 limits oxaliplatin accumulation and response in human gastrointestinal cancer.

We compare optimized gene signatures for cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin responses in the same cell lines and validate each signature using data from patients with cancer. Supervised support vector machine learning is used to derive gene sets whose expression is related to the cell line GI50 values by backwards feature selection with cross-validation. Specific genes and functional pathways distinguishing sensitive from resistant cell lines are identified by contrasting signatures obtained at extreme and median GI50 thresholds. Ensembles of gene signatures at different thresholds are combined to reduce the dependence on specific GI50 values for predicting drug responses. The most accurate gene signatures for each platin are: cisplatin: BARD1, BCL2, BCL2L1, CDKN2C, FAAP24, FEN1, MAP3K1, MAPK13, MAPK3, NFKB1, NFKB2, SLC22A5, SLC31A2, TLR4, and TWIST1; carboplatin: AKT1, EIF3K, ERCC1, GNGT1, GSR, MTHFR, NEDD4L, NLRP1, NRAS, RAF1, SGK1, TIGD1, TP53, VEGFB, and VEGFC; and oxaliplatin: BRAF, FCGR2A, IGF1, MSH2, NAGK, NFE2L2, NQO1, PANK3, SLC47A1, SLCO1B1, and UGT1A1. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with bladder, ovarian, and colorectal cancer were used to test the cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin signatures, resulting in 71.0%, 60.2%, and 54.5% accuracies in predicting disease recurrence and 59%, 61%, and 72% accuracies in predicting remission, respectively. One cisplatin signature predicted 100% of recurrence in non-smoking patients with bladder cancer (57% disease-free; N = 19), and 79% recurrence in smokers (62% disease-free; N = 35).

MTH1 dephosphorylates oxidized nucleotides, thereby preventing their incorporation into DNA and protecting tumour cells from oxidative DNA damage. Inhibitors of MTH1 (TH588 and (S)-crizotinib) were shown to reduce cancer cell viability. However, the MTH1-dependency of the anti-cancer effects of these drugs has recently been questioned. Here, we have assessed anti-tumour effects of TH588 and (S)-crizotinib in patient-derived 3D colorectal cancer cultures. Hypoxia and reoxygenation – conditions that increase intracellular ROS levels – increased sensitivity to (S)-crizotinib, but not to TH588. (S)-crizotinib reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-MET and ErbB3 whereas TH588 induced a mitotic cell cycle arrest, which was not affected by adding ROS-modulating compounds. Furthermore, we show that both compounds induced DNA damage that could not be prevented by adding the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Moreover, adding ROS-modulating compounds did not alter the reduction in viability in response to TH588 and (S)-crizotinib. We conclude that TH588 and (S)-crizotinib have very clear and distinct anti-tumour effects in 3D colorectal cancer cultures, but that these effects most likely occur through distinct and ROS-independent mechanisms. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Iron deposits are a phenotypic trait of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Histological iron imaging and contrast-agent free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect these deposits, but their presence in human cancer, and correlation with immunotherapeutic response is largely untested. Here, primarily using these iron imaging approaches, we evaluated the spatial distribution of polarized macrophage populations containing high endogenous levels of iron in preclinical murine models and human breast cancer, and used them as metabolic biomarkers to correlate TAM infiltration with response to immunotherapy in preclinical trials. Macrophage-targeted inhibition of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) by immunotherapy was confirmed to inhibit macrophage accumulation and slow mammary tumor growth in mouse models while also reducing hemosiderin iron-laden TAM accumulation as measured by both iron histology and in vivo iron MRI (FeMRI). Spatial profiling of TAM iron deposit infiltration defined regions of maximal accumulation and response to the CSF1R inhibitor, and revealed differences between microenvironments of human cancer according to levels of polarized macrophage iron accumulation in stromal margins. We therefore demonstrate that iron deposition serves as an endogenous metabolic imaging biomarker of TAM infiltration in breast cancer that has high translational potential for evaluation of immunotherapeutic response. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "More than 50% of colon cancers bear mutations in p53, one of the most important tumor suppressors, and its family members p63 or p73 are expected to contribute to inhibiting the progression of colon cancers. The AP2 family also acts as a tumor suppressor. Here we found that p73 and AP2 are able to activate NEU4, a neuraminidase gene, which removes the terminal sialic acid residues from cancer-associated glycans. Under serum starvation, NEU4 was up-regulated and one of the NEU4 target glycans, sialyl Lewis X, was decreased, whereas p73 and AP2 were up-regulated. Sialyl Lewis X levels were not, however, decreased under starvation conditions in p73- or AP2-knockdown cells. p53 and AP2 underwent protein-protein interactions, exerting synergistic effects to activate p21, and interaction of p53 with AP2 was lost in cells expressing the L350P mutation of p53. The homologous residues in p63 and p73 are L423 and L377, respectively. The synergistic effect of p53/p63 with AP2 to activate genes was lost with the L350P/L423P mutation in p53/p63, but p73 bearing the L377P mutation was able to interact with AP2 and exerted its normal synergistic effects. We propose that p73 and AP2 synergistically activate the NEU4 promoter in colon cancer cells. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Nanoparticles prepared by single emulsion method had a size of less than 300 nm with 70.7 ± 3.9% reaction yield and 26.4 ± 1.1% Hsp loading capacity. Treatment of C6 glioma cells with HspNPs for 24 and 48 h resulted in dose- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability, with approximate IC50 of 28 and 21 μg/mL, respectively (p = .036 for 24 h, p = .025 for 48 h). The percentage of PCNA positive cells decreased to 20% and 10%, respectively, for Hsp- and HspNP-treated cells at concentration of 100 µg/mL. Treatment with increasing concentrations of HspNPs (25, 50, 75 and 100 µg/mL) resulted in 9.1-, 7-, 12.5- and 12.7-fold in increase in apoptotic cell number. Optimum doses of Hsp and HspNPs were found to increase oxidative damage in C6 glioma cells. MDA levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were found to be significantly elevated at 75 and 100 µg/mL exposure concentration of HspNPs with (p = .002) and (p = .018), respectively for 48-h treatment. The results obtained with this study showed biocompatible polymeric nanoparticle systems has great advantages to enhance anti-cancer activity and poor solubility of therapeutic agents. Overall our findings suggest that Hsp-loaded PLGA nanoparticle systems showed significant anti-cancer activity and HspNPs could be used as promising novel anti-cancer agent." ;

GO exhibits pH-dependent fluorescence emission in the visible/near-infrared, providing a possibility of molecular imaging and pH-sensing. It is also water soluble and has a substantial platform for functionalization, allowing for the delivery of multiple therapeutics. GO physical properties are modified to enhance cellular internalization, producing fluorescent nanoflakes with low (<15%) cytotoxicity at the imaging concentrations of 15 μg/mL. As a result, at lower flake sizes GO rapidly internalizes into HeLa cells with the following 70% fluorescence based clearance at 24 h, assessed by its characteristic emission in red/near-IR. pH-dependence of GO emission is utilized to provide the sensing of acidic extracellular environments of cancer cells. The results demonstrate diminishing green/red (550/630 nm) fluorescence intensity ratios for HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells in comparison to HEK-293 healthy cells suggesting a potential use of GO as a non-invasive optical sensor for cancer microenvironments.

There have been many attempts to identify markers and key pathways induced throughout EMT but the process is complex and depends on the cancer type and tumour microenvironment. Here we used the colon cancer cell line HT29, which stably overexpressed Snail, the key transcription factor in early EMT, as a model for colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with a pro-metastatic phenotype. We investigated miRNA expression regulation during that phenotypic switching. We found that overexpression of Snail in HT29 cells triggered significant changes in individual miRNA levels but did not change the global efficiency of miRNA processing. Snail abundance repressed the expression of miR-192 and miR-194 and increased miR-205, let-7i and SNORD13 levels. These identified changes correlated with the reported transcriptomic alterations in Snail-overexpressing HT29 cells. We also investigated how Snail affected the miRNA content of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from HT29 cells. Our data suggest that the presence of Snail significantly alters the complex mRNA/miRNA interactions in the early steps of metastasis and also has an impact on the content of EVs released from HT29 cells. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

This retrospective case-control study compared patients who had lung cancer with PJP (n = 112) or without PJP (n = 336) matched according to age, sex, histopathology, and stage. PJP definition was based on (i) positive PCR or direct immunofluorescence results for pneumocystis, (ii) clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities that were consistent with a pneumonic process, and (iii) received targeted PJP treatment. The development of PJP was associated with radiotherapy (RTx), concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRTx), lymphopenia, and prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (20 mg of prednisolone equivalent per day for ≥3 weeks). Multivariate analysis revealed independent associations with prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06–3.63; p = 0.032) and CCRTx (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.27–3.43; p = 0.004). Steroid use was frequently related to RTx pneumonitis or esophagitis (29 patients, 43.3%). Prolonged high-dose steroid therapy and CCRTx were risk factors for PJP development among patients with lung cancer. As these patients had a poor prognosis, clinicians should consider PJP prophylaxis for high-risk patients with lung cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

We performed an in silico analysis to determine the concordance in the frequencies of actionable mutations and copy number alterations/aberrations (CNAs) in the two most common breast cancer histologies, invasive lobular and invasive ductal carcinoma. We found that targeted sequencing identified a larger number of mutational hotspots and clinically significant amplifications that would have been missed by WES and SNP arrays in many actionable genes such as PIK3CA, EGFR, AKT3, FGFR1, ERBB2, ERBB3 and ESR1. The striking differences between the number of mutational hotspots and CNAs generated from these platforms highlight a number of factors that should be considered in the interpretation of array and NGS-based genomic data for precision medicine.

Several oxaliplatin transporters were previously identified but their relative contributions to determining oxaliplatin tumour responses and gastrointestinal tumour cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin remains unclear. We studied clinical associations between tumour expression of oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes and patient response to oxaliplatin, then experimentally verified associations found with MRP2 in models of human gastrointestinal cancer. Among 18 oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes, MRP2 was the only one to be differentially expressed in the tumours of colorectal cancer patients who did or did not respond to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Over-expression of MRP2 (endogenously in HepG2 and PANC-1 cells, or induced by stable transfection of HEK293 cells) decreased oxaliplatin accumulation and cytotoxicity but those deficits were reversed by inhibition of MRP2 with myricetin or siRNA knockdown. Mice bearing subcutaneous HepG2 tumour xenografts were sensitised to oxaliplatin antitumour activity by concurrent myricetin treatment with little or no increase in toxicity. In conclusion, MRP2 limits oxaliplatin accumulation and response in human gastrointestinal cancer.

We compare optimized gene signatures for cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin responses in the same cell lines and validate each signature using data from patients with cancer. Supervised support vector machine learning is used to derive gene sets whose expression is related to the cell line GI50 values by backwards feature selection with cross-validation. Specific genes and functional pathways distinguishing sensitive from resistant cell lines are identified by contrasting signatures obtained at extreme and median GI50 thresholds. Ensembles of gene signatures at different thresholds are combined to reduce the dependence on specific GI50 values for predicting drug responses. The most accurate gene signatures for each platin are: cisplatin: BARD1, BCL2, BCL2L1, CDKN2C, FAAP24, FEN1, MAP3K1, MAPK13, MAPK3, NFKB1, NFKB2, SLC22A5, SLC31A2, TLR4, and TWIST1; carboplatin: AKT1, EIF3K, ERCC1, GNGT1, GSR, MTHFR, NEDD4L, NLRP1, NRAS, RAF1, SGK1, TIGD1, TP53, VEGFB, and VEGFC; and oxaliplatin: BRAF, FCGR2A, IGF1, MSH2, NAGK, NFE2L2, NQO1, PANK3, SLC47A1, SLCO1B1, and UGT1A1. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with bladder, ovarian, and colorectal cancer were used to test the cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin signatures, resulting in 71.0%, 60.2%, and 54.5% accuracies in predicting disease recurrence and 59%, 61%, and 72% accuracies in predicting remission, respectively. One cisplatin signature predicted 100% of recurrence in non-smoking patients with bladder cancer (57% disease-free; N = 19), and 79% recurrence in smokers (62% disease-free; N = 35).

MTH1 dephosphorylates oxidized nucleotides, thereby preventing their incorporation into DNA and protecting tumour cells from oxidative DNA damage. Inhibitors of MTH1 (TH588 and (S)-crizotinib) were shown to reduce cancer cell viability. However, the MTH1-dependency of the anti-cancer effects of these drugs has recently been questioned. Here, we have assessed anti-tumour effects of TH588 and (S)-crizotinib in patient-derived 3D colorectal cancer cultures. Hypoxia and reoxygenation – conditions that increase intracellular ROS levels – increased sensitivity to (S)-crizotinib, but not to TH588. (S)-crizotinib reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-MET and ErbB3 whereas TH588 induced a mitotic cell cycle arrest, which was not affected by adding ROS-modulating compounds. Furthermore, we show that both compounds induced DNA damage that could not be prevented by adding the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Moreover, adding ROS-modulating compounds did not alter the reduction in viability in response to TH588 and (S)-crizotinib. We conclude that TH588 and (S)-crizotinib have very clear and distinct anti-tumour effects in 3D colorectal cancer cultures, but that these effects most likely occur through distinct and ROS-independent mechanisms. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Iron deposits are a phenotypic trait of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Histological iron imaging and contrast-agent free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect these deposits, but their presence in human cancer, and correlation with immunotherapeutic response is largely untested. Here, primarily using these iron imaging approaches, we evaluated the spatial distribution of polarized macrophage populations containing high endogenous levels of iron in preclinical murine models and human breast cancer, and used them as metabolic biomarkers to correlate TAM infiltration with response to immunotherapy in preclinical trials. Macrophage-targeted inhibition of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) by immunotherapy was confirmed to inhibit macrophage accumulation and slow mammary tumor growth in mouse models while also reducing hemosiderin iron-laden TAM accumulation as measured by both iron histology and in vivo iron MRI (FeMRI). Spatial profiling of TAM iron deposit infiltration defined regions of maximal accumulation and response to the CSF1R inhibitor, and revealed differences between microenvironments of human cancer according to levels of polarized macrophage iron accumulation in stromal margins. We therefore demonstrate that iron deposition serves as an endogenous metabolic imaging biomarker of TAM infiltration in breast cancer that has high translational potential for evaluation of immunotherapeutic response. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "More than 50% of colon cancers bear mutations in p53, one of the most important tumor suppressors, and its family members p63 or p73 are expected to contribute to inhibiting the progression of colon cancers. The AP2 family also acts as a tumor suppressor. Here we found that p73 and AP2 are able to activate NEU4, a neuraminidase gene, which removes the terminal sialic acid residues from cancer-associated glycans. Under serum starvation, NEU4 was up-regulated and one of the NEU4 target glycans, sialyl Lewis X, was decreased, whereas p73 and AP2 were up-regulated. Sialyl Lewis X levels were not, however, decreased under starvation conditions in p73- or AP2-knockdown cells. p53 and AP2 underwent protein-protein interactions, exerting synergistic effects to activate p21, and interaction of p53 with AP2 was lost in cells expressing the L350P mutation of p53. The homologous residues in p63 and p73 are L423 and L377, respectively. The synergistic effect of p53/p63 with AP2 to activate genes was lost with the L350P/L423P mutation in p53/p63, but p73 bearing the L377P mutation was able to interact with AP2 and exerted its normal synergistic effects. We propose that p73 and AP2 synergistically activate the NEU4 promoter in colon cancer cells. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Nanoparticles prepared by single emulsion method had a size of less than 300 nm with 70.7 ± 3.9% reaction yield and 26.4 ± 1.1% Hsp loading capacity. Treatment of C6 glioma cells with HspNPs for 24 and 48 h resulted in dose- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability, with approximate IC50 of 28 and 21 μg/mL, respectively (p = .036 for 24 h, p = .025 for 48 h). The percentage of PCNA positive cells decreased to 20% and 10%, respectively, for Hsp- and HspNP-treated cells at concentration of 100 µg/mL. Treatment with increasing concentrations of HspNPs (25, 50, 75 and 100 µg/mL) resulted in 9.1-, 7-, 12.5- and 12.7-fold in increase in apoptotic cell number. Optimum doses of Hsp and HspNPs were found to increase oxidative damage in C6 glioma cells. MDA levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were found to be significantly elevated at 75 and 100 µg/mL exposure concentration of HspNPs with (p = .002) and (p = .018), respectively for 48-h treatment. The results obtained with this study showed biocompatible polymeric nanoparticle systems has great advantages to enhance anti-cancer activity and poor solubility of therapeutic agents. Overall our findings suggest that Hsp-loaded PLGA nanoparticle systems showed significant anti-cancer activity and HspNPs could be used as promising novel anti-cancer agent." ;

GO exhibits pH-dependent fluorescence emission in the visible/near-infrared, providing a possibility of molecular imaging and pH-sensing. It is also water soluble and has a substantial platform for functionalization, allowing for the delivery of multiple therapeutics. GO physical properties are modified to enhance cellular internalization, producing fluorescent nanoflakes with low (<15%) cytotoxicity at the imaging concentrations of 15 μg/mL. As a result, at lower flake sizes GO rapidly internalizes into HeLa cells with the following 70% fluorescence based clearance at 24 h, assessed by its characteristic emission in red/near-IR. pH-dependence of GO emission is utilized to provide the sensing of acidic extracellular environments of cancer cells. The results demonstrate diminishing green/red (550/630 nm) fluorescence intensity ratios for HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells in comparison to HEK-293 healthy cells suggesting a potential use of GO as a non-invasive optical sensor for cancer microenvironments. The results of this work demonstrate the potential of GO as a novel multifunctional platform for therapeutic delivery, biological imaging and cancer sensing. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Patients with primary cervical cancer and newly diagnosed were selected from ten different cancer specialist hospitals of Malaysia. Patients’ demographic and clinical data were obtained for the prognostic analysis. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate patients’ survival time (CSS and OS) with DM status and values were compared using the log-rank test. A total of 19,785 newly diagnosed CC patients were registered during 2010–2016, among them only 16,946 (85.6%) with primary CC tumor. There was no difference in treatment modality between DM and non-DM patients. However intergroup assessment showed that type 2DM have significantly higher rate of mortality in both overall mortality (28.3%) and CC-specific (11.7%) as compared to Type 1DM (17.3%; 5.5%) and non DM patients (12.7%; 9.1%) (p < 0.001). Within group assessments showed that Type 2DM patients have better quality of life (mean 7.13 ± 3.67) (p < 0.001) and less distress levels (mean 2.41 ± 0.63) (p < 0.011) as compared to type1 DM (meant 10.54 ± 2.11; 3.19 ± 1.07).

In order to tackle cancer heterogeneity and comply with the data dimensionality, a number of network and pathway approaches were invented but rarely systematically applied to this task. We propose a new method, called NEAmarker, for finding sensitive and robust biomarkers at the pathway level. scores from network enrichment analysis transform the original space of altered genes into a lower-dimensional space of pathways. These dimensions are then correlated with phenotype variables. The method was first tested using in vitro data from three anti-cancer drug screens and then on clinical data of The Cancer Genome Atlas. It proved superior to the single-gene and alternative enrichment analyses in terms of (1) universal applicability to different data types with a possibility of cross-platform integration, (2) consistency of the discovered correlates between independent drug screens, and (3) ability to explain differential survival of treated patients. Our new screen of anti-cancer compounds validated the performance of multivariate models of drug sensitivity. The previously proposed methods of enrichment analysis could achieve comparable levels of performance in certain tests. However, only our method could discover predictors of both in vitro response and patient survival given administration of the same drug. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

SPIONs entrapped in the core of the nanocomplex may act as a hyperthermia agent and generate localized heat upon excitation with an alternating magnetic field (AMF), thus enabling a thermo-chemotherapy strategy for cancer treatment. Accordingly, the cytotoxic effect and the mode of cell death triggered by the nanocomplex in combination with AMF were evaluated on two different cancer cell lines with various folate receptor (FR) expression levels, including KB nasopharyngeal cancer cells overexpressing FRs as the model and MCF-7 breast cancer cells with low level of FRs as the blank sample. The obtained results showed that KB cell death was greater than the cell death observed in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, a majority of cell death in both cell lines were related to apoptosis when the folate-modified nanocomplex was used instated of the non-folate-modified nanocomplex. Therefore, functionalizing the nanocomplex with folate modulated the response to thermo-chemotherapy by shifting the cell death pathways toward apoptosis." ;

This cohort study included 128 HER2-positive breast cancer who received NAC with trastuzumab. TILs grading of the tumor stroma in pretreatment biopsy specimens and residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab was categorized as low, intermediate, and high based on the criteria of the International Working Group. In current study, the pCR rate was 64.8%, and the Relapse-free survival (RFS) was significantly worse in the non-pCR group than in the pCR group. The pCR rate correlated with the TILs grade in pretreatment tumors. In 45 non-pCR patients, TILs grade was higher in the residual tumors than in the pretreatment tumors. The RFS was significantly better in residual tumors with high TILs grade than those with low TILs grade (p = 0.033). In conclusion, assessment of the TILs grade in residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab might be necessary to determine patients with good prognosis among those who do not achieve pCR. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Most targeting strategies of anticancer drug delivery systems (DDSs) rely on the surface functionalization of nanocarriers with specific ligands, which trigger the internalization in cancer cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The endocytosis implies the entrapment of DDSs in acidic vesicles (endosomes and lysosomes) and their eventual ejection by exocytosis. This process, intrinsic to eukaryotic cells, is one of the main drawbacks of DDSs because it reduces the drug bioavailability in the intracellular environment. The escape of DDSs from the acidic vesicles is, therefore, crucial to enhance the therapeutic performance at low drug dose. To this end, we developed a multifunctionalized DDS that combines high specificity towards cancer cells with endosomal escape capabilities. Doxorubicin-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles were functionalized with polyethylenimine, a polymer commonly used to induce endosomal rupture, and hyaluronic acid, which binds to CD44 receptors, overexpressed in cancer cells. We show irrefutable proof that the developed DDS can escape the endosomal pathway upon polymeric functionalization. Interestingly, the combination of the two polymers resulted in higher endosomal escape efficiency than the polyethylenimine coating alone. Hyaluronic acid additionally provides the system with cancer targeting capability and enzymatically controlled drug release. Thanks to this multifunctionality, the engineered DDS had cytotoxicity comparable to the pure drug whilst displaying high specificity towards cancer cells. The polymeric engineering here developed enhances the performance of DDS at low drug dose, holding great potential for anticancer therapeutic applications. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The use of oncolytic viruses (OVs) for cancer treatment is emerging as a successful strategy that combines the direct, targeted killing of the cancer with the induction of a long-lasting anti-tumor immune response. Using multiple aggressive murine models of triple-negative breast cancer, we have recently demonstrated that the early administration of oncolytic Maraba virus (MRB) prior to surgical resection of the primary tumor is sufficient to minimize the metastatic burden, protect against tumor rechallenge, cure a fraction of the mice and sensitize refractory tumors to immune checkpoint blockade without the need for further treatment. Here, we apply our surgical model to other OVs: Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Adenovirus (Ad), Reovirus (Reo) and Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and show that all of the tested OVs could positively change the outcome of the treated animals. The growth of the primary and secondary tumors was differently affected by the various OVs and most of the viruses conferred survival benefits in this neoadjuvant setting despite the absence of direct treatment following rechallenge. This study establishes that OV-therapy confers long-term protection when administered in the pre-operative window of opportunity. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase is overexpressed in approximately 15–20% of breast tumors and associated with aggressive disease and poor clinical outcome. p130Cas represents a nodal scaffold protein regulating cell survival, migration and proliferation in normal and pathological contexts. p130Cas overexpression in ErbB2 human breast cancer correlates with poor prognosis and metastasis formation. Recent data indicate that p130Cas association to ErbB2 protects ErbB2 from degradation, thus enhancing tumorigenesis. Therefore, inhibiting p130Cas/ErbB2 interaction might represent a new therapeutic strategy to target breast cancer. Here we demonstrate by performing Molecular Modeling, Molecular Dynamics, dot blot, ELISA and fluorescence quenching experiments, that p130Cas binds directly to ErbB2. Then, by structure-based virtual screening, we identified two potential inhibitors of p130Cas/ErbB2 interaction. Their experimental validation was performed in vitro and in ErbB2-positive breast cancer cellular models. The results highlight that both compounds interfere with p130Cas/ErbB2 binding and significantly affect cell proliferation and sensitivity to Trastuzumab. Overall, this study identifies p130Cas/ErbB2 complex as a potential breast cancer target revealing new therapeutic perspectives for protein-protein interaction (PPI). © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Gastric cancer (GC) ranks as the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, and approximately 42% of all cases diagnosed each year worldwide are diagnosed in China. A large number of clinical applications have revealed that Trametes robiniophila Μurr. (Huaier) exhibits an anti-tumour effect. However, loss of the bioactive components of Huaier during the extraction procedure with water is unavoidable, and the underlying mechanism of the anti-cancer effect of Huaier remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer effect of Huaier n-butanol extract, which contained 51.4% total flavonoids, on HGC27, MGC803, and AGS human GC cell lines in vitro. At a low concentration, Huaier n-butanol extract inhibited the growth of these GC cell types, induced cell cycle arrest and reduced cell metastasis. Moreover, Huaier n-butanol extract suppressed the c-Myc-Bmi1 signalling pathway, and overexpression of Bmi1 reversed the effects of Huaier n-butanol extract on GC cells. Thus, our findings indicate that Huaier n-butanol extract suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of GC cells via a c-Myc-Bmi1-mediated approach, providing a new perspective for our understanding of the anti-tumour effects of Huaier. These results suggest that Huaier n-butanol extract could be an attractive therapeutic adjuvant for the treatment of human GC. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

In the present study, we screened the anticancer potential of supernatant metabolites from eight native haloarchaeal strains obtained from a culture collection in Iran. Five human cancer cell lines including breast, lung, prostate and also human fibroblast cells as the normal control were used in the present study. Moreover, to evaluate the anti-tumor effect of the selected supernatant, inhibition of sphere formation and tumor development was assessed in-vitro and in-vivo, respectively. Among all strains, supernatant metabolites from Halobacterium salinarum IBRC M10715 had the most potent cytotoxic effect on prostate cancer cell lines (IC50 = 0.5 mg/mL) without any effects on normal cells. It significantly increased both early and late apoptosis (about 11% and 9%, respectively) in the androgen-dependent PC3 cell line, reduced sphere formation ability of DU145 and PC3 cells with down-regulation of SOX2 gene expression. Furthermore, our results revealed that tumors developed in nude mice significantly shrank post intratumor injection of metabolites of the haloarchaeal strain. In conclusion, we suggested here for the first time that supernatant metabolites from Halobacterium salinarum IBRC M10715 could be a novel component against prostate cancer in-vitro and in-vivo with remarkable reduction in stem-like properties of tumor. © 2018, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

The main HNSCC risk factors are tobacco, excessive alcohol use, and the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV positive (+) cancers are etiologically different from other HNSCC and often show better prognosis. The current knowledge regarding HNSCC miRNA profiles is still incomplete especially in the context of HPV+ cancer. Thus, we analyzed 61 freshly collected primary oral (OSCC) and oropharyngeal (OPSCC) SCC samples. HPV DNA and RNA was found in 21% cases. The Illumina whole-genome small-RNA profiling by next-generation sequencing was done on 22 samples and revealed 7 specific miRNAs to HPV+ OSCC, 77 to HPV+ OPSCC, and additional 3 shared with both; 51 miRNAs were specific to HPV− OPSCC, 62 to HPV− OSCC, and 31 shared with both. The results for 9 miRNAs (miR-9, -21, -29a, -100, -106b, -143 and -145) were assessed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction on the whole study population. The data was additionally confirmed by reanalyzing publicly available miRNA sequencing Cancer Genome Atlas consortium (TCGA) HNSCC data. Cell signaling pathway analysis revealed differences between HPV+ and HPV− HNSCC. Our findings compared with literature data revealed extensive heterogeneity of miRNA deregulation with only several miRNAs consistently affected, and miR-9 being the most likely HPV related miRNA. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Development of combined therapies constitutes an effective strategy to inhibit cancer cells and prevent the emergence of drug resistance. For this purpose, we investigated the anti-tumoral effect of thirteen phenolic compounds, from the Tunisian quince Cydonia oblonga Miller, alone or combined to 5-FU, on the human 5-FU-resistant LS174-R colon cancer cells in comparison to parental cells. Our results showed that only Kaempferol was able to chemo-sensitize 5-FU-resistant LS174-R cells. This phenolic compound combined with 5-FU exerted synergistic inhibitory effect on cell viability. This combination enhanced the apoptosis and induced cell cycle arrest of both chemo-resistant and sensitive cells through impacting the expression levels of different cellular effectors. Kaempferol also blocked the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and modulated the expression of JAK/STAT3, MAPK, PI3K/AKT and NF-κB. In silico docking analysis suggested that the potent anti-tumoral effect of Kaempferol, compared to its two analogs (Kaempferol 3-O-glucoside and Kampferol 3-O-rutinoside), can be explained by the absence of glucosyl groups. Overall, our data propose Kaempferol as a potential chemotherapeutic agent to be used alone or in combination with 5-FU to overcome colon cancer drug resistance. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Considering the high prevalence and mortality rate of colorectal cancer, in this study we tried to design and validate a standard printed form and evaluate oncologists’ and nurses’ adherence to this form. This cross-sectional study was performed in Omid hospital, Mashhad, Iran from January 2015 to October 2015. A Chemotherapy form including various demographic and clinical parameters and approved chemotherapy regimens for colorectal cancer was designed by the clinical pharmacist and validated by clinical oncologists working in this center. All eligible patients admitted in this center during this period of time were included in the study. Adherence of the oncologists and nurses to this form and probable medication errors were identified by the pharmacy student. Sixty-seven patients with colorectal cancer and a total of 251 chemotherapy courses were evaluated. All patients received regimens compatible with developed form but in 206 courses (98.56%) of chemotherapy dosing error happened and in most of cases patients received lower than calculated dose (37.8%). Three errors occurred in administration step by nurses which they infused the medication in shorter than recommended duration. In general, oncologists’ adherence with developed form for chemotherapy of colorectal cancer was relatively high, except in dose calculation. Avoiding from rounding the calculated medications’ doses and precise calculation of patients’ body surface area can prevent most of medication errors and reduce risk of adverse drug reaction occurrence. © 2018, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

Nevertheless, the importance of transfusion timing is still unclear. The primary purpose of this study is to appraise whether the receipt of intraoperative blood transfusion (BT) differ from postoperative BT in regards to cancer outcomes in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients treated with nephrectomy. Data on 1168 patients with RCC, who underwent radical or partial nephrectomy as primary therapy between 1988–2013 were analyzed. PBT was defined as transfusion of allogeneic red blood cells (RBC) during surgery or the postsurgical period. Survival was analyzed and compared using the Kaplan–Meier method with the log-rank test. Of 1168 patients, 198 patients (16.9%) received a PBT. Including 117 intraoperative BT and 81 postoperative BT. Only 21 (10.6%) patients required both intraoperative and postoperative BT. On multivariate analyses, receipt of PBT was associated with significantly worse local disease recurrence (HR: 2.4; P = 0.017), metastatic progression (HR: 2.7; P = 0.005), cancer-specific mortality (HR: 3.5; P = 0.002) and all-cause mortality (HR: 2.1; P = 0.005). Nevertheless, postoperative BT was not independently associated with increased risk of local recurrence (p = 0.1), metastatic progression (P = 0.16) or kidney cancer death (P = 0.63), yet did significantly increase the risk of overall mortality (HR: 2.6; P = 0.004).

For this reason novel therapies accounting for PDAC peculiarities, such as the relevant stromal reaction, are urgently needed. Here adipose mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (AD-MSC) have been armed to constantly release a soluble trimeric and multimeric variant of the known anti-cancer TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (sTRAIL). This cancer gene therapy strategy was in vitro challenged demonstrating that sTRAIL was thermally stable and able to induce apoptosis in the PDAC lines BxPC-3, MIA PaCa-2 and against primary PDAC cells. sTRAIL released by AD-MSC relocated into the tumor stroma was able to significantly counteract tumor growth in vivo with a significant reduction in tumor size, in cytokeratin-7+ cells and by an anti-angiogenic effect. In parallel, histology on PDAC specimens form patients (n = 19) was performed to investigate the levels of TRAIL DR4, DR5 and OPG receptors generating promising insights on the possible clinical translation of our approach. These results indicate that adipose MSC can very efficiently vehicle a novel TRAIL variant opening unexplored opportunities for PDAC treatment. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Malignant melanoma is one of the untreatable cancers in which conventional therapeutic strategies, including chemotherapy, are hardly effective. Therefore, identification of novel therapeutic targets involved in melanoma progression is urgently needed for developing effective therapeutic methods. Overexpression of interleukin-13 receptor α2 (IL13Rα2) is observed in several cancer types including glioma and pancreatic cancer. Although IL13Rα2 is implicated in the progression of various types of cancer, its expression and roles in the malignant melanoma have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we showed that IL13Rα2 was expressed in approximately 7.5% melanoma patients. While IL13Rα2 expression in human melanoma cells decreased their proliferation in vitro, it promoted in vivo tumour growth and angiogenesis in melanoma xenograft mouse model. We also found that the expression of amphiregulin, a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, was correlated with IL13Rα2 expression in cultured melanoma cells, xenograft tumour tissues and melanoma clinical samples. Furthermore, expression of amphiregulin promoted tumour growth, implicating causal relationship between the expression of IL13Rα2 and amphiregulin. These results suggest that IL13Rα2 enhances tumorigenicity by inducing angiogenesis in malignant melanoma, and serves as a potential therapeutic target of malignant melanoma. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

However, its prognostic value and the underlying mechanism in lung cancer remains unclear. Herein we evaluated the expression of PKD2 in lung adenocarcinoma and investigated its relationship with EMT. GSEA, TCGA and K-M plotter database were applied and revealed that high PKD2 expression predicted poor outcome and related with lymph nodes metastasis in lung cancer. IHC and qRT-PCR were performed and found PKD2 was elevated in lung adenocarcinoma and negatively related with OS (p = 0.015), PFS (p = 0.006) and the level of E-cadherin (p = 0.021). Experiment in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines demonstrated up-regulation of PKD2 led to high expression of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vim, mmp9 et al.) and EMT transcription factors(zeb1, twist, snail), and the results were reversed when PKD2 was knocked down. Further investigation showed that abrogation of PKD2 inhibited A549 cell migration, invasion, proliferation and induced cell arrest in G2/M phase. We concluded that high expression of PKD2 was associated with poor prognosis and cancer progression in lung adenocarcinoma patients by promoting EMT. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

We showed for the first time that Raman imaging can be used to distinguish successfully between glycosylated and nonglycosylated proteins in normal and cancer tissue. Thousands of protein, lipid and glycan species exist in cells and tissues and their metabolism is monitored via numerous pathways, networks and methods. The metabolism can change in response to cellular environment alterations, such as development of a disease. Measuring such alterations and understanding the pathways involved are crucial to fully understand cellular metabolism in cancer development. In this paper Raman markers of glycogen, glycosaminoglycan, chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate proteoglycan were identified based on their vibrational signatures. High spatial resolution of Raman imaging combined with chemometrics allows separation of individual species from many chemical components present in each cell. We have found that metabolism of proteins, lipids and glycans is markedly deregulated in breast (adenocarcinoma) and brain (medulloblastoma) tumors. We have identified two glycoforms in the normal breast tissue and the malignant brain tissue in contrast to the breast cancer tissue where only one glycoform has been identified. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Very recently, we postulated that the incorporation of citral into nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC-Citral) improves solubility and delivery of the citral without toxic effects in vivo. Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate anti-cancer effects of NLC-Citral in MDA MB-231 cells in vitro through the Annexin V, cell cycle, JC-1 and fluorometric assays. Additionally, this study is aimed to effects of NLC-Citral in reducing the tumor weight and size in 4T1 induced murine breast cancer model. Results showed that NLC-Citral induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest in MDA MB-231 cells. Furthermore, a prominent anti-metastatic ability of NLC-Citral was demonstrated in vitro using scratch, migration and invasion assays. A significant reduction of migrated and invaded cells was observed in the NLC-Citral treated MDA MB-231 cells. To further evaluate the apoptotic and anti-metastatic mechanism of NLC-Citral at the molecular level, microarray-based gene expression and proteomic profiling were conducted. Based on the result obtained, NLC-Citral was found to regulate several important signaling pathways related to cancer development such as apoptosis, cell cycle, and metastasis signaling pathways. Additionally, gene expression analysis was validated through the targeted RNA sequencing and real-time polymerase chain reaction. In conclusion, the NLC-Citral inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells in vitro, majorly through the induction of apoptosis, anti-metastasis, anti-angiogenesis potentials, and reducing the tumor weight and size without altering the therapeutic effects of citral. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The incidence of developing cancer should increase with the body mass, yet is not the case, a conundrum referred to as Peto’s paradox. Elephants have a lower incidence of cancer suggesting that these animals have probably evolved different ways to protect themselves against the disease. The paradox is worth revisiting with the realization that most mammals encode an endogenous APOBEC3 cytidine deaminase capable of mutating single stranded DNA. Indeed, the mutagenic activity of some APOBEC3 enzymes has been shown to introduce somatic mutations into genomic DNA. These enzymes are now recognized as causal agent responsible for the accumulation of CG- > TA transitions and DNA breaks leading to chromosomal rearrangements in human cancer genomes. Here, we identified an elephant A3Z1 gene, related to human APOBEC3A and showed that it could efficiently deaminate cytidine, 5-methylcytidine and produce DNA breaks leading to massive apoptosis, similar to other mammalian APOBEC3A enzymes where body mass varies by up to four orders of magnitude. Consequently, it could be considered that eAZ1 might contribute to cancer in elephants in a manner similar to their proposed role in humans. If so, eAZ1 might be particularly well regulated to counter Peto’s paradox. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

The cells and mitochondria were isolated from cancerous and non-cancerous ovarian tissues and exposed to IC 50 concentration of F1 fraction for evaluation of mitochondrial and cellular parameters. Our results showed that F1 fraction of T. coronatus crude extract significantly induced toxic effects only in the cancerous ovarian mitochondria, including increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, mitochondrial swelling, and cytochrome c release.Flow-cytometry analysis demonstrated that F1 fraction of T. coronatus progressively induced apoptosis and necrosis only on EOC but not non-cancerous cells.

Biotin-PEG-PCL polymers have been used for targeted drug delivery to cancer, as well as to improve the pharmacokinetics of the drug and reduce its effects. In this study, biotin-conjugated copolymers were fabricated with polymerization of the ring opening method and the properties of copolymer and nanoparticles were investigated using various techniques. The toxicity of artemisinin and its nanoparticles have been investigated on MCF-7 and normal HFF2 cells. The results showed that the encapsulation efficacy of artemisinin in nanoparticles was 45.5 ± 0.41%. The release profile of the drug indicates that the release is slow and controlled and is approximately pH dependent. The results of artemisinin cell culture on human breast cancer cells showed that biotin-PEG-PCL nanoparticles had an inhibitory effect on MCF-7 cells and had no toxic effects on HFF2 cells. Anticancer activity in vivo in the 4T1 breast cancer model showed that tumour volumes were decreased up 40 mm3 by ART-loaded micelles and 76 mm3 by free ART, compared to the control group (2150 mm). In vivo results showed that this formulation significantly increases the accumulation of substances in the tumours. Therefore, the molecular formulation of ART-based copolymers can be a desirable process for cancer treatment purposes. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group." ;

Previous reports have shown the effectiveness of BP in treating cancer diseases. However, BP has no targeting capacity towards specific cancer cells. To improve treatment efficiency and reduce the dose of BP used in cancer treatment, targeting-based approaches should be developed. In the present study, we used riboflavin-5′-phosphate (RFMP) immobilized iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4 MNPs) as carriers for BP to treat cancer cell lines derived from liver, prostate and breast. These model cancer cells overexpress riboflavin receptors on their cell membrane and are also sensitive to BP treatment. Thus, BP-binding free RFMP on MNPs can be used as probes to target these model cells, whereas BP can be readily released on target cancer cells. Cell viability was twofold lower by using Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs immobilized with BP than that achieved by using free-form BP at a similar amount. Moreover, BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs have no apparent harmful effects on non-target cells. In addition, we evaluated the level of cysteine-aspartic acid protease 3 (caspase 3) in the resultant cell lysate obtained after treatment by BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs to demonstrate that apoptosis is mainly involved in the growth inhibition of target cells. © 2017, © 2017 The Author(s).

Patients with laryngeal cancer (ICD-10: C32) between 2009 and 2010 were retrospectively identified and tracked until 2015 using the Korean Health Insurance claims database. During the seven-year follow-up period, 5,322 subjects were newly diagnosed with larynx cancer. The mean age of people with laryngeal cancer was much higher than those without (63.29 vs. 47.7 years, p < 0.0001), and the incidence of larynx cancer in men was much higher than that in women (93.16% vs. 6.84%, p < 0.0001). Age, gender, smoking status, alcohol intake, and exercise-adjusted hazard ratios indicated that participants with MetS had a 1.13-fold higher hazard of having larynx cancer than those without MetS. The number of MetS components was a strong risk factor for laryngeal cancer with a higher risk estimate of this cancer in both ex- and current smokers as well as people who have never smoked. MetS was found to be an independent risk factor for the incidence of laryngeal cancer.

        fabio:abstract    "Chromosome changes are one of the hallmarks of human malignancies. Chromosomal rearrangement is frequent in human cancers. One of the consequences of chromosomal rearrangement is gene fusions in the cancer genome. We have previously identified a panel of fusion genes in aggressive prostate cancers. In this study, we showed that 6 of these fusion genes are present in 7 different types of human malignancies with variable frequencies. Among them, the CCNH-C5orf30 and TRMT11-GRIK2 gene fusions were found in breast cancer, colon cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, ovarian cancer and liver cancer, with frequencies ranging from 12.9% to 85%. In contrast, four other gene fusions (mTOR-TP53BP1, TMEM135-CCDC67, KDM4-AC011523.2 and LRRC59-FLJ60017) are less frequent. Both TRMT11-GRIK2 and CCNH-C5orf30 are also frequently present in lymph node metastatic cancer samples from the breast, colon and ovary. Thus, detecting these fusion transcripts may have significant biological and clinical implications in cancer patient management. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Quantifying the genetic correlation between cancers can provide important insights into the mechanisms driving cancer etiology. Using genome-wide association study summary statistics across six cancer types based on a total of 296,215 cases and 301,319 controls of European ancestry, here we estimate the pair-wise genetic correlations between breast, colorectal, head/neck, lung, ovary and prostate cancer, and between cancers and 38 other diseases. We observed statistically significant genetic correlations between lung and head/neck cancer (r g = 0.57, p = 4.6 × 10 −8 ), breast and ovarian cancer (r g = 0.24, p = 7 × 10 −5 ), breast and lung cancer (r g = 0.18, p =1.5 × 10 −6 ) and breast and colorectal cancer (r g = 0.15, p = 1.1 × 10 −4 ). We also found that multiple cancers are genetically correlated with non-cancer traits including smoking, psychiatric diseases and metabolic characteristics.

        fabio:abstract    "Purpose: Several previous studies have shown that oral bisphosphonates (BPs) are associated with the incidence of 13 specific cancers, including lung cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the findings are heterogeneous. Methods and results: Relevant studies published in databases such as PubMed, Embase database, and Cochrane library were systematically retrieved from inception to August 25th, 2017, regardless of language, by two investigators independently. Afterwards, the maximum adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted from the retrieved studies. Finally, 13 cohort studies involving 1,510,763 participants were enrolled into this meta-analysis. No significant relationship was found between oral BPs and the risk of all-cause cancer in osteoporosis (OP) patients among the entire population (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80–1.18; I 2 92.5%). Besides, oral BPs could remarkably reduce the incidence of breast cancer (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68–0.92; I 2 54%) and endometrial cancer (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64–0.96; I 2 0%) in postmenopausal OP females. In addition, oral BPs were also found to evidently reduce the incidence of upper gastrointestinal cancer in OP patients among the entire population (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54–0.98; I 2 36.1%). However, oral BPs may lead to increased risk of liver cancer in mixed genders (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.03–2.77; I 2 30.7%). Conclusions: Taken together, oral BPs do not increase the risk of incidence of all-cause cancer; instead, they can reduce the incidence of breast, endometrial, and upper gastrointestinal cancers among the postmenopausal OP females. Our analysis stratified by gender suggests that oral BPs may increase the incidence of liver cancer in mixed genders, while no significant association was observed in females. Careful analysis of post-marketing data should be conducted to address the clinical relevance of our results on the putative association of oral BP use and liver cancer suggested by our meta-analysis. © 2017, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation." ;

However, it remains unclear how cancer cells migrate in the three-dimensional (3D) matrix of cancer tissues and how CAFs support the cancer invasion. Here we propose a novel mechanism of fibroblast-dependent cancer cell invasion in the 3D collagen matrix. Human cancer cell lines from the pancreas (Panc-1), lung (A549) and some other organs actively adhered to normal fibroblasts and primary lung CAFs in cultures. To show its significance in tumor invasion, we designed a new invasion assay in which homogeneous microspheroids consisting of cancer cells and fibroblasts were embedded into collagen gel. Time-lapse experiments showed that cancer cells adhered to and quickly migrated on the long protrusions of fibroblasts in the 3D collagen matrix. Fibroblast-free cancer cells poorly invaded the matrix. Experiments with function-blocking antibodies, siRNAs, and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that cancer cells adhered to fibroblasts through integrin α5β1-mediated binding to fibronectin on the surface of fibroblasts. Immunochemical analyses of the co-cultures and lung cancers suggested that cancer cells could acquire the migratory force by the fibronectin/integrin signaling. Our results also revealed that the fibroblast-bound fibronectin was a preferential substrate for cancer cells to migrate in the collagen matrix. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

However, very few studies investigated the role of integrin α3 (ITGα3) in malignant cancers. Here, we determined the functional role of ITGα3 in pancreatic cancer. Analysis of public microarray databases and Western blot analysis indicated a unique expression of ITGα3 in human pancreatic cancer. Silencing ITGα3 expression significantly inhibited the viability and migration of human pancreatic cancer cells. Notably, ablation of ITGα3 expression resulted in a significant decrease of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression compared with transfection of control-siRNA through an increased number of leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domain protein 1 (LRIG1) expression. In addition, ablating ITGα3 inhibited tumour growth via blockade of EGFR signalling in vivo. Furthermore, the highly expressed ITGα3 led to a poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. Our results provide novel insights into ITGα3-induced aggressive pancreatic cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Since epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in promoting metastasis of cancer, many mechanisms regarding EMT have been studied. We previously showed that Ribonucleic acid export 1 (RAE1) is dysregulated in breast cancer and its overexpression leads to aggressive breast cancer phenotypes by inducing EMT. Here, we evaluated the functional capacity of RAE1 in breast cancer metastasis by using a three-dimensional (3D) culture system and xenograft models. Furthermore, to investigate the mechanisms of RAE1-driven EMT, in vitro studies were carried out. The induction of EMT with RAE1-overexpression was confirmed under the 3D culture system and in vivo system. Importantly, RAE1 mediates upregulation of an EMT marker ZEB1, by binding to the promoter region of ZEB1. Knockdown of ZEB1 in RAE1-overexpressing cells suppressed invasive and migratory behaviors, accompanied by an increase in epithelial and a decrease in mesenchymal markers. Taken together, these data demonstrate that RAE1 contributes to breast cancer metastasis by regulating a key EMT-inducing factor ZEB1 expression, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Obesity is a risk factor for many cancers including breast, esophageal, colon, and thyroid cancer. We aimed to evaluate the association of thyroid cancer with body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and weight change. This nationwide population-based cohort study included 11,323,006 adults who joined the national health screening program. Weight change was defined as the difference between the weight of the subjects measured during the study period and the weight at the time of four years ago. For evaluating the association between the weight change and the risk of thyroid cancer, subjects without weight change for four years were defined as the reference group. Mean age was 50.1 ± 13.7 years and 44% were female. In total, 50,464 subjects (0.4%) had newly-diagnosed thyroid cancer. After multivariable analyses, the incidence of thyroid cancer increased significantly in subjects with larger WC as well as higher BMI (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). In subjects who were lean and became obese, the incidence of thyroid cancers increased significantly (hazard ratio [HR] 1.15 [1.11–1.19]). In subjects who were obese and became lean, the incidence of thyroid cancers decreased significantly (HR 0.89 [0.86–0.93]). These results demonstrated that higher BMI and larger WC were significantly associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer. Weight gain in lean subjects was associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer, and weight reduction in subjects with obesity was associated with a decreased risk of thyroid cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

In order to understand this increase, country specific dietary exposures have been investigated. The aim of this study was to quantify the association between consumption of brown cheese, a common bread topping in Norway, and colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer in the prospective Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) Study. Data on brown cheese consumption and adjustment factors was available for 82 527 women. During a mean of 14.6 years of follow-up (1.2 million person-years), there were 1360 cases of colorectal cancer (907 colon; 453 rectal). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer sites. We modelled restricted cubic splines with 4 knots, to assess a possible non-linear relationship between brown cheese intake and the investigated cancer sites. In the age-adjusted model, consumption of more than 2 slices (>16 grams) of brown cheese per day was associated with 13% reduced risk of colon cancer (95% CI 4%-21%) compared to women who did not consume brown cheese. The multivariable-adjusted model, however, showed no association between brown cheese consumption and the risk of colorectal, colon, or rectal cancer (colorectal: HR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.76–1.13, p-trend 0.37; colon: HR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.65–1.06; p-trend = 0.10; rectal: HR = 1.16, 95% CI 0.84–1.1.61, p-trend = 0.41). In this large, prospective cohort study of women, consumption of brown cheese was suggestively protective against colon cancer. However, adjustment attenuated the inverse risk association. Brown cheese consumption was not associated with rectal cancer, or colorectal cancer overall. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Current cancer diagnosis utilizes histopathology, which requires tissue acquisition, extensive processing and, in most cases, relies on the qualitative morphological analysis of tissues and cells. Molecular biomarkers are only available for a few specific tumor subtypes. We discovered that the fluorescence polarization (Fpol) of Methylene Blue (MB) is significantly higher in cancer than in normal human breast tissues and cells. We confirmed that fluorescence polarization imaging did not affect the viability of the cells and yielded highly significant differences between cancer and normal cells using MB concentrations as low as 0.05 and 0.01 mg/ml. To explain this phenomenon we examined intracellular localization of MB and its fluorescence lifetime. We determined that higher fluorescence polarization of MB occurs due to its increased accumulation in mitochondria of cancer cells, as well as shorter fluorescence lifetime in cancer relative to normal cells. As quantitative MB Fpol imaging can be performed in vivo and in real time, it holds the potential to provide an accurate quantitative marker of cancer at the cellular level. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

The anticancer polymers are designed to target anionic lipids exposed on the cancer cell surfaces and act by disrupting the cancer cell membranes. Because the polymer mechanism is not dependent on cell proliferation, we hypothesized that the polymers were active against dormant cancer cells. The polymers exhibited cytotoxicity to proliferating prostate cancer. Importantly, the polymer killed dormant prostate cancer cells that were resistant to docetaxel. This study demonstrates a new approach to discover novel anticancer therapeutics. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

We developed a novel computational platform applying a multi-modal approach to filter out passengers and more robustly identify putative driver genes. The primary filter identifies enrichment of cancer mutations in CATH functional families (CATH-FunFams) – structurally and functionally coherent sets of evolutionary related domains. Using structural representatives from CATH-FunFams, we subsequently seek enrichment of mutations in 3D and show that these mutation clusters have a very significant tendency to lie close to known functional sites or conserved sites predicted using CATH-FunFams. Our third filter identifies enrichment of putative driver genes in functionally coherent protein network modules confirmed by literature analysis to be cancer associated. Our approach is complementary to other domain enrichment approaches exploiting Pfam families, but benefits from more functionally coherent groupings of domains. Using a set of mutations from 22 cancers we detect 151 putative cancer drivers, of which 79 are not listed in cancer resources and include recently validated cancer associated genes EPHA7, DCC netrin-1 receptor and zinc-finger protein ZNF479. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Cox proportional hazards models were used. Males and females classified as obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg /m −2 ) have a 33% and 22% increased risk of all-cancer, respectively, than their normal weight counterparts. Similar all-cancer risk increases are observed for those above sex-specific WC guidelines.

Collectively, 86.3% (63/73) of HAMPs have recurrent alterations in at least 1 cancer type and 16 HAMPs, including 9 understudied HAMPs, are identified as putative therapeutic targets across multiple cancer types. For example, the recurrent focal amplification of BRD9 is observed in 9 cancer types and genetic depletion of BRD9 inhibits tumor growth.

        fabio:abstract    "The current system for evaluating prostate cancer architecture is the Gleason grading system which divides the morphology of cancer into five distinct architectural patterns, labeled 1 to 5 in increasing levels of cancer aggressiveness, and generates a score by summing the labels of the two most dominant patterns. The Gleason score is currently the most powerful prognostic predictor of patient outcomes; however, it suffers from problems in reproducibility and consistency due to the high intra-observer and inter-observer variability amongst pathologists. In addition, the Gleason system lacks the granularity to address potentially prognostic architectural features beyond Gleason patterns. We evaluate prostate cancer for architectural subtypes using techniques from topological data analysis applied to prostate cancer glandular architecture. In this work we demonstrate the use of persistent homology to capture architectural features independently of Gleason patterns. Specifically, using persistent homology, we compute topological representations of purely graded prostate cancer histopathology images of Gleason patterns 3,4 and 5, and show that persistent homology is capable of clustering prostate cancer histology into architectural groups through a ranked persistence vector. Our results indicate the ability of persistent homology to cluster prostate cancer histopathology images into unique groups with dominant architectural patterns consistent with the continuum of Gleason patterns. In addition, of particular interest, is the sensitivity of persistent homology to identify specific sub-architectural groups within single Gleason patterns, suggesting that persistent homology could represent a robust quantification method for prostate cancer architecture with higher granularity than the existing semi-quantitative measures. The capability of these topological representations to segregate prostate cancer by architecture makes them an ideal candidate for use as inputs to future machine learning approaches with the intent of augmenting traditional approaches with topological features for improved diagnosis and prognosis. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Accumulative studies demonstrate that UHRF1 is broadly overexpressed in cancers, which contributes to cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Interestingly, a proteasome-dependent downregulation of UHRF1 has been observed in pluripotent ground state mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) cultured in the presence of two kinase (MEK1/MEK2 and GSK3β) inhibitors (termed 2i), raising the question whether UHRF1 is similarly regulated in cancer cells. Here we present evidence that while addition of 2i broadly downregulates UHRF1 and DNMT1 in various cancer cells, distinct underlying mechanisms are involved. In contrast to mESCs, 2i-induced downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in cancer cells cannot be rescued by proteasome inhibitor and occurs primarily at the level of transcription. Furthermore, downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 by 2i is due to inhibition of MEK1/MEK2, but not GSK3β activity. Data mining reveals a marked co-expression of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in normal tissues as well as cancers. We provide evidence that multiple transcription factors including E2F1 and SP1 mediate the transcriptional activation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 by the activated MEK/ERK pathway. Together our study reveals distinct regulation of UHRF1/DNMT1 in mESCs and cancer cells and identifies activated MEK/ERK pathway as a driving force for coordinated and aberrant over-expression of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in cancers. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

When it is applied to cancer cells, solid stress hinders their proliferation rate and promotes cancer cell invasion and metastatic potential.

Here, we used two pancreatic cancer cell lines and an established in vitro system to study the effect of solid stress-induced signal transduction on pancreatic cancer cell migration as well as the mechanism involved. Our results show that the migratory ability of cells increases as a direct response to solid stress. We also found that Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) expression and secretion is strongly upregulated in pancreatic cancer cells in response to mechanical compression. Performing a phosphoprotein screening, we identified that solid stress activates the Akt/CREB1 pathway to transcriptionally regulate GDF15 expression, which eventually promotes pancreatic cancer cell migration. Our results suggest a novel solid stress signal transduction mechanism bringing GDF15 to the centre of pancreatic tumor biology and rendering it a potential target for future anti-metastatic therapeutic innovations. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a cancer treatment that make use of the cancer-specific accumulation of porphyrins. We have reported that mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mitROS) upregulate uptake transporter of porphyrins, heme carrier protein-1 (HCP-1). The accumulation of cancer-specific porphyrins was increased by mitROS production, thereby the cancer-specific PDT cytotoxicity was enhanced. Thus we investigated whether mitROS production by hyperthermia can enhanced the cytotoxicity of PDT or not. In this study, 1 h of hyperthermia at 42 °C increased the mitROS production, and both the accumulation of cancer-specific porphyrins and the PDT cytotoxicity increased. Moreover, the authors treated cells with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) to examine the effect of mitROS. NAC inhibited the increasing ROS production after hyperthermia to restrain the post-treatment increase of cancer-specific porphyrins accumulation. Moreover, the increase of ROS production in cancer cells after hyperthermia upregulated HCP-1 expression and downregulated ABCG2 expression. These regulation were inhibited by NAC. These results suggest that hyperthermia treatment increased mitROS production, which involved HpD accumulation and enhanced PDT effects in cancer cells. The mechanism of this phenomenon was most likely to be due to both the upregulation of HCP-1 and the downregulation of ABCG2 by mitROS. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Recent studies showed that changes to the gut microbiome alters the microbiome-derived metabolome, potentially promoting carcinogenesis in organs that are distal to the gut. In this study, we assessed the relationship between breast cancer and cadaverine biosynthesis. Cadaverine treatment of Balb/c female mice (500 nmol/kg p.o. q.d.) grafted with 4T1 breast cancer cells ameliorated the disease (lower mass and infiltration of the primary tumor, fewer metastases, and lower grade tumors). Cadaverine treatment of breast cancer cell lines corresponding to its serum reference range (100–800 nM) reverted endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, inhibited cellular movement and invasion, moreover, rendered cells less stem cell-like through reducing mitochondrial oxidation. Trace amino acid receptors (TAARs), namely, TAAR1, TAAR8 and TAAR9 were instrumental in provoking the cadaverine-evoked effects. Early stage breast cancer patients, versus control women, had reduced abundance of the CadA and LdcC genes in fecal DNA, both responsible for bacterial cadaverine production. Moreover, we found low protein expression of E. coli LdcC in the feces of stage 1 breast cancer patients. In addition, higher expression of lysine decarboxylase resulted in a prolonged survival among early-stage breast cancer patients. Taken together, cadaverine production seems to be a regulator of early breast cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

The specific function of CBX6 in breast cancer is currently undefined. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset led to the identification of CBX6 as a consistently downregulated gene in breast cancer. We provided evidence showing enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) negatively regulated CBX6 expression in a Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)-dependent manner. Exogenous overexpression of CBX6 inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation, and induced cell cycle arrest along with suppression of migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro. Microarray analyses revealed that CBX6 governs a complex gene expression program. Moreover, CBX6 induced significant downregulation of bone marrow stromal cell antigen-2 (BST2), a potential therapeutic target, via interactions with its promoter region. Our collective findings support a tumor suppressor role of CBX6 in breast cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "MRI plays important roles in endometrial and cervical cancer assessment, from detection to recurrent disease evaluation. Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common malignant tumor of the female genital tract in Western countries. EC patients are divided into risk categories based on histopathological tumor type, grade, and myometrial invasion depth. EC is surgically staged using the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) system. Since FIGO (2009) stage correlates with prognosis, preoperative staging is essential for tailored treatment. MRI reveals myometrial invasion depth, which correlates with tumor grade and lymph node metastases, and thus correlates with prognosis. Cervical cancer (CC) is the second most common cancer, and the third leading cause of cancer-related death among females in developing countries. The FIGO Gynecologic Oncology Committee recently revised its CC staging guidelines, allowing staging based on imaging and pathological findings when available. The revised FIGO (2017) staging includes node involvement and thus enables both therapy selection and evaluation, prognosis estimation, and calculation of end results. MRI can accurately assess prognostic indicators, e.g., tumor size, parametrial invasion, pelvic sidewall, and lymph node invasion. Despite these important roles of MRI, radiologists still face challenges due to the technical and interpretation pitfalls of MRI during all phases of endometrial and cervical cancer evaluation. Awareness of mimics that can simulate both cancers is critical. With careful application, functional MRI with DWI and DCE sequences can help establish a correct diagnosis, although it is sometimes necessary to perform biopsy and histopathological analysis. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

This led to the first biological based liquid biopsy test, which we called MATER-D platform. In the present study, we showed for the first time that a different type of OMCs (PTEN-deficient human epithelial MCF10A cells) turn malignant when exposed to cancer patient’s sera, confirming the concept that different cells with diverse oncosuppressor mutations can uptake cancer factors and be used in biological based liquid biopsy tests. Our observations were confirmed in a large variety of solid and haematological malignancies. This test was able to detect dysplasia and carcinomas in situ lesions in different organs and circulating factors in cancer patients years after the removal of their lesions. To our knowledge, this ability is unique and not shared by other liquid biopsy platforms. Immunohistochemistry analysis of the xenotransplants revealed identical patterns of differentiation regardless of the cancer type, showing that differentiation through horizontal transfer might be dependent on the nature of the target cells rather than the type of cancer factors. These data strengthen the notion that OMC-based liquid biopsy tests might be promising platforms for cancer screening. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Various studies have shown the significance of identifying drug targets for cancer, although this process continues challenging in the field of anti-cancer drug designing. The primary purpose of this study is to design a novel approach to identify target genes for cancer. The sub-network of colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancers were constructed from human protein–protein interaction network. The potential genes were analyzed using hubs and centrality measures. For the identification of target genes, we retrieve those genes that had the highest score in both mutation rates and graph centrality. Moreover, gene deletion analysis revealed that MYC, TP53, and EGFR genes remained potential targets in colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancer respectively. Results suggest that combining network measures with mutation frequencies in cancer genes might assist in recognizing several potential drug targets. Future enhancement of this current approach is to combine these network properties with the biological insights from gene expression data, and their functions will provide a reliable method for rational drug designing. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature." ;

Owing to enhanced permeability and retention in solid tumor tissue, nanoparticle (NP) delivery systems have been emerged as novel strategy in cancer chemotherapy. As extracellular matrix, glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) could bind its surface receptor adhesion molecule CD44 which is strongly expressed on breast cancer. We have previously reported a doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded HA-Lys-LA X-NPs (X-NP-DOX) NP delivery system for breast cancer treatment. In this study, we further investigated the antitumor effect of X-NP-DOX NP delivery system using low-dose DOX in both in vitro and in vivo systems. We demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX possessed the ability for inhibiting MCF-7 breast cancer cell growth, invasion, and migration, and inducing apoptosis in vitro. In in vivo experiments, injection of low-dose X-NP-DOX into tumor-bearing mouse resulted in significant reduction of tumor size. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining further revealed that low-dose X-NP-DOX induced higher percentage of apoptotic cells compared with free DOX or saline. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX inhibited Notch1 and Ras/MAPK pathways, decreased cancer stem cell population, and reduced tumorigenesis compared to free DOX in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Owing to its enhanced efficacy and higher targetability compared to free DOX, low-dose DOX delivered by NP system may be a promising novel strategy for breast cancer treatment." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Breast cancer survivors display altered inflammatory responses to immune challenges relative to cancer-naive controls likely due to previous cancer treatments, stress associated with cancer, and/or tumor physiology. Proper inflammatory responses are necessary for adaptive sickness behaviors (e.g., fatigue, anorexia, and fever) and neuroinflammatory pathways are also implicated in mental health disturbances (e.g., cognitive impairment, depression) suffered by cancer patients and survivors. Rodent cancer models indicate that tumors are sufficient to exacerbate neuroinflammatory responses after an immune challenge, however primary tumors are not usually present in cancer survivors, and the behavioral consequences of these brain changes remain understudied. Therefore, we tested the extent to which mammary tumor resection attenuates tumor-induced neuroinflammation and sickness behavior following an immune challenge (i.p. lipopolysaccharide [LPS] injection) in mice. Tnf-α, Il-1β, and Il-6 mRNA decreased in multiple brain regions of LPS-treated tumor-bearing mice relative to LPS-treated controls; tumor resection attenuated these effects in some cases (but not Tnf-α). Tumors also attenuated sickness behaviors (hypothermia and lethargy) compared to LPS-treated controls. Tumor resection reversed these behavioral consequences, although basal body temperature remained elevated, comparable to tumor-bearing mice. Thus, tumors significantly modulate neuroinflammatory pathways with functional consequences and tumor resection mitigates most, but not all, of these changes. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Natural compounds are a realistic source of new bioactive compounds with anticancer activity. Among them, rosemary polyphenols have shown a vast antiproliferative capacity against colon cancer cells in vitro and in animal models. We have investigated the antitumor activity of a rosemary extract (RE) obtained by using supercritical fluid extraction through its capacity to inhibit various signatures of cancer progression and metastasis such as proliferation, migration, invasion and clonogenic survival. RE strongly inhibited proliferation, migration and colony formation of colon cancer cells regardless their phenotype. Treatment with RE led to a sharp increase of intracellular ROS that resulted in necrosis cell death. Nrf2 gene silencing increased RE cytotoxic effects, thus suggesting that this pathway was involved in cell survival. These in vitro results were in line with a reduction of tumor growth by oral administration of RE in a xenograft model of colon cancer cells using athymic nude mice. These findings indicate that targeting colon cancer cells by increasing intracellular ROS and decreasing cell survival mechanisms may suppose a therapeutic option in colon cancer through the combination of rosemary compounds and chemotherapeutic drugs. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Although cure rates are high for early stage disease, clinical outcomes for advanced, metastatic, or recurrent disease remain poor. To change this panorama, a deeper understanding of cervical cancer biology and novel study models are needed. Immortalized human cancer cell lines such as HeLa constitute crucial scientific tools, but there are few other cervical cancer cell lines available, limiting our understanding of a disease known for its molecular heterogeneity. This study aimed to establish novel cervical cancer cell lines derived from Brazilian patients. We successfully established one (HCB-514) out of 35 cervical tumors biopsied. We confirmed the phenotype of HCB-514 by verifying its’ epithelial and tumor origin through cytokeratins, EpCAM and p16 staining. It was also HPV-16 positive. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) showed relevant somatic mutations in several genes including BRCA2, TGFBR1 and IRX2. A copy number variation (CNV) analysis by nanostring and WES revealed amplification of genes mainly related to kinases proteins involved in proliferation, migration and cell differentiation, such as EGFR, PIK3CA, and MAPK7. Overexpression of EGFR was confirmed by phospho RTK-array and validated by western blot analysis. Furthermore, the HCB-514 cell line was sensitive to cisplatin. In summary, this novel Brazilian cervical cancer cell line exhibits relevant key molecular features and constitutes a new biological model for pre-clinical studies. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Oncogene-induced replication stress (RS) promotes cancer development but also impedes tumor growth by activating anti-cancer barriers. To determine how cancer cells adapt to RS, we have monitored the expression of different components of the ATR-CHK1 pathway in primary tumor samples. We show that unlike upstream components of the pathway, the checkpoint mediators Claspin and Timeless are overexpressed in a coordinated manner. Remarkably, reducing the levels of Claspin and Timeless in HCT116 cells to pretumoral levels impeded fork progression without affecting checkpoint signaling. These data indicate that high level of Claspin and Timeless increase RS tolerance by protecting replication forks in cancer cells. Moreover, we report that primary fibroblasts adapt to oncogene-induced RS by spontaneously overexpressing Claspin and Timeless, independently of ATR signaling. Altogether, these data indicate that enhanced levels of Claspin and Timeless represent a gain of function that protects cancer cells from of oncogene-induced RS in a checkpoint-independent manner. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Turmeric, since in ancient Indian traditional medicinal system, has been implicated for its therapeutic and chemopreventive properties against a broad spectrum of diseases. Curcumin, the active polyphenol from turmeric, helps to obstruct the growth of many types of cancers at various stages which include prostrate, melanoma, breast, brain tumor, pancreatic, leukemia, etc. The initiation and recurrence of cancer have been attributed to few mutated cells in bulk of tumor called as cancer stem cells which have the capacity of self-renewal and differentiation. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3B) is a multifunctional serine/threonine protein kinase, originally found in mammals, an important component of diverse signaling pathways, dysregulation of which leads to affect the cancer stem cell properties. The nutritional- and phytochemical-based dietary interventions may complement current chemotherapy to prevent recurrence and relapse of cancer. The objective of present study is to investigate the effect of retinoic acid and curcumin–retinoic acid conjugates against GSK-3B protein. The in silico results indicate that molecule 3 (curcumin–retinoic acid conjugates) might be a potent inhibitor of GSK-3B and a novel future drug candidate for the treatment of cancer. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature." ;

        fabio:abstract    "In this study, we aimed to identify mutations of key genes associated with docetaxel resistance in nine endometrial cancer cell lines. Endometrial cancers are associated with several critical gene mutations, including PIK3A, PTEN, and KRAS. Different gene mutations in endometrial cancer cells have varied responses to anticancer drugs and cancer therapies. The most frequently altered gene in endometrioid endometrial carcinoma tumors is PTEN. PTEN protein has lipid phosphatase and protein phosphatase activity, as well as other functions in the nucleus. Although the tumor-suppressive function of PTEN has mainly been attributed to its lipid phosphatase activity, a role for PTEN protein phosphatase activity in cell cycle regulation has also been suggested. Various tumor type-specific PTEN mutations are well documented. Here, nine endometrioid endometrial cancer cell lines with PIK3A, PTEN, and KRAS gene mutations were treated with docetaxel and radiation. One mutation with a docetaxel drug-resistant effect was a truncated form of PTEN. Among PTEN mutations in endometrial cancer cells, the Y68 frame shift mutation of PTEN constitutes a major mechanism of resistance to docetaxel treatment. The molecular mechanism involves truncation of the 403 amino acid PTEN protein at amino acid 68 by the Y68 frame shift, leading to the loss of PTEN protein phosphatase and lipid phosphatase activities. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Hence to mimic such complex biological processes, an understanding of stimuli responsiveness is needed to sense specific changes and respond in a predictable manner. Such responses due to polymers may take place either simultaneously at the site or in a sequential manner from preparation to transporting pathways to cellular compartments. The present review comprehends the stimuli-responsive polymers and multi-responsiveness with respect to cancer therapy. It focuses on the exploitation of different stimuli like temperature, pH and enzymes responsiveness in a multi-stimuli setting. Nanogels and micelles being two of the most commonly used responsive polymeric carriers have also been discussed. The role of multiple stimuli delivery system is significant due to multiple changes happening in the near surroundings of cancer cells. These responsive materials are able to mimic some biological processes and recognize at the molecular level itself to manipulate development of custom-designed molecules for targeting cancer cells." ;

In contrast, antibodies to BLV were found in a very small percentage of healthy blood donors. There was no association between BLV DNA and other tumor prognostic biological markers such as hormonal receptors, HER2 oncoprotein, proliferation index, metastasis in sentinels lymph nodes, and tumor grade and size. Our findings suggest that BLV should be considered a potential predisposing factor to breast cancer in women. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Here we report that ovarian cancer cells manifest a spectrum of tumorigenic phenotypes upon knockdown of PIK3R1. PIK3R1 loss activates AKT and p110-independent JAK2/STAT3 signaling through inducing changes in the phosphorylation of the docking protein Gab2, thereby relieving the negative inhibition on AKT and promoting the assembly of JAK2/STAT3 signalosome, respectively. Additional mechanisms leading to AKT activation include enhanced p110α kinase activity and a decrease in PTEN level. PIK3R1 loss renders ovarian cancer cells vulnerable to inhibition of AKT or JAK2/STAT3. The combination of AKT and STAT3 inhibitors significantly increases the anti-tumor effect compared to single-agent treatments.

Finally, analysis of 214 prostate and 35 breast cancer genomes reveal that late-replicating regions are prone to cis and early-replication to trans chromosomal rearrangements.

        fabio:abstract    "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are promising therapies for haematological cancers. Historically, their therapeutic benefit is due to ADC targeting of lineage-restricted antigens. The C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is attractive for targeted therapy of haematological cancers, given its expression in multiple tumour types and role in cancer “homing” to bone marrow. However, CXCR4 is also expressed in haematopoietic cells and other normal tissues, raising safety challenges to the development of anti-CXCR4 ADCs for cancer treatment. Here, we designed the first anti-CXCR4 ADC with favourable therapeutic index, effective in xenografts of haematopoietic cancers resistant to standard of care and anti-CXCR4 antibodies. We screened multiple ADC configurations, by varying type of linker-payload, drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR), affinity and Fc format. The optimal ADC bears a non-cleavable linker, auristatin as payload at DAR = 4 and a low affinity antibody with effector–reduced Fc. Contrary to other drugs targeting CXCR4, anti-CXCR4 ADCs effectively eliminated cancer cells as monotherapy, while minimizing leucocytosis. The optimal ADC selectively eliminated CXCR4 + cancer cells in solid tumours, but showed limited toxicity to normal CXCR4 + tissues, sparing haematopoietic stem cells and progenitors. Our work provides proof-of-concept that through empirical ADC design, it is possible to target proteins with broad normal tissue expression. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Cancers in the bone produce a number of severe symptoms including pain that compromises patient functional status, quality of life, and survival. The source of this pain is multifaceted and includes factors secreted from tumor cells. Malignant cells release the neurotransmitter and cell-signaling molecule glutamate via the oxidative stress-related cystine/glutamate antiporter, system x C − , which reciprocally imports cystine for synthesis of glutathione and the cystine/cysteine redox cycle. Pharmacological inhibition of system x C − has shown success in reducing and delaying the onset of cancer pain-related behavior in mouse models. This investigation describes the development of a stable siRNA-induced knockdown of the functional trans-membrane system x C − subunit xCT (SLC7A11) in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Clones were verified for xCT knockdown at the transcript, protein, and functional levels. RNAseq was performed on a representative clone to comprehensively examine the transcriptional cellular signature in response to xCT knockdown, identifying multiple differentially regulated factors relevant to cancer pain including nerve growth factor, interleukin-1, and colony-stimulating factor-1. Mice were inoculated intrafemorally and recordings of pain-related behaviors including weight bearing, mechanical withdrawal, and limb use were performed. Animals implanted with xCT knockdown cancer cells displayed a delay until the onset of nociceptive behaviors relative to control cells. These results add to the body of evidence suggesting that a reduction in glutamate release from cancers in bone by inhibition of the system x C − transporter may decrease the severe and intractable pain associated with bone metastases. © The Author(s) 2017." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Background: The global cancer incidence and the number of survivors are increasing. Therefore, it is necessary to pay more attention to the side effects of treatment. Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of reflexology on the side effects of chemotherapy in cancer patients. Method: For finding the related articles, the researchers searched several databases including PubMed &ProQuest and valid websites including ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Scientific Information Database, and Magiran. The key terms of \"reflexology, cancer, and chemotherapy\" individually and combined together were searched in Parisian and English, and the studies performed from 2009 to 2017 were extracted. Due to the lack of sufficient studies carried out into the outcome of reflexology on chemotherapy, both Persian and English articles were used. Results: A total of 57 studies were extracted from the databases and valid websites; five of which met the inclusion criteria. All selected studies were clinical trials. Implications for Practice: Reflexology can be used as a non-pharmacologic nursing intervention to alleviate the side effects of chemotherapy and improve the quality of life of cancer patients. © 2017 Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

        fabio:abstract    "CD47 is a prominent new target in cancer immunotherapy, with antagonistic antibodies currently being evaluated in clinical trials. For effective evaluation of this strategy it is crucial to identify which patients are suited for CD47-targeted therapy. In this respect, expression of the pro-phagocytic signal SLAMF7 on both macrophages and cancer cells was recently reported to be a requisite for CD47 antibody-mediated phagocytosis. Here, we demonstrate that in fact SLAMF7 expression on cancer cells is not required and does not impact on CD47 antibody therapy. Moreover, SLAMF7 also does not impact on phagocytosis induction by CD20 antibody rituximab nor associates with overall survival of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma patients. In contrast, expression of CD47 negatively impacts on overall and progression free survival. In conclusion, cancer cell expression of SLAMF7 is not required for phagocytosis and, in contrast to CD47 expression, should not be used as selection criterion for CD47-targeted therapy. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Increased Crabp2 levels have been found in various types of cancer, and are associated with poor patients’ survival. Although Crabp2 is found to be overexpressed in lung cancer, its role in metastasis of lung cancer is unclear. In this study, Crabp2 was overexpressed in high-metastatic C10F4 than low-metastatic lung cancer cells. Analysis of clinical samples revealed that high CRABP2 levels were correlated with lymph node metastases, poor overall survival, and increased recurrence. Knockdown of Crabp2 decreased migration, invasion, anoikis resistance, and in vivo metastasis. Crabp2 was co-immunoprecipitated with HuR, and overexpression of Crabp2 increased HuR levels, which promoted integrin β1/FAK/ERK signaling. Inhibition of HuR or integrin β1/FAK/ERK signaling reversed the promoting effect of Crabp2 in migration, invasion, and anoikis resistance. Knockdown of Crabp2 further inhibited the growth of cancer cells as compared with that by gemcitabine or irinotecan alone. The expression of Crabp2 in human lung tumors was correlated with stress marker CHOP. In conclusion, our findings have identified the promoting role of Crabp2 in anoikis resistance and metastasis. CRABP2 may serve as a prognostic marker and targeting CRABP2 may be exploited as a modality to reduce metastasis. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "SPG-56 is a newly isolated glycoprotein from sweet potatoes (Zhongshu NO. 1), but its value for suppressing breast cancer progression remains unknown. This study was designed to investigate the potential anti-cancer effects of SPG-56, which consists of 2.9% sugar and 97.1% protein. The effects of SPG-56 on the proliferation and apoptosis of breast cancer cells were determined using CCK-8 and Hoechst 33342 assays and flow cytometry, after staining with Annexin V and PI respectively. The activities of SPG-56 against breast cancer were examined using female BALB/c nude mice orthotopically implanted with human breast carcinoma cells of the types MCF-7 and 4T1-Luc. The cellular experiments showed that SPG-56 inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of MCF-7 cells dose- and time-dependently. Oral administration of SPG-56 significantly suppressed the development of MCF-7 tumor cells (P < 0.01) as compared with an untreated group. The serum tumor markers CEA, CA125 and CA153 in a 240 mg/kg/d SPG-56 decreased by 54.8%, 91.8%, and 90.3%, respectively. The experiments further demonstrated that SPG-56 inhibited the metastasis of breast cancer in MCF-7 and 4T1-bearing mice by altering the expression of MMP2, MMP9, VEGF, Occludin and Claudin. It is concluded that SPG-56 may have potential as a novel anti-tumor candidate for breast cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Lymph node metastasis is of major prognostic significance for breast cancer. Lymph node metastasis arises at a very early stage in some patients. Using the data downloaded from the TCGA database, we studied the differences between primary tumors with and without lymph node metastasis at the multi-omics level using bioinformatics approaches. Our study found that low mutation and neoantigen burdens correlated with lymph node metastazation of breast cancer. All three conserved domains in TP53 were mutated in lymph node-negative breast cancers, whereas only one domain was mutated in lymph node-positive samples. Mutations in microtubule-related proteins appear to help immune cells recognize tumors and inhibit their lymph node metastasis. Destroying microtubule-related proteins is a potential therapeutic strategy to inhibit lymph node metastasis of breast cancer. As the neoantigens specifically present in lymph node-positive breast cancers, MAPK10, BC9L, TRIM65, CD93, KITLG, CNPPD1, CPED1, CCDC146, TMEM185A, INO80D, and PSMD11 are potential targets for vaccine design. In the tumor microenvironment, reduced numbers of effector immune cells, especially activated memory CD4+ T cells and activated mast cells, facilitate breast cancer metastasis to the lymph nodes. According to transcriptome data, lymph node metastasis was mostly driven by gene mutation rather than by gene expression. Although differential gene expression analysis was based on lymph node metastasis status, many genes were shown to be differentially expressed based on estrogen receptor status. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Fibroblasts turn into cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumour microenvironment. CAFs have recently attracted attention for their function as a regulator of immune cell recruitment and function in addition to their tumour-promoting roles. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of CAFs on monocyte recruitment and macrophage polarization in breast cancer. CAFs, which were α-SMA expressing fibroblasts in contrast to normal fibroblasts (NFs), effectively recruited monocytes. Recruitment of monocytes by CAFs might be mediated by monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) as well as stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) cytokines. CAFs differentiated the recruited monocytes into M2-like macrophages which are capable of exerting their immunosuppressive roles via the PD-1 axis. CAF-educated monocytes exhibited strong immune suppression unlike NF-educated monocytes and enhanced the motility/invasion of breast cancer cells in addition to increasing the expressions of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes and vimentin protein in cancer cells. CAF-educated M1 macrophages displayed increased expression of M2 markers and production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in contrast to decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12 compared with control M1 macrophages; suggesting that CAFs were also able to induce the trans-differentiation of M1 macrophages to M2 macrophages. We then investigated the relationship between the infiltration of CAFs and tumour associated macrophages (TAMs) using tissue samples obtained from breast cancer patients. High grade of CAFs significantly correlated with the number of TAMs in human breast cancer tissue samples. It was also associated with higher Ki-67 proliferation index, and higher tumour volume. This result is in line with our finding of increased breast cancer cell proliferation due to the effects of CAF-educated monocytes in vitro. Our results concluded that CAFs play pivotal roles in sculpturing the tumour microenvironment in breast cancer, and therapeutic strategies to reverse the CAF-mediated immunosuppressive microenvironment should be taken into consideration. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

We construct iCells of four cancers and the corresponding tissue controls and identify the most rewired genes in cancer.

We biologically validate that they have a role in cancer by knockdown experiments followed by cell viability assays.

We benchmarked Uniquorn 2 by cross-identifying 1612 RNA and 3596 panel-sized NGS profiles derived from 1516 CCLs, five repositories, four technologies and three major cancer panel-designs. Our method achieves an accuracy of 96% for RNA-seq and 95% for mixed DNA-seq and RNA-seq identification. Even for a panel of only 94 cancer-related genes, accuracy remains at 82% but decreases when using smaller panels.

The angular spectra of scattering coefficient maps of normal tissues exhibit a spatial feature distinct from those of abnormal tissues. An angular spectrum index to quantify the differences between the normal and abnormal tissues is derived, and its strength in revealing subsurface cancer in ex vivo samples is statistically analyzed.

        fabio:abstract    "Metastatic colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer death. Current options in palliation such as hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) present severe side effects. Recent research efforts suggested the therapeutic use of oxidant-enriched liquid using cold physical plasma. To investigate a clinically accepted treatment regimen, we assessed the antitumor capacity of plasma-treated saline solution. In response to such liquid, CT26 murine colon cancer cells were readily oxidized and showed cell growth with subsequent apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and upregulation of immunogenic cell death (ICD) markers in vitro. This was accompanied by marked morphological changes with re-arrangement of actin fibers and reduced motility. Induction of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype was not observed. Key results were confirmed in MC38 colon and PDA6606 pancreatic cancer cells. Compared to plasma-treated saline, hydrogen peroxide was inferiorly toxic in 3D tumor spheroids but of similar efficacy in 2D models. In vivo, plasma-treated saline decreased tumor burden in Balb/C mice. This was concomitant with elevated numbers of intratumoral macrophages and increased T cell activation following incubation with CT26 cells ex vivo. Being a potential adjuvant for HIPEC therapy, our results suggest oxidizing saline solutions to inactivate colon cancer cells while potentially stimulating antitumor immune responses. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Although solid fuel combustion emissions are known to increase the prevalence of illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer, however, their effect on the eyes is underexplored. This study assesses the acute toxicity of solid fuel combustion emissions on healthy ocular cells and a cancer cell line. Three healthy ocular cell lines (corneal, lens, and retinal epithelial cells) and a cancer cell line (Chinese hamster ovary cells) were exposed to liquid and gas phase emissions from applewood and coal combustion. Following the exposure, real-time cell attachment behavior was monitored for at least 120 hours with electrical cell impedance spectroscopy. The viability of the cells, amount of apoptotic cells, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were quantified with MTT, ApoTox-Glo, and ROS-Glo H 2 O 2 assays, respectively. The results showed that coal emissions compromised the viability of ocular cells more than applewood emissions. Interestingly, the cancer cells, although their viability was not compromised, generated 1.7 to 2.7 times more ROS than healthy cells. This acute exposure study provides compelling proof that biomass combustion emissions compromise the viability of ocular cells and increase ROS generation. The increased ROS generation was fatal for ocular cells, but it promoted the growth of cancer cells. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) include endogenous metabolites that provide information about health and disease which might be useful to develop a better screening method for breast cancer. The goal of this study was to classify mice with and without tumors and compare tumors localized to the mammary pad and tumor cells injected into the iliac artery by differences in VOCs in urine. After 4T1.2 tumor cells were injected into BALB/c mice either in the mammary pad or into the iliac artery, urine was collected, VOCs from urine headspace were concentrated by solid phase microextraction and results were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry quadrupole time-of-flight. Multivariate and univariate statistical analyses were employed to find potential biomarkers for breast cancer and metastatic breast cancer in mice models. A set of six VOCs classified mice with and without tumors with an area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC AUC) of 0.98 (95% confidence interval [0.85, 1.00]) via five-fold cross validation. Classification of mice with tumors in the mammary pad and iliac artery was executed utilizing a different set of six VOCs, with a ROC AUC of 0.96 (95% confidence interval [0.75, 1.00]). © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

In an additional two metastatic colon cancer patients, we detected CD8 + neoantigen-specific cells targeting the mutated SMAD5 and MUC4 proteins.

Moreover, the high drug loading capacity of Cet-SLN was employed to encapsulate photothermal agent indocyanine green (ICG) to finally fabricate a versatile drug delivery system (DDS) able to co-deliver Cet and ICG (Cet-SLN/ICG) for combinational chemo-photothermal therapy of breast cancer. The obtained results clearly demonstrated that Cet-SLN/ICG was well-dispersed nanoparticles with preferable stability under physiological condition. Furthermore, due to the conjugation of Cet, Cet-SLN/ICG could target EGFR which overexpress in MCF-7 cells. Most importantly, both in vitro and in vivo results suggested that compared with Cet or ICG alone, the Cet-SLN/ICG showed superior anticancer efficacy. In conclusion, Cet-SLN/ICG could be a potential platform for effective combinational chemo-photothermal therapy for breast cancer." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The integration of genomic and DNA methylation data has been demonstrated as a powerful strategy in understanding cancer mechanisms and identifying therapeutic targets. The TCGA consortium has mapped DNA methylation in thousands of cancer samples using Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 K BeadChip (Illumina 450 K array) that only covers about 1.5% of CpGs in the human genome. Therefore, increasing the coverage of the DNA methylome would significantly leverage the usage of the TCGA data. Here, we present a new model called EAGLING that can expand the Illumina 450 K array data 18 times to cover about 30% of the CpGs in the human genome. We applied it to analyze 13 cancers in TCGA. By integrating the expanded methylation, gene expression, and somatic mutation data, we identified the genes showing differential patterns in each of the 13 cancers. Many of the triple-evidenced genes identified in majority of the cancers are biomarkers or potential biomarkers. Pan-cancer analysis also revealed the pathways in which the triple-evidenced genes are enriched, which include well known ones as well as new ones, such as axonal guidance signaling pathway and pathways related to inflammatory processing or inflammation response. Triple-evidenced genes, particularly TNXB, RRM2, CELSR3, SLC16A3, FANCI, MMP9, MMP11, SIK1, and TRIM59 showed superior predictive power in both tumor diagnosis and prognosis. These results have demonstrated that the integrative analysis using the expanded methylation data is powerful in identifying critical genes/pathways that may serve as new therapeutic targets. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

However, macrophages make up a majority of immune cell infiltrates into tumors, creating natural targets for immunotherapies able to direct macrophages away from tumor-supportive functions and toward anti-tumor phenotypes. Recent studies demonstrate that toll-like receptors (TLRs) – pathways that quickly trigger early immune responses – play an important role in polarizing macrophages. Here, we present emerging ways in which TLR signaling is being manipulated in macrophages to create new opportunities for cancer immunotherapy. In particular, we discuss approaches to deliver TLR agonists, to leverage biomaterials in these therapies, and to couple TLR-based approaches with other frontline treatments as combination cancer therapies. © 2017" ;

We analyzed the immune profiles, T cell cytotoxicity, and TCR repertoire of peripheral blood, normal lung tissue, and tumor tissue from NSCLC patients. By using bispecific T-cell engager technology to assess the cytotoxicity of T cells, we found that the cytotoxicity of tumor-infiltrated T cells closely correlated with that of peripheral T cells. This correlation was supported by the immune profiles, cytokine production, and results of the TCR repertoire analysis from these specimens. We also found that the cytotoxicity of peripheral T cells has potential as a predictor of the effects of nivolumab in the tumor microenvironment.

This standard procedure relies on the slow radioactivity loss, usually attributed to the limited tumour expression of G6P-phosphatase (G6Pase). However, this classical interpretation intrinsically represents an approximation since, as in all tissues, cancer G6Pase activity is remarkable and is confined to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whose lumen must be reached by phosphorylated FDG to explain its hydrolysis and radioactivity release. The present study tested the impact of G6Pase sequestration on the mathematical description of FDG trafficking and handling in cultured cancer cells. Our data show that accounting for tracer access to the ER configures this compartment as the preferential site of FDG accumulation. This is confirmed by the reticular localization of fluorescent FDG analogues. Remarkably enough, reticular accumulation rate of FDG is dependent upon extracellular glucose availability, thus configuring the same ER as a significant determinant of cancer glucose metabolism. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Although current methods of treatment for cervical cancer can ablate lesions, preventing metastatic disseminations and excessive tissue injuries still remains a major concern. Hence, development of a safer and more efficient treatment modality is of vital importance. Natural products from plants are one of the principal sources of precursors to lead compounds with direct pharmaceutical application across all disease classes. One of these plants is Ficus carica, whose fruit latex, when applied on HPV-induced skin warts, has shown potential as a possible cure for this virus related lesions. This study explores the in vitro biological activities of fig latex and elucidates its possible mechanisms of action on cervical cancer cell lines CaSki and HeLa positive for HPV type 16 and 18, respectively. Our data shows that fig latex inhibits properties that are associated with HPV-positive cervical cancer transformed cells such as rapid growth and invasion and substantially downregulated the expression of p16 and HPV onco-proteins E6, E7. These findings suggest Ficus carica latex has the potential to be used in the development of therapeutic modalities for the possible treatment, cure and prevention of HPV related cervical cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing methods, the diversity and composition of the microbiota from ovarian cancer tissues (25 samples) and normal distal fallopian tube tissues (25 samples) were analyzed. High-throughput sequencing showed that the diversity and richness indexes were significantly decreased in ovarian cancer tissues compared to tissues from normal distal fallopian tubes. The ratio of the two phyla for Proteobacteria/Firmicutes was notably increased in ovarian cancer, which revealed that microbial composition change might be associated with the process of ovarian cancer development. In addition, transcriptome-sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses suggested that the transcriptional profiles were statistically different between ovarian carcinoma and normal distal fallopian tubes. Moreover, a set of genes including 84 different inflammation-associated or immune-associated genes, which had been named as the human antibacterial-response genes were also modulated expression.

        fabio:abstract    "Several pioneering work have established that apart from genetic alterations, epigenetic modifications contribute significantly in tumor progression. Remarkable role of EZH2 in cancer highlights the importance of identifying its targets. Although much emphasis has been placed in recent years in designing drugs and inhibitors targeting EZH2, less effort has been given in exploring its existing targets that will help in understanding the oncogenic role of EZH2 in turn which may provide a more stringent method of targeting EZH2. In the present study, we validated six direct targets of EZH2 that are GPNMB, PMEPA1, CoL5A1, VGLL4, POMT2 and SUMF1 associated with cancer related pathways. Upon EZH2 knockdown, more than two fold increase in the target gene expression was evident. CHIP-qPCR performed in both MCF-7 and MDA-MDA-231 confirmed the in-vivo binding of EZH2 on its identified target. Thirty invasive breast carcinoma cases with their adjacent normal tissues were included in the study. Immunohistochemistry in primary breast tumor tissue array showed tumor dependent expression of EZH2. Array of MERAV expression database revealed the strength of association of EZH2 with its target genes. Real time PCR performed with RNA extracted from breast tumor tissues further authenticated the existing negative correlation between EZH2 and its target genes. Pearson correlation coefficient & statistical significance computed using the matrix provided in the database strengthened the negative correlation between identified target genes and EZH2. KM plotter analysis showed improved relapse-free survival with increased expression of PMEPA1, POMT2, VGLL4 and SUMF1 in breast cancer patients indicating their therapeutic potential. While investigating the relevance of these target genes, different mutations of them were found in breast cancer patients. Seeking the clinical relevance of our study, following our recent publication that reports the role of EZH2 in nicotine-mediated breast cancer development and progression, we observed significant reduced expression of SUMF1 in breast cancer patient samples with smoking history in comparison to never-smoked patient samples. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we report that TOP1MT is overexpressed in cancer tissues and demonstrate that TOP1MT deficiency attenuates tumor growth in human and mouse models of colon and liver cancer. Due to their mitochondrial dysfunction, TOP1MT-KO cells become addicted to glycolysis, which limits synthetic building blocks and energy supply required for the proliferation of cancer cells in a nutrient-deprived tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, we show that TOP1MT associates with mitoribosomal subunits, ensuring optimal mitochondrial translation and assembly of oxidative phosphorylation complexes that are critical for sustaining tumor growth. The TOP1MT genomic signature profile, based on Top1mt-KO liver cancers, is correlated with enhanced survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Our results highlight the importance of TOP1MT for tumor development, providing a potential rationale to develop TOP1MT-targeted drugs as anticancer therapies. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

A new data integrative approach, based on graphical models, was applied on our multi-modal –omics, and clinical data cohort of metastatic melanoma patients. We found that response to chemotherapy is directly linked to ten gene expression, four methylation variables and PARP1 SNP rs1805407. PARP1 is a DNA repair gene critical for chemotherapy response and for which FDA-approved inhibitors are clinically available (olaparib). We demonstrated that two PARP inhibitors (ABT-888 and olaparib) make SNP carrier cancer cells of various histologic subtypes more sensitive to alkylating agents, but they have no effect in wild-type cells. Furthermore, PARP1 inhibitors act synergistically with chemotherapy in SNP carrier cells (especially in ovarian cancer for which olaparib is FDA-approved), but they are additive at best in wild-type cancer cells. Taken together, our results suggest that the combination of chemotherapy and PARP1 inhibition may benefit the carriers of rs1805407 in the future and may be used in personalized therapy strategies to select patients that are more likely to respond to PARP inhibitors. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Cancer remains one of the biggest threats to human society. There are massive demands for compounds to selectively kill cancerous cells. Earlier studies have shown that bovine α -lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells (BAMLET) becomes cytotoxic against cancer cells in complex with oleic acid {Hoque, M. et. al., PLoSOne8, e68390 (2013)}. In our study, we obtained bovine α-lactalbumin complexed with lanthanum ion (La 3+ -B-α-LA) and determined its high resolution crystal structure. The natural calcium binding site of bovine α-lactalbumin is replaced by lanthanum. The La 3+ complex formation by B-α-apo-LA was also supported by various biophysical methods. Interestingly, our complex, La 3+ -B-α-LA exhibits much greater anticancer activity against breast cancer cells as compared to the reported BAMLET-oleic acid complex. This study shows that La 3+ -B-α-LA complex is preferentially more toxic to MCF-7 cells as compared to KB (oral cancer) and HeLa (cervical) cells, while almost non-toxic to the healthy cells that we studied. Our data indicates that the cytotoxicity of La 3+ -B-α-LA against cancer cells is through apoptotic path way. The higher anticancer activity of La 3+ -B-α-LA is attributable to the requisite structural changes induced in the protein by La 3+ binding as supported by the crystal structure of the complex. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

However, no studies have evaluated vascular pain in patients with colorectal cancer in relation to peripheral venous administration of chemotherapy with or without oxaliplatin. We evaluated oxaliplatin-induced vascular pain using subjective and objective methods. We determined if oxaliplatin induced vascular pain in patients with colorectal cancer using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and a PainVision PS-2100 device. We compared VAS score between chemotherapy regimens with or without oxaliplatin, and between genders. We also examined the correlations of VAS score with pain intensity examined by the PainVision PS-2100, and with age and vessel diameter. A total of 98 patients with colorectal cancer were enrolled in this study, including 78 patients who received oxaliplatin via peripheral venous administration and 20 who received chemotherapy without oxaliplatin. The median VAS scores in patients with and without oxaliplatin were 36.5 (interquartile range 9.0–60.0) and 0 (0–4.0), respectively (P < 0.001), and the median pain intensities according to PainVision were 43.5 (14.3–98) and 36.5 (9.3–58.5), respectively (P < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between VAS and pain intensity (r = 0.584), but no correlation between VAS score and age (r = −0.174) or vessel diameter (r = −0.107).

One of the emerging techniques with tremendous power for lung cancer therapy is magnetic aerosol drug targeting (MADT). The use of a permanent magnet for effective drug delivery in a desired location throughout the lung requires extensive optimization, but it has not been addressed yet. In the present study, the possibility of using a permanent magnet for trapping the particles on a lung tumor is evaluated numerically in the Weibel's model from G0 to G3. The effect of different parameters is considered on the efficiency of particle deposition in a tumor located on a distant position of the lung bronchi and bronchioles. Also, the effective position of the magnetic source, tumor size, and location are the objectives for particle deposition. The results show that a limited particle deposition occurs on the lung branches in passive targeting. However, the incorporation of a permanent magnet next to the tumor enhanced the particle deposition fraction on G2 to up to 49% for the particles of 7 µm diameter. Optimizing the magnet size could also improve the particle deposition fraction by 68%. It was also shown that the utilization of MADT is essential for effective drug delivery to the tumors located on the lower wall of airway branches given the dominance of the air velocity and resultant drag force in this region. The results demonstrated the high competence and necessity of MADT as a noninvasive drug delivery method for lung cancer therapy." ;

Adjuvant chemotherapy has significantly reduced mortality but increased cognitive impairments, including attention function, making quality of life issues a crucial concern. This study enrolled nineteen breast cancer patients who were treated with standard chemotherapy within 6 months and 20 sex-matched healthy controls to investigate the brain effects of chemotherapy. All participants underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) with mean fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (mfALFF) analysis and were correlated with neuropsychological tests, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised (CAMS-R), and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), to explore the possible underlying mechanism of cognitive alternations. We found increased mfALFF over the frontoparietal lobe and decreased mfALFF over the occipital lobe in the cancer patients compared with the healthy controls; the altered brain regions may be associated with the dorsal attention network (DAN) and may be explained by a compensatory mechanism. Both MMSE and CAMS-R scores showed a positive correlation with mfALFF in the occipital lobe but a negative correlation in the frontoparietal lobe. By contrast, IES-R scores showed a positive correlation with mfALFF in the frontoparietal lobe but a negative correlation in the occipital lobe. These alterations are potentially related to the effects of both chemotherapy and psychological distress.

Mutations that occur in certain splicing factor genes themselves have been implicated in many cancers, particularly myelodysplastic syndromes. Small molecules that target splicing factors have been developed as therapies to preferentially induce apoptosis in these cancer cells.

There have been many attempts to identify markers and key pathways induced throughout EMT but the process is complex and depends on the cancer type and tumour microenvironment. Here we used the colon cancer cell line HT29, which stably overexpressed Snail, the key transcription factor in early EMT, as a model for colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with a pro-metastatic phenotype. We investigated miRNA expression regulation during that phenotypic switching. We found that overexpression of Snail in HT29 cells triggered significant changes in individual miRNA levels but did not change the global efficiency of miRNA processing. Snail abundance repressed the expression of miR-192 and miR-194 and increased miR-205, let-7i and SNORD13 levels. These identified changes correlated with the reported transcriptomic alterations in Snail-overexpressing HT29 cells. We also investigated how Snail affected the miRNA content of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from HT29 cells.

        fabio:abstract    "Solid malignancies are associated with the development of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP). This study aimed to evaluate the risk factors for PJP among patients with lung cancer. This retrospective case-control study compared patients who had lung cancer with PJP (n = 112) or without PJP (n = 336) matched according to age, sex, histopathology, and stage. PJP definition was based on (i) positive PCR or direct immunofluorescence results for pneumocystis, (ii) clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities that were consistent with a pneumonic process, and (iii) received targeted PJP treatment. The development of PJP was associated with radiotherapy (RTx), concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRTx), lymphopenia, and prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (20 mg of prednisolone equivalent per day for ≥3 weeks). Multivariate analysis revealed independent associations with prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06–3.63; p = 0.032) and CCRTx (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.27–3.43; p = 0.004). Steroid use was frequently related to RTx pneumonitis or esophagitis (29 patients, 43.3%). Prolonged high-dose steroid therapy and CCRTx were risk factors for PJP development among patients with lung cancer. As these patients had a poor prognosis, clinicians should consider PJP prophylaxis for high-risk patients with lung cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we compared The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) breast cancer genomic datasets (array and next generation sequencing (NGS) data) in detecting genomic alterations in clinically relevant genes. We performed an in silico analysis to determine the concordance in the frequencies of actionable mutations and copy number alterations/aberrations (CNAs) in the two most common breast cancer histologies, invasive lobular and invasive ductal carcinoma. We found that targeted sequencing identified a larger number of mutational hotspots and clinically significant amplifications that would have been missed by WES and SNP arrays in many actionable genes such as PIK3CA, EGFR, AKT3, FGFR1, ERBB2, ERBB3 and ESR1. The striking differences between the number of mutational hotspots and CNAs generated from these platforms highlight a number of factors that should be considered in the interpretation of array and NGS-based genomic data for precision medicine. Targeted panel sequencing was preferable to WES to define the full spectrum of somatic mutations present in a tumor. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Several oxaliplatin transporters were previously identified but their relative contributions to determining oxaliplatin tumour responses and gastrointestinal tumour cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin remains unclear. We studied clinical associations between tumour expression of oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes and patient response to oxaliplatin, then experimentally verified associations found with MRP2 in models of human gastrointestinal cancer. Among 18 oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes, MRP2 was the only one to be differentially expressed in the tumours of colorectal cancer patients who did or did not respond to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Over-expression of MRP2 (endogenously in HepG2 and PANC-1 cells, or induced by stable transfection of HEK293 cells) decreased oxaliplatin accumulation and cytotoxicity but those deficits were reversed by inhibition of MRP2 with myricetin or siRNA knockdown. Mice bearing subcutaneous HepG2 tumour xenografts were sensitised to oxaliplatin antitumour activity by concurrent myricetin treatment with little or no increase in toxicity. In conclusion, MRP2 limits oxaliplatin accumulation and response in human gastrointestinal cancer. Screening tumour MRP2 expression levels, to select patients for treatment with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy alone or in combination with a MRP2 inhibitor, could improve treatment outcomes. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

We compare optimized gene signatures for cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin responses in the same cell lines and validate each signature using data from patients with cancer. Supervised support vector machine learning is used to derive gene sets whose expression is related to the cell line GI50 values by backwards feature selection with cross-validation. Specific genes and functional pathways distinguishing sensitive from resistant cell lines are identified by contrasting signatures obtained at extreme and median GI50 thresholds. Ensembles of gene signatures at different thresholds are combined to reduce the dependence on specific GI50 values for predicting drug responses. The most accurate gene signatures for each platin are: cisplatin: BARD1, BCL2, BCL2L1, CDKN2C, FAAP24, FEN1, MAP3K1, MAPK13, MAPK3, NFKB1, NFKB2, SLC22A5, SLC31A2, TLR4, and TWIST1; carboplatin: AKT1, EIF3K, ERCC1, GNGT1, GSR, MTHFR, NEDD4L, NLRP1, NRAS, RAF1, SGK1, TIGD1, TP53, VEGFB, and VEGFC; and oxaliplatin: BRAF, FCGR2A, IGF1, MSH2, NAGK, NFE2L2, NQO1, PANK3, SLC47A1, SLCO1B1, and UGT1A1. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with bladder, ovarian, and colorectal cancer were used to test the cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin signatures, resulting in 71.0%, 60.2%, and 54.5% accuracies in predicting disease recurrence and 59%, 61%, and 72% accuracies in predicting remission, respectively. One cisplatin signature predicted 100% of recurrence in non-smoking patients with bladder cancer (57% disease-free; N = 19), and 79% recurrence in smokers (62% disease-free; N = 35).

MTH1 dephosphorylates oxidized nucleotides, thereby preventing their incorporation into DNA and protecting tumour cells from oxidative DNA damage. Inhibitors of MTH1 (TH588 and (S)-crizotinib) were shown to reduce cancer cell viability. However, the MTH1-dependency of the anti-cancer effects of these drugs has recently been questioned. Here, we have assessed anti-tumour effects of TH588 and (S)-crizotinib in patient-derived 3D colorectal cancer cultures. Hypoxia and reoxygenation – conditions that increase intracellular ROS levels – increased sensitivity to (S)-crizotinib, but not to TH588. (S)-crizotinib reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-MET and ErbB3 whereas TH588 induced a mitotic cell cycle arrest, which was not affected by adding ROS-modulating compounds. Furthermore, we show that both compounds induced DNA damage that could not be prevented by adding the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Moreover, adding ROS-modulating compounds did not alter the reduction in viability in response to TH588 and (S)-crizotinib. We conclude that TH588 and (S)-crizotinib have very clear and distinct anti-tumour effects in 3D colorectal cancer cultures, but that these effects most likely occur through distinct and ROS-independent mechanisms. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Histological iron imaging and contrast-agent free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect these deposits, but their presence in human cancer, and correlation with immunotherapeutic response is largely untested. Here, primarily using these iron imaging approaches, we evaluated the spatial distribution of polarized macrophage populations containing high endogenous levels of iron in preclinical murine models and human breast cancer, and used them as metabolic biomarkers to correlate TAM infiltration with response to immunotherapy in preclinical trials. Macrophage-targeted inhibition of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) by immunotherapy was confirmed to inhibit macrophage accumulation and slow mammary tumor growth in mouse models while also reducing hemosiderin iron-laden TAM accumulation as measured by both iron histology and in vivo iron MRI (FeMRI). Spatial profiling of TAM iron deposit infiltration defined regions of maximal accumulation and response to the CSF1R inhibitor, and revealed differences between microenvironments of human cancer according to levels of polarized macrophage iron accumulation in stromal margins. We therefore demonstrate that iron deposition serves as an endogenous metabolic imaging biomarker of TAM infiltration in breast cancer that has high translational potential for evaluation of immunotherapeutic response. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

The AP2 family also acts as a tumor suppressor. Here we found that p73 and AP2 are able to activate NEU4, a neuraminidase gene, which removes the terminal sialic acid residues from cancer-associated glycans. Under serum starvation, NEU4 was up-regulated and one of the NEU4 target glycans, sialyl Lewis X, was decreased, whereas p73 and AP2 were up-regulated. Sialyl Lewis X levels were not, however, decreased under starvation conditions in p73- or AP2-knockdown cells. p53 and AP2 underwent protein-protein interactions, exerting synergistic effects to activate p21, and interaction of p53 with AP2 was lost in cells expressing the L350P mutation of p53. The homologous residues in p63 and p73 are L423 and L377, respectively. The synergistic effect of p53/p63 with AP2 to activate genes was lost with the L350P/L423P mutation in p53/p63, but p73 bearing the L377P mutation was able to interact with AP2 and exerted its normal synergistic effects. We propose that p73 and AP2 synergistically activate the NEU4 promoter in colon cancer cells. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Treatment with increasing concentrations of HspNPs (25, 50, 75 and 100 µg/mL) resulted in 9.1-, 7-, 12.5- and 12.7-fold in increase in apoptotic cell number. Optimum doses of Hsp and HspNPs were found to increase oxidative damage in C6 glioma cells. MDA levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were found to be significantly elevated at 75 and 100 µg/mL exposure concentration of HspNPs with (p = .002) and (p = .018), respectively for 48-h treatment.

GO exhibits pH-dependent fluorescence emission in the visible/near-infrared, providing a possibility of molecular imaging and pH-sensing. It is also water soluble and has a substantial platform for functionalization, allowing for the delivery of multiple therapeutics. GO physical properties are modified to enhance cellular internalization, producing fluorescent nanoflakes with low (<15%) cytotoxicity at the imaging concentrations of 15 μg/mL. As a result, at lower flake sizes GO rapidly internalizes into HeLa cells with the following 70% fluorescence based clearance at 24 h, assessed by its characteristic emission in red/near-IR. pH-dependence of GO emission is utilized to provide the sensing of acidic extracellular environments of cancer cells. The results demonstrate diminishing green/red (550/630 nm) fluorescence intensity ratios for HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells in comparison to HEK-293 healthy cells suggesting a potential use of GO as a non-invasive optical sensor for cancer microenvironments.

        fabio:abstract    "Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells, represents early stages of metastasis and is a promising target in colorectal cancer (CRC) therapy. There have been many attempts to identify markers and key pathways induced throughout EMT but the process is complex and depends on the cancer type and tumour microenvironment. Here we used the colon cancer cell line HT29, which stably overexpressed Snail, the key transcription factor in early EMT, as a model for colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with a pro-metastatic phenotype. We investigated miRNA expression regulation during that phenotypic switching. We found that overexpression of Snail in HT29 cells triggered significant changes in individual miRNA levels but did not change the global efficiency of miRNA processing. Snail abundance repressed the expression of miR-192 and miR-194 and increased miR-205, let-7i and SNORD13 levels. These identified changes correlated with the reported transcriptomic alterations in Snail-overexpressing HT29 cells. We also investigated how Snail affected the miRNA content of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from HT29 cells. Our data suggest that the presence of Snail significantly alters the complex mRNA/miRNA interactions in the early steps of metastasis and also has an impact on the content of EVs released from HT29 cells. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Solid malignancies are associated with the development of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP). This study aimed to evaluate the risk factors for PJP among patients with lung cancer. This retrospective case-control study compared patients who had lung cancer with PJP (n = 112) or without PJP (n = 336) matched according to age, sex, histopathology, and stage. PJP definition was based on (i) positive PCR or direct immunofluorescence results for pneumocystis, (ii) clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities that were consistent with a pneumonic process, and (iii) received targeted PJP treatment. The development of PJP was associated with radiotherapy (RTx), concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRTx), lymphopenia, and prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (20 mg of prednisolone equivalent per day for ≥3 weeks). Multivariate analysis revealed independent associations with prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06–3.63; p = 0.032) and CCRTx (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.27–3.43; p = 0.004). Steroid use was frequently related to RTx pneumonitis or esophagitis (29 patients, 43.3%). Prolonged high-dose steroid therapy and CCRTx were risk factors for PJP development among patients with lung cancer. As these patients had a poor prognosis, clinicians should consider PJP prophylaxis for high-risk patients with lung cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we compared The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) breast cancer genomic datasets (array and next generation sequencing (NGS) data) in detecting genomic alterations in clinically relevant genes. We performed an in silico analysis to determine the concordance in the frequencies of actionable mutations and copy number alterations/aberrations (CNAs) in the two most common breast cancer histologies, invasive lobular and invasive ductal carcinoma. We found that targeted sequencing identified a larger number of mutational hotspots and clinically significant amplifications that would have been missed by WES and SNP arrays in many actionable genes such as PIK3CA, EGFR, AKT3, FGFR1, ERBB2, ERBB3 and ESR1. The striking differences between the number of mutational hotspots and CNAs generated from these platforms highlight a number of factors that should be considered in the interpretation of array and NGS-based genomic data for precision medicine. Targeted panel sequencing was preferable to WES to define the full spectrum of somatic mutations present in a tumor. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Several oxaliplatin transporters were previously identified but their relative contributions to determining oxaliplatin tumour responses and gastrointestinal tumour cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin remains unclear. We studied clinical associations between tumour expression of oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes and patient response to oxaliplatin, then experimentally verified associations found with MRP2 in models of human gastrointestinal cancer. Among 18 oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes, MRP2 was the only one to be differentially expressed in the tumours of colorectal cancer patients who did or did not respond to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Over-expression of MRP2 (endogenously in HepG2 and PANC-1 cells, or induced by stable transfection of HEK293 cells) decreased oxaliplatin accumulation and cytotoxicity but those deficits were reversed by inhibition of MRP2 with myricetin or siRNA knockdown. Mice bearing subcutaneous HepG2 tumour xenografts were sensitised to oxaliplatin antitumour activity by concurrent myricetin treatment with little or no increase in toxicity. In conclusion, MRP2 limits oxaliplatin accumulation and response in human gastrointestinal cancer. Screening tumour MRP2 expression levels, to select patients for treatment with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy alone or in combination with a MRP2 inhibitor, could improve treatment outcomes. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

We compare optimized gene signatures for cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin responses in the same cell lines and validate each signature using data from patients with cancer. Supervised support vector machine learning is used to derive gene sets whose expression is related to the cell line GI50 values by backwards feature selection with cross-validation. Specific genes and functional pathways distinguishing sensitive from resistant cell lines are identified by contrasting signatures obtained at extreme and median GI50 thresholds. Ensembles of gene signatures at different thresholds are combined to reduce the dependence on specific GI50 values for predicting drug responses. The most accurate gene signatures for each platin are: cisplatin: BARD1, BCL2, BCL2L1, CDKN2C, FAAP24, FEN1, MAP3K1, MAPK13, MAPK3, NFKB1, NFKB2, SLC22A5, SLC31A2, TLR4, and TWIST1; carboplatin: AKT1, EIF3K, ERCC1, GNGT1, GSR, MTHFR, NEDD4L, NLRP1, NRAS, RAF1, SGK1, TIGD1, TP53, VEGFB, and VEGFC; and oxaliplatin: BRAF, FCGR2A, IGF1, MSH2, NAGK, NFE2L2, NQO1, PANK3, SLC47A1, SLCO1B1, and UGT1A1. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with bladder, ovarian, and colorectal cancer were used to test the cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin signatures, resulting in 71.0%, 60.2%, and 54.5% accuracies in predicting disease recurrence and 59%, 61%, and 72% accuracies in predicting remission, respectively. One cisplatin signature predicted 100% of recurrence in non-smoking patients with bladder cancer (57% disease-free; N = 19), and 79% recurrence in smokers (62% disease-free; N = 35).

MTH1 dephosphorylates oxidized nucleotides, thereby preventing their incorporation into DNA and protecting tumour cells from oxidative DNA damage. Inhibitors of MTH1 (TH588 and (S)-crizotinib) were shown to reduce cancer cell viability. However, the MTH1-dependency of the anti-cancer effects of these drugs has recently been questioned. Here, we have assessed anti-tumour effects of TH588 and (S)-crizotinib in patient-derived 3D colorectal cancer cultures. Hypoxia and reoxygenation – conditions that increase intracellular ROS levels – increased sensitivity to (S)-crizotinib, but not to TH588. (S)-crizotinib reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-MET and ErbB3 whereas TH588 induced a mitotic cell cycle arrest, which was not affected by adding ROS-modulating compounds. Furthermore, we show that both compounds induced DNA damage that could not be prevented by adding the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Moreover, adding ROS-modulating compounds did not alter the reduction in viability in response to TH588 and (S)-crizotinib. We conclude that TH588 and (S)-crizotinib have very clear and distinct anti-tumour effects in 3D colorectal cancer cultures, but that these effects most likely occur through distinct and ROS-independent mechanisms. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Histological iron imaging and contrast-agent free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect these deposits, but their presence in human cancer, and correlation with immunotherapeutic response is largely untested. Here, primarily using these iron imaging approaches, we evaluated the spatial distribution of polarized macrophage populations containing high endogenous levels of iron in preclinical murine models and human breast cancer, and used them as metabolic biomarkers to correlate TAM infiltration with response to immunotherapy in preclinical trials. Macrophage-targeted inhibition of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) by immunotherapy was confirmed to inhibit macrophage accumulation and slow mammary tumor growth in mouse models while also reducing hemosiderin iron-laden TAM accumulation as measured by both iron histology and in vivo iron MRI (FeMRI). Spatial profiling of TAM iron deposit infiltration defined regions of maximal accumulation and response to the CSF1R inhibitor, and revealed differences between microenvironments of human cancer according to levels of polarized macrophage iron accumulation in stromal margins. We therefore demonstrate that iron deposition serves as an endogenous metabolic imaging biomarker of TAM infiltration in breast cancer that has high translational potential for evaluation of immunotherapeutic response. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

The AP2 family also acts as a tumor suppressor. Here we found that p73 and AP2 are able to activate NEU4, a neuraminidase gene, which removes the terminal sialic acid residues from cancer-associated glycans. Under serum starvation, NEU4 was up-regulated and one of the NEU4 target glycans, sialyl Lewis X, was decreased, whereas p73 and AP2 were up-regulated. Sialyl Lewis X levels were not, however, decreased under starvation conditions in p73- or AP2-knockdown cells. p53 and AP2 underwent protein-protein interactions, exerting synergistic effects to activate p21, and interaction of p53 with AP2 was lost in cells expressing the L350P mutation of p53. The homologous residues in p63 and p73 are L423 and L377, respectively. The synergistic effect of p53/p63 with AP2 to activate genes was lost with the L350P/L423P mutation in p53/p63, but p73 bearing the L377P mutation was able to interact with AP2 and exerted its normal synergistic effects. We propose that p73 and AP2 synergistically activate the NEU4 promoter in colon cancer cells. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Treatment of C6 glioma cells with HspNPs for 24 and 48 h resulted in dose- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability, with approximate IC50 of 28 and 21 μg/mL, respectively (p = .036 for 24 h, p = .025 for 48 h). The percentage of PCNA positive cells decreased to 20% and 10%, respectively, for Hsp- and HspNP-treated cells at concentration of 100 µg/mL. Treatment with increasing concentrations of HspNPs (25, 50, 75 and 100 µg/mL) resulted in 9.1-, 7-, 12.5- and 12.7-fold in increase in apoptotic cell number. Optimum doses of Hsp and HspNPs were found to increase oxidative damage in C6 glioma cells. MDA levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were found to be significantly elevated at 75 and 100 µg/mL exposure concentration of HspNPs with (p = .002) and (p = .018), respectively for 48-h treatment.

GO exhibits pH-dependent fluorescence emission in the visible/near-infrared, providing a possibility of molecular imaging and pH-sensing. It is also water soluble and has a substantial platform for functionalization, allowing for the delivery of multiple therapeutics. GO physical properties are modified to enhance cellular internalization, producing fluorescent nanoflakes with low (<15%) cytotoxicity at the imaging concentrations of 15 μg/mL. As a result, at lower flake sizes GO rapidly internalizes into HeLa cells with the following 70% fluorescence based clearance at 24 h, assessed by its characteristic emission in red/near-IR. pH-dependence of GO emission is utilized to provide the sensing of acidic extracellular environments of cancer cells. The results demonstrate diminishing green/red (550/630 nm) fluorescence intensity ratios for HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells in comparison to HEK-293 healthy cells suggesting a potential use of GO as a non-invasive optical sensor for cancer microenvironments.

A total of 19,785 newly diagnosed CC patients were registered during 2010–2016, among them only 16,946 (85.6%) with primary CC tumor. There was no difference in treatment modality between DM and non-DM patients. However intergroup assessment showed that type 2DM have significantly higher rate of mortality in both overall mortality (28.3%) and CC-specific (11.7%) as compared to Type 1DM (17.3%; 5.5%) and non DM patients (12.7%; 9.1%) (p < 0.001). Within group assessments showed that Type 2DM patients have better quality of life (mean 7.13 ± 3.67) (p < 0.001) and less distress levels (mean 2.41 ± 0.63) (p < 0.011) as compared to type1 DM (meant 10.54 ± 2.11; 3.19 ± 1.07). This study concluded that T2DM prognostic effect still remained after adjusting demographic and clinical parameters. Type 1 diabetes mellitus showed better OS and CSS then type2 DM. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Despite the widening range of high-throughput platforms and exponential growth of generated data volume, the validation of biomarkers discovered from large-scale data remains a challenging field. In order to tackle cancer heterogeneity and comply with the data dimensionality, a number of network and pathway approaches were invented but rarely systematically applied to this task. We propose a new method, called NEAmarker, for finding sensitive and robust biomarkers at the pathway level. scores from network enrichment analysis transform the original space of altered genes into a lower-dimensional space of pathways. These dimensions are then correlated with phenotype variables. The method was first tested using in vitro data from three anti-cancer drug screens and then on clinical data of The Cancer Genome Atlas. It proved superior to the single-gene and alternative enrichment analyses in terms of (1) universal applicability to different data types with a possibility of cross-platform integration, (2) consistency of the discovered correlates between independent drug screens, and (3) ability to explain differential survival of treated patients. Our new screen of anti-cancer compounds validated the performance of multivariate models of drug sensitivity. The previously proposed methods of enrichment analysis could achieve comparable levels of performance in certain tests. However, only our method could discover predictors of both in vitro response and patient survival given administration of the same drug. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

SPIONs entrapped in the core of the nanocomplex may act as a hyperthermia agent and generate localized heat upon excitation with an alternating magnetic field (AMF), thus enabling a thermo-chemotherapy strategy for cancer treatment. Accordingly, the cytotoxic effect and the mode of cell death triggered by the nanocomplex in combination with AMF were evaluated on two different cancer cell lines with various folate receptor (FR) expression levels, including KB nasopharyngeal cancer cells overexpressing FRs as the model and MCF-7 breast cancer cells with low level of FRs as the blank sample. The obtained results showed that KB cell death was greater than the cell death observed in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, a majority of cell death in both cell lines were related to apoptosis when the folate-modified nanocomplex was used instated of the non-folate-modified nanocomplex. Therefore, functionalizing the nanocomplex with folate modulated the response to thermo-chemotherapy by shifting the cell death pathways toward apoptosis." ;

We examined TILs grades of pretreatment cancer tissue specimens and residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab and determined the predictive utility of the TILs grade in pathological complete response (pCR) and the prognostic power of TILs in HER2-positive breast cancer. This cohort study included 128 HER2-positive breast cancer who received NAC with trastuzumab. TILs grading of the tumor stroma in pretreatment biopsy specimens and residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab was categorized as low, intermediate, and high based on the criteria of the International Working Group. In current study, the pCR rate was 64.8%, and the Relapse-free survival (RFS) was significantly worse in the non-pCR group than in the pCR group. The pCR rate correlated with the TILs grade in pretreatment tumors. In 45 non-pCR patients, TILs grade was higher in the residual tumors than in the pretreatment tumors. The RFS was significantly better in residual tumors with high TILs grade than those with low TILs grade (p = 0.033). In conclusion, assessment of the TILs grade in residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab might be necessary to determine patients with good prognosis among those who do not achieve pCR. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

However, their clinical importance in gallbladder cancer has rarely been explored. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of surgical intervention and the effectiveness of preoperative test on neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) for predicting the prognosis in gallbladder cancer patients. In this study, a total of 255 gallbladder cancer patients were retrospectively selected. For each patient, we recorded his/her treatment algorithm (with or without surgery) and their preoperative inflammatory biomarkers, as well as their detailed survival information for 5 years. A total of 216 patients received surgical intervention and the other 39 chose conservative treatment. The median survival time was 4.6 months for non-surgical group (P < 0.001), and 12.2 months for surgical intervention group. Among the surgical group, ROC analysis showed the AUC of NLR, PLR and MLR were 0.675 (95% CI: 0.600 to 0.751, P < 0.001), 0.599 (95% CI: 0.520 to 0.677, P = 0.017) and 0.607 (95% CI: 0.529 to 0.686, P = 0.009), respectively. In conclusion, surgical intervention did improve the overall survival, and elevated NLR and MLR before surgery are associated with shorter OS of GBC patients. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Most targeting strategies of anticancer drug delivery systems (DDSs) rely on the surface functionalization of nanocarriers with specific ligands, which trigger the internalization in cancer cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The endocytosis implies the entrapment of DDSs in acidic vesicles (endosomes and lysosomes) and their eventual ejection by exocytosis. This process, intrinsic to eukaryotic cells, is one of the main drawbacks of DDSs because it reduces the drug bioavailability in the intracellular environment. The escape of DDSs from the acidic vesicles is, therefore, crucial to enhance the therapeutic performance at low drug dose. To this end, we developed a multifunctionalized DDS that combines high specificity towards cancer cells with endosomal escape capabilities. Doxorubicin-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles were functionalized with polyethylenimine, a polymer commonly used to induce endosomal rupture, and hyaluronic acid, which binds to CD44 receptors, overexpressed in cancer cells. We show irrefutable proof that the developed DDS can escape the endosomal pathway upon polymeric functionalization. Interestingly, the combination of the two polymers resulted in higher endosomal escape efficiency than the polyethylenimine coating alone. Hyaluronic acid additionally provides the system with cancer targeting capability and enzymatically controlled drug release. Thanks to this multifunctionality, the engineered DDS had cytotoxicity comparable to the pure drug whilst displaying high specificity towards cancer cells. The polymeric engineering here developed enhances the performance of DDS at low drug dose, holding great potential for anticancer therapeutic applications. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Using multiple aggressive murine models of triple-negative breast cancer, we have recently demonstrated that the early administration of oncolytic Maraba virus (MRB) prior to surgical resection of the primary tumor is sufficient to minimize the metastatic burden, protect against tumor rechallenge, cure a fraction of the mice and sensitize refractory tumors to immune checkpoint blockade without the need for further treatment. Here, we apply our surgical model to other OVs: Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Adenovirus (Ad), Reovirus (Reo) and Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and show that all of the tested OVs could positively change the outcome of the treated animals. The growth of the primary and secondary tumors was differently affected by the various OVs and most of the viruses conferred survival benefits in this neoadjuvant setting despite the absence of direct treatment following rechallenge. This study establishes that OV-therapy confers long-term protection when administered in the pre-operative window of opportunity. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Recent data indicate that p130Cas association to ErbB2 protects ErbB2 from degradation, thus enhancing tumorigenesis. Therefore, inhibiting p130Cas/ErbB2 interaction might represent a new therapeutic strategy to target breast cancer. Here we demonstrate by performing Molecular Modeling, Molecular Dynamics, dot blot, ELISA and fluorescence quenching experiments, that p130Cas binds directly to ErbB2. Then, by structure-based virtual screening, we identified two potential inhibitors of p130Cas/ErbB2 interaction. Their experimental validation was performed in vitro and in ErbB2-positive breast cancer cellular models. The results highlight that both compounds interfere with p130Cas/ErbB2 binding and significantly affect cell proliferation and sensitivity to Trastuzumab.

A large number of clinical applications have revealed that Trametes robiniophila Μurr. (Huaier) exhibits an anti-tumour effect. However, loss of the bioactive components of Huaier during the extraction procedure with water is unavoidable, and the underlying mechanism of the anti-cancer effect of Huaier remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer effect of Huaier n-butanol extract, which contained 51.4% total flavonoids, on HGC27, MGC803, and AGS human GC cell lines in vitro. At a low concentration, Huaier n-butanol extract inhibited the growth of these GC cell types, induced cell cycle arrest and reduced cell metastasis. Moreover, Huaier n-butanol extract suppressed the c-Myc-Bmi1 signalling pathway, and overexpression of Bmi1 reversed the effects of Huaier n-butanol extract on GC cells. Thus, our findings indicate that Huaier n-butanol extract suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of GC cells via a c-Myc-Bmi1-mediated approach, providing a new perspective for our understanding of the anti-tumour effects of Huaier. These results suggest that Huaier n-butanol extract could be an attractive therapeutic adjuvant for the treatment of human GC. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

In the present study, we screened the anticancer potential of supernatant metabolites from eight native haloarchaeal strains obtained from a culture collection in Iran. Five human cancer cell lines including breast, lung, prostate and also human fibroblast cells as the normal control were used in the present study. Moreover, to evaluate the anti-tumor effect of the selected supernatant, inhibition of sphere formation and tumor development was assessed in-vitro and in-vivo, respectively. Among all strains, supernatant metabolites from Halobacterium salinarum IBRC M10715 had the most potent cytotoxic effect on prostate cancer cell lines (IC50 = 0.5 mg/mL) without any effects on normal cells. It significantly increased both early and late apoptosis (about 11% and 9%, respectively) in the androgen-dependent PC3 cell line, reduced sphere formation ability of DU145 and PC3 cells with down-regulation of SOX2 gene expression. Furthermore, our results revealed that tumors developed in nude mice significantly shrank post intratumor injection of metabolites of the haloarchaeal strain. In conclusion, we suggested here for the first time that supernatant metabolites from Halobacterium salinarum IBRC M10715 could be a novel component against prostate cancer in-vitro and in-vivo with remarkable reduction in stem-like properties of tumor. © 2017, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

The main HNSCC risk factors are tobacco, excessive alcohol use, and the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV positive (+) cancers are etiologically different from other HNSCC and often show better prognosis. The current knowledge regarding HNSCC miRNA profiles is still incomplete especially in the context of HPV+ cancer. Thus, we analyzed 61 freshly collected primary oral (OSCC) and oropharyngeal (OPSCC) SCC samples. HPV DNA and RNA was found in 21% cases. The Illumina whole-genome small-RNA profiling by next-generation sequencing was done on 22 samples and revealed 7 specific miRNAs to HPV+ OSCC, 77 to HPV+ OPSCC, and additional 3 shared with both; 51 miRNAs were specific to HPV− OPSCC, 62 to HPV− OSCC, and 31 shared with both. The results for 9 miRNAs (miR-9, -21, -29a, -100, -106b, -143 and -145) were assessed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction on the whole study population. The data was additionally confirmed by reanalyzing publicly available miRNA sequencing Cancer Genome Atlas consortium (TCGA) HNSCC data. Cell signaling pathway analysis revealed differences between HPV+ and HPV− HNSCC. Our findings compared with literature data revealed extensive heterogeneity of miRNA deregulation with only several miRNAs consistently affected, and miR-9 being the most likely HPV related miRNA. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Resistance to 5-Fluorouracil chemotherapy is a major cause of therapeutic failure in colon cancer cure. Development of combined therapies constitutes an effective strategy to inhibit cancer cells and prevent the emergence of drug resistance. For this purpose, we investigated the anti-tumoral effect of thirteen phenolic compounds, from the Tunisian quince Cydonia oblonga Miller, alone or combined to 5-FU, on the human 5-FU-resistant LS174-R colon cancer cells in comparison to parental cells. Our results showed that only Kaempferol was able to chemo-sensitize 5-FU-resistant LS174-R cells. This phenolic compound combined with 5-FU exerted synergistic inhibitory effect on cell viability. This combination enhanced the apoptosis and induced cell cycle arrest of both chemo-resistant and sensitive cells through impacting the expression levels of different cellular effectors. Kaempferol also blocked the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and modulated the expression of JAK/STAT3, MAPK, PI3K/AKT and NF-κB. In silico docking analysis suggested that the potent anti-tumoral effect of Kaempferol, compared to its two analogs (Kaempferol 3-O-glucoside and Kampferol 3-O-rutinoside), can be explained by the absence of glucosyl groups. Overall, our data propose Kaempferol as a potential chemotherapeutic agent to be used alone or in combination with 5-FU to overcome colon cancer drug resistance. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Considering the high prevalence and mortality rate of colorectal cancer, in this study we tried to design and validate a standard printed form and evaluate oncologists’ and nurses’ adherence to this form. This cross-sectional study was performed in Omid hospital, Mashhad, Iran from January 2015 to October 2015. A Chemotherapy form including various demographic and clinical parameters and approved chemotherapy regimens for colorectal cancer was designed by the clinical pharmacist and validated by clinical oncologists working in this center. All eligible patients admitted in this center during this period of time were included in the study. Adherence of the oncologists and nurses to this form and probable medication errors were identified by the pharmacy student. Sixty-seven patients with colorectal cancer and a total of 251 chemotherapy courses were evaluated. All patients received regimens compatible with developed form but in 206 courses (98.56%) of chemotherapy dosing error happened and in most of cases patients received lower than calculated dose (37.8%). Three errors occurred in administration step by nurses which they infused the medication in shorter than recommended duration. In general, oncologists’ adherence with developed form for chemotherapy of colorectal cancer was relatively high, except in dose calculation. Avoiding from rounding the calculated medications’ doses and precise calculation of patients’ body surface area can prevent most of medication errors and reduce risk of adverse drug reaction occurrence. © 2017, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

Nevertheless, the importance of transfusion timing is still unclear. The primary purpose of this study is to appraise whether the receipt of intraoperative blood transfusion (BT) differ from postoperative BT in regards to cancer outcomes in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients treated with nephrectomy. Data on 1168 patients with RCC, who underwent radical or partial nephrectomy as primary therapy between 1988–2013 were analyzed. PBT was defined as transfusion of allogeneic red blood cells (RBC) during surgery or the postsurgical period. Survival was analyzed and compared using the Kaplan–Meier method with the log-rank test. Of 1168 patients, 198 patients (16.9%) received a PBT. Including 117 intraoperative BT and 81 postoperative BT. Only 21 (10.6%) patients required both intraoperative and postoperative BT. On multivariate analyses, receipt of PBT was associated with significantly worse local disease recurrence (HR: 2.4; P = 0.017), metastatic progression (HR: 2.7; P = 0.005), cancer-specific mortality (HR: 3.5; P = 0.002) and all-cause mortality (HR: 2.1; P = 0.005). Nevertheless, postoperative BT was not independently associated with increased risk of local recurrence (p = 0.1), metastatic progression (P = 0.16) or kidney cancer death (P = 0.63), yet did significantly increase the risk of overall mortality (HR: 2.6; P = 0.004). In the current study, intraoperative transfusion of allogeneic RBC is associated with increased risks of cancer recurrence and mortality following nephrectomy. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

For this reason novel therapies accounting for PDAC peculiarities, such as the relevant stromal reaction, are urgently needed. Here adipose mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (AD-MSC) have been armed to constantly release a soluble trimeric and multimeric variant of the known anti-cancer TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (sTRAIL). This cancer gene therapy strategy was in vitro challenged demonstrating that sTRAIL was thermally stable and able to induce apoptosis in the PDAC lines BxPC-3, MIA PaCa-2 and against primary PDAC cells. sTRAIL released by AD-MSC relocated into the tumor stroma was able to significantly counteract tumor growth in vivo with a significant reduction in tumor size, in cytokeratin-7+ cells and by an anti-angiogenic effect. In parallel, histology on PDAC specimens form patients (n = 19) was performed to investigate the levels of TRAIL DR4, DR5 and OPG receptors generating promising insights on the possible clinical translation of our approach. These results indicate that adipose MSC can very efficiently vehicle a novel TRAIL variant opening unexplored opportunities for PDAC treatment. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Therefore, identification of novel therapeutic targets involved in melanoma progression is urgently needed for developing effective therapeutic methods. Overexpression of interleukin-13 receptor α2 (IL13Rα2) is observed in several cancer types including glioma and pancreatic cancer. Although IL13Rα2 is implicated in the progression of various types of cancer, its expression and roles in the malignant melanoma have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we showed that IL13Rα2 was expressed in approximately 7.5% melanoma patients. While IL13Rα2 expression in human melanoma cells decreased their proliferation in vitro, it promoted in vivo tumour growth and angiogenesis in melanoma xenograft mouse model. We also found that the expression of amphiregulin, a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, was correlated with IL13Rα2 expression in cultured melanoma cells, xenograft tumour tissues and melanoma clinical samples. Furthermore, expression of amphiregulin promoted tumour growth, implicating causal relationship between the expression of IL13Rα2 and amphiregulin. These results suggest that IL13Rα2 enhances tumorigenicity by inducing angiogenesis in malignant melanoma, and serves as a potential therapeutic target of malignant melanoma. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Experiment in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines demonstrated up-regulation of PKD2 led to high expression of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vim, mmp9 et al.) and EMT transcription factors(zeb1, twist, snail), and the results were reversed when PKD2 was knocked down. Further investigation showed that abrogation of PKD2 inhibited A549 cell migration, invasion, proliferation and induced cell arrest in G2/M phase.

We showed for the first time that Raman imaging can be used to distinguish successfully between glycosylated and nonglycosylated proteins in normal and cancer tissue. Thousands of protein, lipid and glycan species exist in cells and tissues and their metabolism is monitored via numerous pathways, networks and methods. The metabolism can change in response to cellular environment alterations, such as development of a disease. Measuring such alterations and understanding the pathways involved are crucial to fully understand cellular metabolism in cancer development. In this paper Raman markers of glycogen, glycosaminoglycan, chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate proteoglycan were identified based on their vibrational signatures. High spatial resolution of Raman imaging combined with chemometrics allows separation of individual species from many chemical components present in each cell. We have found that metabolism of proteins, lipids and glycans is markedly deregulated in breast (adenocarcinoma) and brain (medulloblastoma) tumors. We have identified two glycoforms in the normal breast tissue and the malignant brain tissue in contrast to the breast cancer tissue where only one glycoform has been identified. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate anti-cancer effects of NLC-Citral in MDA MB-231 cells in vitro through the Annexin V, cell cycle, JC-1 and fluorometric assays. Additionally, this study is aimed to effects of NLC-Citral in reducing the tumor weight and size in 4T1 induced murine breast cancer model. Results showed that NLC-Citral induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest in MDA MB-231 cells. Furthermore, a prominent anti-metastatic ability of NLC-Citral was demonstrated in vitro using scratch, migration and invasion assays. A significant reduction of migrated and invaded cells was observed in the NLC-Citral treated MDA MB-231 cells. To further evaluate the apoptotic and anti-metastatic mechanism of NLC-Citral at the molecular level, microarray-based gene expression and proteomic profiling were conducted. Based on the result obtained, NLC-Citral was found to regulate several important signaling pathways related to cancer development such as apoptosis, cell cycle, and metastasis signaling pathways. Additionally, gene expression analysis was validated through the targeted RNA sequencing and real-time polymerase chain reaction. In conclusion, the NLC-Citral inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells in vitro, majorly through the induction of apoptosis, anti-metastasis, anti-angiogenesis potentials, and reducing the tumor weight and size without altering the therapeutic effects of citral. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The incidence of developing cancer should increase with the body mass, yet is not the case, a conundrum referred to as Peto’s paradox. Elephants have a lower incidence of cancer suggesting that these animals have probably evolved different ways to protect themselves against the disease. The paradox is worth revisiting with the realization that most mammals encode an endogenous APOBEC3 cytidine deaminase capable of mutating single stranded DNA. Indeed, the mutagenic activity of some APOBEC3 enzymes has been shown to introduce somatic mutations into genomic DNA. These enzymes are now recognized as causal agent responsible for the accumulation of CG- > TA transitions and DNA breaks leading to chromosomal rearrangements in human cancer genomes. Here, we identified an elephant A3Z1 gene, related to human APOBEC3A and showed that it could efficiently deaminate cytidine, 5-methylcytidine and produce DNA breaks leading to massive apoptosis, similar to other mammalian APOBEC3A enzymes where body mass varies by up to four orders of magnitude. Consequently, it could be considered that eAZ1 might contribute to cancer in elephants in a manner similar to their proposed role in humans. If so, eAZ1 might be particularly well regulated to counter Peto’s paradox. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Despite recent improvements in treatment, ovarian cancer is still the leading cause of death from gynaecological malignancies. Today, marine mollusks are considered as natural source of new biologically and pharmacologically active compounds by scientists and the pharmaceutical industries. The aim of this study is to investigate the selective apoptotic effects of Turbo coronatus crude extract fractions on human epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells and mitochondria. The cells and mitochondria were isolated from cancerous and non-cancerous ovarian tissues and exposed to IC 50 concentration of F1 fraction for evaluation of mitochondrial and cellular parameters. Our results showed that F1 fraction of T. coronatus crude extract significantly induced toxic effects only in the cancerous ovarian mitochondria, including increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, mitochondrial swelling, and cytochrome c release.Flow-cytometry analysis demonstrated that F1 fraction of T. coronatus progressively induced apoptosis and necrosis only on EOC but not non-cancerous cells. We eventuallyconcluded that F1 fraction of T. coronatus crude extract selectively induces apoptosis in EOC through a ROS-mediated pathway. © 2017, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

        fabio:abstract     "Artemisinin is used as an antimalarial and anticancer agent with minimal toxic effects on the host body. Biotin-PEG-PCL polymers have been used for targeted drug delivery to cancer, as well as to improve the pharmacokinetics of the drug and reduce its effects. In this study, biotin-conjugated copolymers were fabricated with polymerization of the ring opening method and the properties of copolymer and nanoparticles were investigated using various techniques. The toxicity of artemisinin and its nanoparticles have been investigated on MCF-7 and normal HFF2 cells. The results showed that the encapsulation efficacy of artemisinin in nanoparticles was 45.5 ± 0.41%. The release profile of the drug indicates that the release is slow and controlled and is approximately pH dependent. The results of artemisinin cell culture on human breast cancer cells showed that biotin-PEG-PCL nanoparticles had an inhibitory effect on MCF-7 cells and had no toxic effects on HFF2 cells. Anticancer activity in vivo in the 4T1 breast cancer model showed that tumour volumes were decreased up 40 mm3 by ART-loaded micelles and 76 mm3 by free ART, compared to the control group (2150 mm). In vivo results showed that this formulation significantly increases the accumulation of substances in the tumours. Therefore, the molecular formulation of ART-based copolymers can be a desirable process for cancer treatment purposes. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group." ;

It has been estimated that there are about 2 billion people with a serological profile of HBV infection, and 360 million patients worldwide living with chronic HBV-associated liver disease, hence the need to find an efficient and precise diagnosis technique to drive a robust treatment for Hepatitis B virus cannot be over emphasized. The emergence of analytical device like biosensor which combines biological and physicochemical element to detect HBV in screened samples has been very helpful in providing a timely intervention to tame this virus.

        fabio:abstract    "n-Butylidenephthalide (BP) is a potential anti-cancer drug, which can be extracted from Angelica sinensis (Danggui). Previous reports have shown the effectiveness of BP in treating cancer diseases. However, BP has no targeting capacity towards specific cancer cells. To improve treatment efficiency and reduce the dose of BP used in cancer treatment, targeting-based approaches should be developed. In the present study, we used riboflavin-5′-phosphate (RFMP) immobilized iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4 MNPs) as carriers for BP to treat cancer cell lines derived from liver, prostate and breast. These model cancer cells overexpress riboflavin receptors on their cell membrane and are also sensitive to BP treatment. Thus, BP-binding free RFMP on MNPs can be used as probes to target these model cells, whereas BP can be readily released on target cancer cells. Cell viability was twofold lower by using Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs immobilized with BP than that achieved by using free-form BP at a similar amount. Moreover, BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs have no apparent harmful effects on non-target cells. In addition, we evaluated the level of cysteine-aspartic acid protease 3 (caspase 3) in the resultant cell lysate obtained after treatment by BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs to demonstrate that apoptosis is mainly involved in the growth inhibition of target cells. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

The aim of this national population-based retrospective study was to analyze the relationship between MetS and the incidence of laryngeal cancer. Patients with laryngeal cancer (ICD-10: C32) between 2009 and 2010 were retrospectively identified and tracked until 2015 using the Korean Health Insurance claims database. During the seven-year follow-up period, 5,322 subjects were newly diagnosed with larynx cancer. The mean age of people with laryngeal cancer was much higher than those without (63.29 vs. 47.7 years, p < 0.0001), and the incidence of larynx cancer in men was much higher than that in women (93.16% vs. 6.84%, p < 0.0001). Age, gender, smoking status, alcohol intake, and exercise-adjusted hazard ratios indicated that participants with MetS had a 1.13-fold higher hazard of having larynx cancer than those without MetS. The number of MetS components was a strong risk factor for laryngeal cancer with a higher risk estimate of this cancer in both ex- and current smokers as well as people who have never smoked. MetS was found to be an independent risk factor for the incidence of laryngeal cancer. In Korea, MetS and its components are significantly associated with the development of laryngeal cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

In this study, we demonstrated that FLOT2 expression levels were greatly upregulated in glioma tissues and cell lines, and the FLOT2 expression in glioma tissue was markedly associated with tumour stage and size. Overexpression of FLOT2 was correlated with poor prognosis of glioma patients. The functional assay revealed that silenced FLOT2 repressed the viability, migration, and invasion of glioma cells. And then, we detected the relationship between miR-449 and FLOT2. Luciferase reporter assay and Western blot results showed that miR-449 directly binding the 3′UTR sequence of FLOT2 and regulated FLOT2 expression in glioma cells. Finally, we detected the expression levels of miR-449 in glioma tissue and cell lines and found that miR-449 was significantly downregulated in glioma tissues and cell lines. In conclusion, we demonstrated that overexpression FLOT2 was associated with poor prognosis of glioma patients and involved in the progression of glioma, identifying a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for glioma progression. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group." ;

One of the consequences of chromosomal rearrangement is gene fusions in the cancer genome. We have previously identified a panel of fusion genes in aggressive prostate cancers. In this study, we showed that 6 of these fusion genes are present in 7 different types of human malignancies with variable frequencies. Among them, the CCNH-C5orf30 and TRMT11-GRIK2 gene fusions were found in breast cancer, colon cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, ovarian cancer and liver cancer, with frequencies ranging from 12.9% to 85%. In contrast, four other gene fusions (mTOR-TP53BP1, TMEM135-CCDC67, KDM4-AC011523.2 and LRRC59-FLJ60017) are less frequent. Both TRMT11-GRIK2 and CCNH-C5orf30 are also frequently present in lymph node metastatic cancer samples from the breast, colon and ovary. Thus, detecting these fusion transcripts may have significant biological and clinical implications in cancer patient management. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Quantifying the genetic correlation between cancers can provide important insights into the mechanisms driving cancer etiology. Using genome-wide association study summary statistics across six cancer types based on a total of 296,215 cases and 301,319 controls of European ancestry, here we estimate the pair-wise genetic correlations between breast, colorectal, head/neck, lung, ovary and prostate cancer, and between cancers and 38 other diseases. We observed statistically significant genetic correlations between lung and head/neck cancer (r g = 0.57, p = 4.6 × 10 −8 ), breast and ovarian cancer (r g = 0.24, p = 7 × 10 −5 ), breast and lung cancer (r g = 0.18, p =1.5 × 10 −6 ) and breast and colorectal cancer (r g = 0.15, p = 1.1 × 10 −4 ). We also found that multiple cancers are genetically correlated with non-cancer traits including smoking, psychiatric diseases and metabolic characteristics. Functional enrichment analysis revealed a significant excess contribution of conserved and regulatory regions to cancer heritability. Our comprehensive analysis of cross-cancer heritability suggests that solid tumors arising across tissues share in part a common germline genetic basis. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Purpose: Several previous studies have shown that oral bisphosphonates (BPs) are associated with the incidence of 13 specific cancers, including lung cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the findings are heterogeneous. Methods and results: Relevant studies published in databases such as PubMed, Embase database, and Cochrane library were systematically retrieved from inception to August 25th, 2018, regardless of language, by two investigators independently. Afterwards, the maximum adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted from the retrieved studies. Finally, 13 cohort studies involving 1,510,763 participants were enrolled into this meta-analysis. No significant relationship was found between oral BPs and the risk of all-cause cancer in osteoporosis (OP) patients among the entire population (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80–1.18; I 2 92.5%). Besides, oral BPs could remarkably reduce the incidence of breast cancer (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68–0.92; I 2 54%) and endometrial cancer (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64–0.96; I 2 0%) in postmenopausal OP females. In addition, oral BPs were also found to evidently reduce the incidence of upper gastrointestinal cancer in OP patients among the entire population (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54–0.98; I 2 36.1%). However, oral BPs may lead to increased risk of liver cancer in mixed genders (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.03–2.77; I 2 30.7%). Conclusions: Taken together, oral BPs do not increase the risk of incidence of all-cause cancer; instead, they can reduce the incidence of breast, endometrial, and upper gastrointestinal cancers among the postmenopausal OP females. Our analysis stratified by gender suggests that oral BPs may increase the incidence of liver cancer in mixed genders, while no significant association was observed in females. Careful analysis of post-marketing data should be conducted to address the clinical relevance of our results on the putative association of oral BP use and liver cancer suggested by our meta-analysis. © 2018, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play critical roles in the tumor progression. However, it remains unclear how cancer cells migrate in the three-dimensional (3D) matrix of cancer tissues and how CAFs support the cancer invasion. Here we propose a novel mechanism of fibroblast-dependent cancer cell invasion in the 3D collagen matrix. Human cancer cell lines from the pancreas (Panc-1), lung (A549) and some other organs actively adhered to normal fibroblasts and primary lung CAFs in cultures. To show its significance in tumor invasion, we designed a new invasion assay in which homogeneous microspheroids consisting of cancer cells and fibroblasts were embedded into collagen gel. Time-lapse experiments showed that cancer cells adhered to and quickly migrated on the long protrusions of fibroblasts in the 3D collagen matrix. Fibroblast-free cancer cells poorly invaded the matrix. Experiments with function-blocking antibodies, siRNAs, and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that cancer cells adhered to fibroblasts through integrin α5β1-mediated binding to fibronectin on the surface of fibroblasts. Immunochemical analyses of the co-cultures and lung cancers suggested that cancer cells could acquire the migratory force by the fibronectin/integrin signaling. Our results also revealed that the fibroblast-bound fibronectin was a preferential substrate for cancer cells to migrate in the collagen matrix. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The prognosis of pancreatic cancer remains dismal despite continuous and considerable efforts. Integrins (ITGs) are highly expressed in various malignant cancers. However, very few studies investigated the role of integrin α3 (ITGα3) in malignant cancers. Here, we determined the functional role of ITGα3 in pancreatic cancer. Analysis of public microarray databases and Western blot analysis indicated a unique expression of ITGα3 in human pancreatic cancer. Silencing ITGα3 expression significantly inhibited the viability and migration of human pancreatic cancer cells. Notably, ablation of ITGα3 expression resulted in a significant decrease of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression compared with transfection of control-siRNA through an increased number of leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domain protein 1 (LRIG1) expression. In addition, ablating ITGα3 inhibited tumour growth via blockade of EGFR signalling in vivo. Furthermore, the highly expressed ITGα3 led to a poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. Our results provide novel insights into ITGα3-induced aggressive pancreatic cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Breast cancer metastasis accounts for most of the deaths from breast cancer. Since epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in promoting metastasis of cancer, many mechanisms regarding EMT have been studied. We previously showed that Ribonucleic acid export 1 (RAE1) is dysregulated in breast cancer and its overexpression leads to aggressive breast cancer phenotypes by inducing EMT. Here, we evaluated the functional capacity of RAE1 in breast cancer metastasis by using a three-dimensional (3D) culture system and xenograft models. Furthermore, to investigate the mechanisms of RAE1-driven EMT, in vitro studies were carried out. The induction of EMT with RAE1-overexpression was confirmed under the 3D culture system and in vivo system. Importantly, RAE1 mediates upregulation of an EMT marker ZEB1, by binding to the promoter region of ZEB1. Knockdown of ZEB1 in RAE1-overexpressing cells suppressed invasive and migratory behaviors, accompanied by an increase in epithelial and a decrease in mesenchymal markers. Taken together, these data demonstrate that RAE1 contributes to breast cancer metastasis by regulating a key EMT-inducing factor ZEB1 expression, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Obesity is a risk factor for many cancers including breast, esophageal, colon, and thyroid cancer. We aimed to evaluate the association of thyroid cancer with body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and weight change. This nationwide population-based cohort study included 11,323,006 adults who joined the national health screening program. Weight change was defined as the difference between the weight of the subjects measured during the study period and the weight at the time of four years ago. For evaluating the association between the weight change and the risk of thyroid cancer, subjects without weight change for four years were defined as the reference group. Mean age was 50.1 ± 13.7 years and 44% were female. In total, 50,464 subjects (0.4%) had newly-diagnosed thyroid cancer. After multivariable analyses, the incidence of thyroid cancer increased significantly in subjects with larger WC as well as higher BMI (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). In subjects who were lean and became obese, the incidence of thyroid cancers increased significantly (hazard ratio [HR] 1.15 [1.11–1.19]). In subjects who were obese and became lean, the incidence of thyroid cancers decreased significantly (HR 0.89 [0.86–0.93]). These results demonstrated that higher BMI and larger WC were significantly associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer. Weight gain in lean subjects was associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer, and weight reduction in subjects with obesity was associated with a decreased risk of thyroid cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) has increased among Norwegian women, and is among the highest in the world. In order to understand this increase, country specific dietary exposures have been investigated. The aim of this study was to quantify the association between consumption of brown cheese, a common bread topping in Norway, and colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer in the prospective Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) Study. Data on brown cheese consumption and adjustment factors was available for 82 527 women. During a mean of 14.6 years of follow-up (1.2 million person-years), there were 1360 cases of colorectal cancer (907 colon; 453 rectal). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer sites. We modelled restricted cubic splines with 4 knots, to assess a possible non-linear relationship between brown cheese intake and the investigated cancer sites. In the age-adjusted model, consumption of more than 2 slices (>16 grams) of brown cheese per day was associated with 13% reduced risk of colon cancer (95% CI 4%-21%) compared to women who did not consume brown cheese. The multivariable-adjusted model, however, showed no association between brown cheese consumption and the risk of colorectal, colon, or rectal cancer (colorectal: HR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.76–1.13, p-trend 0.37; colon: HR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.65–1.06; p-trend = 0.10; rectal: HR = 1.16, 95% CI 0.84–1.1.61, p-trend = 0.41). In this large, prospective cohort study of women, consumption of brown cheese was suggestively protective against colon cancer. However, adjustment attenuated the inverse risk association. Brown cheese consumption was not associated with rectal cancer, or colorectal cancer overall. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Current cancer diagnosis utilizes histopathology, which requires tissue acquisition, extensive processing and, in most cases, relies on the qualitative morphological analysis of tissues and cells. Molecular biomarkers are only available for a few specific tumor subtypes. We discovered that the fluorescence polarization (Fpol) of Methylene Blue (MB) is significantly higher in cancer than in normal human breast tissues and cells. We confirmed that fluorescence polarization imaging did not affect the viability of the cells and yielded highly significant differences between cancer and normal cells using MB concentrations as low as 0.05 and 0.01 mg/ml. To explain this phenomenon we examined intracellular localization of MB and its fluorescence lifetime. We determined that higher fluorescence polarization of MB occurs due to its increased accumulation in mitochondria of cancer cells, as well as shorter fluorescence lifetime in cancer relative to normal cells. As quantitative MB Fpol imaging can be performed in vivo and in real time, it holds the potential to provide an accurate quantitative marker of cancer at the cellular level. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

However, the specific combinations of mutations responsible for the vast majority of cancers have not been identified. Current computational approaches focus on identifying driver genes and mutations. Although individually these mutations can increase the risk of cancer they do not result in cancer without additional mutations. We present a fundamentally different approach for identifying the cause of individual instances of cancer: we search for combinations of genes with carcinogenic mutations (multi-hit combinations) instead of individual driver genes or mutations. We developed an algorithm that identified a set of multi-hit combinations that differentiate between tumor and normal tissue samples with 91% sensitivity (95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 89–92%) and 93% specificity (95% CI = 91–94%) on average for seventeen cancer types. We then present an approach based on mutational profile that can be used to distinguish between driver and passenger mutations within these genes. These combinations, with experimental validation, can aid in better diagnosis, provide insights into the etiology of cancer, and provide a rational basis for designing targeted combination therapies. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

We developed a novel computational platform applying a multi-modal approach to filter out passengers and more robustly identify putative driver genes. The primary filter identifies enrichment of cancer mutations in CATH functional families (CATH-FunFams) – structurally and functionally coherent sets of evolutionary related domains. Using structural representatives from CATH-FunFams, we subsequently seek enrichment of mutations in 3D and show that these mutation clusters have a very significant tendency to lie close to known functional sites or conserved sites predicted using CATH-FunFams. Our third filter identifies enrichment of putative driver genes in functionally coherent protein network modules confirmed by literature analysis to be cancer associated. Our approach is complementary to other domain enrichment approaches exploiting Pfam families, but benefits from more functionally coherent groupings of domains. Using a set of mutations from 22 cancers we detect 151 putative cancer drivers, of which 79 are not listed in cancer resources and include recently validated cancer associated genes EPHA7, DCC netrin-1 receptor and zinc-finger protein ZNF479. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Collectively, 86.3% (63/73) of HAMPs have recurrent alterations in at least 1 cancer type and 16 HAMPs, including 9 understudied HAMPs, are identified as putative therapeutic targets across multiple cancer types. For example, the recurrent focal amplification of BRD9 is observed in 9 cancer types and genetic depletion of BRD9 inhibits tumor growth.

        fabio:abstract    "The current system for evaluating prostate cancer architecture is the Gleason grading system which divides the morphology of cancer into five distinct architectural patterns, labeled 1 to 5 in increasing levels of cancer aggressiveness, and generates a score by summing the labels of the two most dominant patterns. The Gleason score is currently the most powerful prognostic predictor of patient outcomes; however, it suffers from problems in reproducibility and consistency due to the high intra-observer and inter-observer variability amongst pathologists. In addition, the Gleason system lacks the granularity to address potentially prognostic architectural features beyond Gleason patterns. We evaluate prostate cancer for architectural subtypes using techniques from topological data analysis applied to prostate cancer glandular architecture. In this work we demonstrate the use of persistent homology to capture architectural features independently of Gleason patterns. Specifically, using persistent homology, we compute topological representations of purely graded prostate cancer histopathology images of Gleason patterns 3,4 and 5, and show that persistent homology is capable of clustering prostate cancer histology into architectural groups through a ranked persistence vector. Our results indicate the ability of persistent homology to cluster prostate cancer histopathology images into unique groups with dominant architectural patterns consistent with the continuum of Gleason patterns. In addition, of particular interest, is the sensitivity of persistent homology to identify specific sub-architectural groups within single Gleason patterns, suggesting that persistent homology could represent a robust quantification method for prostate cancer architecture with higher granularity than the existing semi-quantitative measures. The capability of these topological representations to segregate prostate cancer by architecture makes them an ideal candidate for use as inputs to future machine learning approaches with the intent of augmenting traditional approaches with topological features for improved diagnosis and prognosis. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Among 8,651,569 cancer patients, 13,311 committed suicide; the rate of suicide was 28.58/ 100,000-person years, and the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of suicide was 4.44 (95% CI, 4.33, 4.55). The predominant patients who committed suicide were male (83%) and white (92%). Cancers of the lung, head and neck, testes, bladder, and Hodgkin lymphoma had the highest SMRs (> 5-10) through the follow up period. Elderly, white, unmarried males with localized disease are at highest risk vs other cancer patients. Among those diagnosed at < 50 years of age, the plurality of suicides is from hematologic and testicular tumors; if > 50, from prostate, lung, and colorectal cancer patients. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

However, the specific combinations of mutations responsible for the vast majority of cancers have not been identified. Current computational approaches focus on identifying driver genes and mutations. Although individually these mutations can increase the risk of cancer they do not result in cancer without additional mutations. We present a fundamentally different approach for identifying the cause of individual instances of cancer: we search for combinations of genes with carcinogenic mutations (multi-hit combinations) instead of individual driver genes or mutations. We developed an algorithm that identified a set of multi-hit combinations that differentiate between tumor and normal tissue samples with 91% sensitivity (95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 89–92%) and 93% specificity (95% CI = 91–94%) on average for seventeen cancer types. We then present an approach based on mutational profile that can be used to distinguish between driver and passenger mutations within these genes. These combinations, with experimental validation, can aid in better diagnosis, provide insights into the etiology of cancer, and provide a rational basis for designing targeted combination therapies. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The UHRF1-DNMT1 axis plays a key role in DNA maintenance methylation in mammals. Accumulative studies demonstrate that UHRF1 is broadly overexpressed in cancers, which contributes to cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Interestingly, a proteasome-dependent downregulation of UHRF1 has been observed in pluripotent ground state mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) cultured in the presence of two kinase (MEK1/MEK2 and GSK3β) inhibitors (termed 2i), raising the question whether UHRF1 is similarly regulated in cancer cells. Here we present evidence that while addition of 2i broadly downregulates UHRF1 and DNMT1 in various cancer cells, distinct underlying mechanisms are involved. In contrast to mESCs, 2i-induced downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in cancer cells cannot be rescued by proteasome inhibitor and occurs primarily at the level of transcription. Furthermore, downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 by 2i is due to inhibition of MEK1/MEK2, but not GSK3β activity. Data mining reveals a marked co-expression of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in normal tissues as well as cancers. We provide evidence that multiple transcription factors including E2F1 and SP1 mediate the transcriptional activation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 by the activated MEK/ERK pathway. Together our study reveals distinct regulation of UHRF1/DNMT1 in mESCs and cancer cells and identifies activated MEK/ERK pathway as a driving force for coordinated and aberrant over-expression of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in cancers. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

When it is applied to cancer cells, solid stress hinders their proliferation rate and promotes cancer cell invasion and metastatic potential. However, the underlying mechanisms of how it is implicated in cancer metastasis is not yet fully understood. Here, we used two pancreatic cancer cell lines and an established in vitro system to study the effect of solid stress-induced signal transduction on pancreatic cancer cell migration as well as the mechanism involved. Our results show that the migratory ability of cells increases as a direct response to solid stress. We also found that Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) expression and secretion is strongly upregulated in pancreatic cancer cells in response to mechanical compression. Performing a phosphoprotein screening, we identified that solid stress activates the Akt/CREB1 pathway to transcriptionally regulate GDF15 expression, which eventually promotes pancreatic cancer cell migration. Our results suggest a novel solid stress signal transduction mechanism bringing GDF15 to the centre of pancreatic tumor biology and rendering it a potential target for future anti-metastatic therapeutic innovations. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a cancer treatment that make use of the cancer-specific accumulation of porphyrins. We have reported that mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mitROS) upregulate uptake transporter of porphyrins, heme carrier protein-1 (HCP-1). The accumulation of cancer-specific porphyrins was increased by mitROS production, thereby the cancer-specific PDT cytotoxicity was enhanced. Thus we investigated whether mitROS production by hyperthermia can enhanced the cytotoxicity of PDT or not. In this study, 1 h of hyperthermia at 42 °C increased the mitROS production, and both the accumulation of cancer-specific porphyrins and the PDT cytotoxicity increased. Moreover, the authors treated cells with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) to examine the effect of mitROS. NAC inhibited the increasing ROS production after hyperthermia to restrain the post-treatment increase of cancer-specific porphyrins accumulation. Moreover, the increase of ROS production in cancer cells after hyperthermia upregulated HCP-1 expression and downregulated ABCG2 expression. These regulation were inhibited by NAC. These results suggest that hyperthermia treatment increased mitROS production, which involved HpD accumulation and enhanced PDT effects in cancer cells. The mechanism of this phenomenon was most likely to be due to both the upregulation of HCP-1 and the downregulation of ABCG2 by mitROS. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

In this study, we assessed the relationship between breast cancer and cadaverine biosynthesis. Cadaverine treatment of Balb/c female mice (500 nmol/kg p.o. q.d.) grafted with 4T1 breast cancer cells ameliorated the disease (lower mass and infiltration of the primary tumor, fewer metastases, and lower grade tumors). Cadaverine treatment of breast cancer cell lines corresponding to its serum reference range (100–800 nM) reverted endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, inhibited cellular movement and invasion, moreover, rendered cells less stem cell-like through reducing mitochondrial oxidation. Trace amino acid receptors (TAARs), namely, TAAR1, TAAR8 and TAAR9 were instrumental in provoking the cadaverine-evoked effects. Early stage breast cancer patients, versus control women, had reduced abundance of the CadA and LdcC genes in fecal DNA, both responsible for bacterial cadaverine production. Moreover, we found low protein expression of E. coli LdcC in the feces of stage 1 breast cancer patients. In addition, higher expression of lysine decarboxylase resulted in a prolonged survival among early-stage breast cancer patients. Taken together, cadaverine production seems to be a regulator of early breast cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Exogenous overexpression of CBX6 inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation, and induced cell cycle arrest along with suppression of migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro. Microarray analyses revealed that CBX6 governs a complex gene expression program. Moreover, CBX6 induced significant downregulation of bone marrow stromal cell antigen-2 (BST2), a potential therapeutic target, via interactions with its promoter region.

        fabio:abstract    "MRI plays important roles in endometrial and cervical cancer assessment, from detection to recurrent disease evaluation. Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common malignant tumor of the female genital tract in Western countries. EC patients are divided into risk categories based on histopathological tumor type, grade, and myometrial invasion depth. EC is surgically staged using the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) system. Since FIGO (2009) stage correlates with prognosis, preoperative staging is essential for tailored treatment. MRI reveals myometrial invasion depth, which correlates with tumor grade and lymph node metastases, and thus correlates with prognosis. Cervical cancer (CC) is the second most common cancer, and the third leading cause of cancer-related death among females in developing countries. The FIGO Gynecologic Oncology Committee recently revised its CC staging guidelines, allowing staging based on imaging and pathological findings when available. The revised FIGO (2018) staging includes node involvement and thus enables both therapy selection and evaluation, prognosis estimation, and calculation of end results. MRI can accurately assess prognostic indicators, e.g., tumor size, parametrial invasion, pelvic sidewall, and lymph node invasion. Despite these important roles of MRI, radiologists still face challenges due to the technical and interpretation pitfalls of MRI during all phases of endometrial and cervical cancer evaluation. Awareness of mimics that can simulate both cancers is critical. With careful application, functional MRI with DWI and DCE sequences can help establish a correct diagnosis, although it is sometimes necessary to perform biopsy and histopathological analysis. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Our observations were confirmed in a large variety of solid and haematological malignancies. This test was able to detect dysplasia and carcinomas in situ lesions in different organs and circulating factors in cancer patients years after the removal of their lesions. To our knowledge, this ability is unique and not shared by other liquid biopsy platforms. Immunohistochemistry analysis of the xenotransplants revealed identical patterns of differentiation regardless of the cancer type, showing that differentiation through horizontal transfer might be dependent on the nature of the target cells rather than the type of cancer factors.

Various studies have shown the significance of identifying drug targets for cancer, although this process continues challenging in the field of anti-cancer drug designing. The primary purpose of this study is to design a novel approach to identify target genes for cancer. The sub-network of colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancers were constructed from human protein–protein interaction network. The potential genes were analyzed using hubs and centrality measures. For the identification of target genes, we retrieve those genes that had the highest score in both mutation rates and graph centrality. Moreover, gene deletion analysis revealed that MYC, TP53, and EGFR genes remained potential targets in colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancer respectively. Results suggest that combining network measures with mutation frequencies in cancer genes might assist in recognizing several potential drug targets. Future enhancement of this current approach is to combine these network properties with the biological insights from gene expression data, and their functions will provide a reliable method for rational drug designing. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature." ;

As extracellular matrix, glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) could bind its surface receptor adhesion molecule CD44 which is strongly expressed on breast cancer. We have previously reported a doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded HA-Lys-LA X-NPs (X-NP-DOX) NP delivery system for breast cancer treatment. In this study, we further investigated the antitumor effect of X-NP-DOX NP delivery system using low-dose DOX in both in vitro and in vivo systems. We demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX possessed the ability for inhibiting MCF-7 breast cancer cell growth, invasion, and migration, and inducing apoptosis in vitro. In in vivo experiments, injection of low-dose X-NP-DOX into tumor-bearing mouse resulted in significant reduction of tumor size. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining further revealed that low-dose X-NP-DOX induced higher percentage of apoptotic cells compared with free DOX or saline. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX inhibited Notch1 and Ras/MAPK pathways, decreased cancer stem cell population, and reduced tumorigenesis compared to free DOX in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Owing to its enhanced efficacy and higher targetability compared to free DOX, low-dose DOX delivered by NP system may be a promising novel strategy for breast cancer treatment." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Breast cancer survivors display altered inflammatory responses to immune challenges relative to cancer-naive controls likely due to previous cancer treatments, stress associated with cancer, and/or tumor physiology. Proper inflammatory responses are necessary for adaptive sickness behaviors (e.g., fatigue, anorexia, and fever) and neuroinflammatory pathways are also implicated in mental health disturbances (e.g., cognitive impairment, depression) suffered by cancer patients and survivors. Rodent cancer models indicate that tumors are sufficient to exacerbate neuroinflammatory responses after an immune challenge, however primary tumors are not usually present in cancer survivors, and the behavioral consequences of these brain changes remain understudied. Therefore, we tested the extent to which mammary tumor resection attenuates tumor-induced neuroinflammation and sickness behavior following an immune challenge (i.p. lipopolysaccharide [LPS] injection) in mice. Tnf-α, Il-1β, and Il-6 mRNA decreased in multiple brain regions of LPS-treated tumor-bearing mice relative to LPS-treated controls; tumor resection attenuated these effects in some cases (but not Tnf-α). Tumors also attenuated sickness behaviors (hypothermia and lethargy) compared to LPS-treated controls. Tumor resection reversed these behavioral consequences, although basal body temperature remained elevated, comparable to tumor-bearing mice. Thus, tumors significantly modulate neuroinflammatory pathways with functional consequences and tumor resection mitigates most, but not all, of these changes. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Although substantial advances have been obtained both in treatment and survival rates, there is still a need for new therapeutical approaches. Natural compounds are a realistic source of new bioactive compounds with anticancer activity. Among them, rosemary polyphenols have shown a vast antiproliferative capacity against colon cancer cells in vitro and in animal models. We have investigated the antitumor activity of a rosemary extract (RE) obtained by using supercritical fluid extraction through its capacity to inhibit various signatures of cancer progression and metastasis such as proliferation, migration, invasion and clonogenic survival. RE strongly inhibited proliferation, migration and colony formation of colon cancer cells regardless their phenotype. Treatment with RE led to a sharp increase of intracellular ROS that resulted in necrosis cell death. Nrf2 gene silencing increased RE cytotoxic effects, thus suggesting that this pathway was involved in cell survival. These in vitro results were in line with a reduction of tumor growth by oral administration of RE in a xenograft model of colon cancer cells using athymic nude mice. These findings indicate that targeting colon cancer cells by increasing intracellular ROS and decreasing cell survival mechanisms may suppose a therapeutic option in colon cancer through the combination of rosemary compounds and chemotherapeutic drugs. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Although cure rates are high for early stage disease, clinical outcomes for advanced, metastatic, or recurrent disease remain poor. To change this panorama, a deeper understanding of cervical cancer biology and novel study models are needed. Immortalized human cancer cell lines such as HeLa constitute crucial scientific tools, but there are few other cervical cancer cell lines available, limiting our understanding of a disease known for its molecular heterogeneity. This study aimed to establish novel cervical cancer cell lines derived from Brazilian patients. We successfully established one (HCB-514) out of 35 cervical tumors biopsied. We confirmed the phenotype of HCB-514 by verifying its’ epithelial and tumor origin through cytokeratins, EpCAM and p16 staining. It was also HPV-16 positive. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) showed relevant somatic mutations in several genes including BRCA2, TGFBR1 and IRX2. A copy number variation (CNV) analysis by nanostring and WES revealed amplification of genes mainly related to kinases proteins involved in proliferation, migration and cell differentiation, such as EGFR, PIK3CA, and MAPK7. Overexpression of EGFR was confirmed by phospho RTK-array and validated by western blot analysis. Furthermore, the HCB-514 cell line was sensitive to cisplatin. In summary, this novel Brazilian cervical cancer cell line exhibits relevant key molecular features and constitutes a new biological model for pre-clinical studies. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

To determine how cancer cells adapt to RS, we have monitored the expression of different components of the ATR-CHK1 pathway in primary tumor samples. We show that unlike upstream components of the pathway, the checkpoint mediators Claspin and Timeless are overexpressed in a coordinated manner. Remarkably, reducing the levels of Claspin and Timeless in HCT116 cells to pretumoral levels impeded fork progression without affecting checkpoint signaling. These data indicate that high level of Claspin and Timeless increase RS tolerance by protecting replication forks in cancer cells. Moreover, we report that primary fibroblasts adapt to oncogene-induced RS by spontaneously overexpressing Claspin and Timeless, independently of ATR signaling. Altogether, these data indicate that enhanced levels of Claspin and Timeless represent a gain of function that protects cancer cells from of oncogene-induced RS in a checkpoint-independent manner. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Curcumin, the active polyphenol from turmeric, helps to obstruct the growth of many types of cancers at various stages which include prostrate, melanoma, breast, brain tumor, pancreatic, leukemia, etc. The initiation and recurrence of cancer have been attributed to few mutated cells in bulk of tumor called as cancer stem cells which have the capacity of self-renewal and differentiation. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3B) is a multifunctional serine/threonine protein kinase, originally found in mammals, an important component of diverse signaling pathways, dysregulation of which leads to affect the cancer stem cell properties. The nutritional- and phytochemical-based dietary interventions may complement current chemotherapy to prevent recurrence and relapse of cancer. The objective of present study is to investigate the effect of retinoic acid and curcumin–retinoic acid conjugates against GSK-3B protein.

Endometrial cancers are associated with several critical gene mutations, including PIK3A, PTEN, and KRAS. Different gene mutations in endometrial cancer cells have varied responses to anticancer drugs and cancer therapies. The most frequently altered gene in endometrioid endometrial carcinoma tumors is PTEN. PTEN protein has lipid phosphatase and protein phosphatase activity, as well as other functions in the nucleus. Although the tumor-suppressive function of PTEN has mainly been attributed to its lipid phosphatase activity, a role for PTEN protein phosphatase activity in cell cycle regulation has also been suggested. Various tumor type-specific PTEN mutations are well documented. Here, nine endometrioid endometrial cancer cell lines with PIK3A, PTEN, and KRAS gene mutations were treated with docetaxel and radiation. One mutation with a docetaxel drug-resistant effect was a truncated form of PTEN. Among PTEN mutations in endometrial cancer cells, the Y68 frame shift mutation of PTEN constitutes a major mechanism of resistance to docetaxel treatment. The molecular mechanism involves truncation of the 403 amino acid PTEN protein at amino acid 68 by the Y68 frame shift, leading to the loss of PTEN protein phosphatase and lipid phosphatase activities. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

The present review comprehends the stimuli-responsive polymers and multi-responsiveness with respect to cancer therapy. It focuses on the exploitation of different stimuli like temperature, pH and enzymes responsiveness in a multi-stimuli setting. Nanogels and micelles being two of the most commonly used responsive polymeric carriers have also been discussed. The role of multiple stimuli delivery system is significant due to multiple changes happening in the near surroundings of cancer cells.

In contrast, antibodies to BLV were found in a very small percentage of healthy blood donors. There was no association between BLV DNA and other tumor prognostic biological markers such as hormonal receptors, HER2 oncoprotein, proliferation index, metastasis in sentinels lymph nodes, and tumor grade and size. Our findings suggest that BLV should be considered a potential predisposing factor to breast cancer in women. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Copy number loss of PIK3R1 (p85α) most commonly occurs in ovarian cancer among all cancer types. Here we report that ovarian cancer cells manifest a spectrum of tumorigenic phenotypes upon knockdown of PIK3R1. PIK3R1 loss activates AKT and p110-independent JAK2/STAT3 signaling through inducing changes in the phosphorylation of the docking protein Gab2, thereby relieving the negative inhibition on AKT and promoting the assembly of JAK2/STAT3 signalosome, respectively. Additional mechanisms leading to AKT activation include enhanced p110α kinase activity and a decrease in PTEN level. PIK3R1 loss renders ovarian cancer cells vulnerable to inhibition of AKT or JAK2/STAT3. The combination of AKT and STAT3 inhibitors significantly increases the anti-tumor effect compared to single-agent treatments. Together, our findings provide a rationale for mechanism-based therapeutic approach that targets tumors with loss of PIK3R1. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we perform Repli-Seq and integrated epigenome analyses and demonstrate that genomic regions that undergo long-range epigenetic deregulation in prostate cancer also show concordant differences in replication timing. A subset of altered replication timing domains are conserved across cancers from different tissue origins. Notably, late-replicating regions in cancer cells display a loss of DNA methylation, and a switch in heterochromatin features from H3K9me3-marked constitutive to H3K27me3-marked facultative heterochromatin. Finally, analysis of 214 prostate and 35 breast cancer genomes reveal that late-replicating regions are prone to cis and early-replication to trans chromosomal rearrangements. Together, our data suggests that the nature of chromosomal rearrangement in cancer is related to the spatial and temporal positioning and altered epigenetic states of early-replicating compared to late-replicating loci. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are promising therapies for haematological cancers. Historically, their therapeutic benefit is due to ADC targeting of lineage-restricted antigens. The C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is attractive for targeted therapy of haematological cancers, given its expression in multiple tumour types and role in cancer “homing” to bone marrow. However, CXCR4 is also expressed in haematopoietic cells and other normal tissues, raising safety challenges to the development of anti-CXCR4 ADCs for cancer treatment. Here, we designed the first anti-CXCR4 ADC with favourable therapeutic index, effective in xenografts of haematopoietic cancers resistant to standard of care and anti-CXCR4 antibodies. We screened multiple ADC configurations, by varying type of linker-payload, drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR), affinity and Fc format. The optimal ADC bears a non-cleavable linker, auristatin as payload at DAR = 4 and a low affinity antibody with effector–reduced Fc. Contrary to other drugs targeting CXCR4, anti-CXCR4 ADCs effectively eliminated cancer cells as monotherapy, while minimizing leucocytosis. The optimal ADC selectively eliminated CXCR4 + cancer cells in solid tumours, but showed limited toxicity to normal CXCR4 + tissues, sparing haematopoietic stem cells and progenitors. Our work provides proof-of-concept that through empirical ADC design, it is possible to target proteins with broad normal tissue expression. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Cancers in the bone produce a number of severe symptoms including pain that compromises patient functional status, quality of life, and survival. The source of this pain is multifaceted and includes factors secreted from tumor cells. Malignant cells release the neurotransmitter and cell-signaling molecule glutamate via the oxidative stress-related cystine/glutamate antiporter, system x C − , which reciprocally imports cystine for synthesis of glutathione and the cystine/cysteine redox cycle. Pharmacological inhibition of system x C − has shown success in reducing and delaying the onset of cancer pain-related behavior in mouse models. This investigation describes the development of a stable siRNA-induced knockdown of the functional trans-membrane system x C − subunit xCT (SLC7A11) in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Clones were verified for xCT knockdown at the transcript, protein, and functional levels. RNAseq was performed on a representative clone to comprehensively examine the transcriptional cellular signature in response to xCT knockdown, identifying multiple differentially regulated factors relevant to cancer pain including nerve growth factor, interleukin-1, and colony-stimulating factor-1. Mice were inoculated intrafemorally and recordings of pain-related behaviors including weight bearing, mechanical withdrawal, and limb use were performed. Animals implanted with xCT knockdown cancer cells displayed a delay until the onset of nociceptive behaviors relative to control cells. These results add to the body of evidence suggesting that a reduction in glutamate release from cancers in bone by inhibition of the system x C − transporter may decrease the severe and intractable pain associated with bone metastases. © The Author(s) 2019." ;

Method: For finding the related articles, the researchers searched several databases including PubMed &ProQuest and valid websites including ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Scientific Information Database, and Magiran. The key terms of \"reflexology, cancer, and chemotherapy\" individually and combined together were searched in Parisian and English, and the studies performed from 2009 to 2018 were extracted. Due to the lack of sufficient studies carried out into the outcome of reflexology on chemotherapy, both Persian and English articles were used. Results: A total of 57 studies were extracted from the databases and valid websites; five of which met the inclusion criteria. All selected studies were clinical trials. Implications for Practice: Reflexology can be used as a non-pharmacologic nursing intervention to alleviate the side effects of chemotherapy and improve the quality of life of cancer patients. © 2019 Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

For effective evaluation of this strategy it is crucial to identify which patients are suited for CD47-targeted therapy. In this respect, expression of the pro-phagocytic signal SLAMF7 on both macrophages and cancer cells was recently reported to be a requisite for CD47 antibody-mediated phagocytosis. Here, we demonstrate that in fact SLAMF7 expression on cancer cells is not required and does not impact on CD47 antibody therapy. Moreover, SLAMF7 also does not impact on phagocytosis induction by CD20 antibody rituximab nor associates with overall survival of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma patients. In contrast, expression of CD47 negatively impacts on overall and progression free survival. In conclusion, cancer cell expression of SLAMF7 is not required for phagocytosis and, in contrast to CD47 expression, should not be used as selection criterion for CD47-targeted therapy. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Increased Crabp2 levels have been found in various types of cancer, and are associated with poor patients’ survival. Although Crabp2 is found to be overexpressed in lung cancer, its role in metastasis of lung cancer is unclear. In this study, Crabp2 was overexpressed in high-metastatic C10F4 than low-metastatic lung cancer cells. Analysis of clinical samples revealed that high CRABP2 levels were correlated with lymph node metastases, poor overall survival, and increased recurrence. Knockdown of Crabp2 decreased migration, invasion, anoikis resistance, and in vivo metastasis. Crabp2 was co-immunoprecipitated with HuR, and overexpression of Crabp2 increased HuR levels, which promoted integrin β1/FAK/ERK signaling. Inhibition of HuR or integrin β1/FAK/ERK signaling reversed the promoting effect of Crabp2 in migration, invasion, and anoikis resistance. Knockdown of Crabp2 further inhibited the growth of cancer cells as compared with that by gemcitabine or irinotecan alone. The expression of Crabp2 in human lung tumors was correlated with stress marker CHOP. In conclusion, our findings have identified the promoting role of Crabp2 in anoikis resistance and metastasis. CRABP2 may serve as a prognostic marker and targeting CRABP2 may be exploited as a modality to reduce metastasis. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "SPG-56 is a newly isolated glycoprotein from sweet potatoes (Zhongshu NO. 1), but its value for suppressing breast cancer progression remains unknown. This study was designed to investigate the potential anti-cancer effects of SPG-56, which consists of 2.9% sugar and 97.1% protein. The effects of SPG-56 on the proliferation and apoptosis of breast cancer cells were determined using CCK-8 and Hoechst 33342 assays and flow cytometry, after staining with Annexin V and PI respectively. The activities of SPG-56 against breast cancer were examined using female BALB/c nude mice orthotopically implanted with human breast carcinoma cells of the types MCF-7 and 4T1-Luc. The cellular experiments showed that SPG-56 inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of MCF-7 cells dose- and time-dependently. Oral administration of SPG-56 significantly suppressed the development of MCF-7 tumor cells (P < 0.01) as compared with an untreated group. The serum tumor markers CEA, CA125 and CA153 in a 240 mg/kg/d SPG-56 decreased by 54.8%, 91.8%, and 90.3%, respectively. The experiments further demonstrated that SPG-56 inhibited the metastasis of breast cancer in MCF-7 and 4T1-bearing mice by altering the expression of MMP2, MMP9, VEGF, Occludin and Claudin. It is concluded that SPG-56 may have potential as a novel anti-tumor candidate for breast cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Lymph node metastasis is of major prognostic significance for breast cancer. Lymph node metastasis arises at a very early stage in some patients. Using the data downloaded from the TCGA database, we studied the differences between primary tumors with and without lymph node metastasis at the multi-omics level using bioinformatics approaches. Our study found that low mutation and neoantigen burdens correlated with lymph node metastazation of breast cancer. All three conserved domains in TP53 were mutated in lymph node-negative breast cancers, whereas only one domain was mutated in lymph node-positive samples. Mutations in microtubule-related proteins appear to help immune cells recognize tumors and inhibit their lymph node metastasis. Destroying microtubule-related proteins is a potential therapeutic strategy to inhibit lymph node metastasis of breast cancer. As the neoantigens specifically present in lymph node-positive breast cancers, MAPK10, BC9L, TRIM65, CD93, KITLG, CNPPD1, CPED1, CCDC146, TMEM185A, INO80D, and PSMD11 are potential targets for vaccine design. In the tumor microenvironment, reduced numbers of effector immune cells, especially activated memory CD4+ T cells and activated mast cells, facilitate breast cancer metastasis to the lymph nodes. According to transcriptome data, lymph node metastasis was mostly driven by gene mutation rather than by gene expression. Although differential gene expression analysis was based on lymph node metastasis status, many genes were shown to be differentially expressed based on estrogen receptor status. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Fibroblasts turn into cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumour microenvironment. CAFs have recently attracted attention for their function as a regulator of immune cell recruitment and function in addition to their tumour-promoting roles. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of CAFs on monocyte recruitment and macrophage polarization in breast cancer. CAFs, which were α-SMA expressing fibroblasts in contrast to normal fibroblasts (NFs), effectively recruited monocytes. Recruitment of monocytes by CAFs might be mediated by monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) as well as stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) cytokines. CAFs differentiated the recruited monocytes into M2-like macrophages which are capable of exerting their immunosuppressive roles via the PD-1 axis. CAF-educated monocytes exhibited strong immune suppression unlike NF-educated monocytes and enhanced the motility/invasion of breast cancer cells in addition to increasing the expressions of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes and vimentin protein in cancer cells. CAF-educated M1 macrophages displayed increased expression of M2 markers and production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in contrast to decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12 compared with control M1 macrophages; suggesting that CAFs were also able to induce the trans-differentiation of M1 macrophages to M2 macrophages. We then investigated the relationship between the infiltration of CAFs and tumour associated macrophages (TAMs) using tissue samples obtained from breast cancer patients. High grade of CAFs significantly correlated with the number of TAMs in human breast cancer tissue samples. It was also associated with higher Ki-67 proliferation index, and higher tumour volume. This result is in line with our finding of increased breast cancer cell proliferation due to the effects of CAF-educated monocytes in vitro. Our results concluded that CAFs play pivotal roles in sculpturing the tumour microenvironment in breast cancer, and therapeutic strategies to reverse the CAF-mediated immunosuppressive microenvironment should be taken into consideration. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

We construct iCells of four cancers and the corresponding tissue controls and identify the most rewired genes in cancer. Many of them are of unknown function and cannot be identified as different in cancer in any specific molecular network. We biologically validate that they have a role in cancer by knockdown experiments followed by cell viability assays. We find additional support through Kaplan-Meier survival curves of thousands of patients. Finally, we extend this analysis to uncover pan-cancer genes.

The increasing popularity of sequencing technologies motivates the in-silico identification of CCLs based on their mutational fingerprint, but care must be taken when identifying heterogeneous data. We recently developed the proof-of-concept Uniquorn 1 method which could reliably identify heterogeneous sequencing data from selected sequencing technologies. Here we present Uniquorn 2, a generic and robust in-silico identification method for CCLs with DNA/RNA-seq and panel-seq information. We benchmarked Uniquorn 2 by cross-identifying 1612 RNA and 3596 panel-sized NGS profiles derived from 1516 CCLs, five repositories, four technologies and three major cancer panel-designs. Our method achieves an accuracy of 96% for RNA-seq and 95% for mixed DNA-seq and RNA-seq identification. Even for a panel of only 94 cancer-related genes, accuracy remains at 82% but decreases when using smaller panels.

In this ex vivo study of nine fresh human colon specimens, we report the first use of quantified subsurface scattering coefficient maps acquired by swept-source optical coherence tomography to reveal subsurface abnormities. We generate subsurface scattering coefficient maps with a novel wavelet-based-curve-fitting method that provides significantly improved accuracy. The angular spectra of scattering coefficient maps of normal tissues exhibit a spatial feature distinct from those of abnormal tissues. An angular spectrum index to quantify the differences between the normal and abnormal tissues is derived, and its strength in revealing subsurface cancer in ex vivo samples is statistically analyzed. The study demonstrates that the angular spectrum of the scattering coefficient map can effectively reveal subsurface colorectal cancer and potentially provide a fast and more accurate diagnosis. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Current options in palliation such as hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) present severe side effects. Recent research efforts suggested the therapeutic use of oxidant-enriched liquid using cold physical plasma. To investigate a clinically accepted treatment regimen, we assessed the antitumor capacity of plasma-treated saline solution. In response to such liquid, CT26 murine colon cancer cells were readily oxidized and showed cell growth with subsequent apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and upregulation of immunogenic cell death (ICD) markers in vitro. This was accompanied by marked morphological changes with re-arrangement of actin fibers and reduced motility. Induction of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype was not observed. Key results were confirmed in MC38 colon and PDA6606 pancreatic cancer cells. Compared to plasma-treated saline, hydrogen peroxide was inferiorly toxic in 3D tumor spheroids but of similar efficacy in 2D models. In vivo, plasma-treated saline decreased tumor burden in Balb/C mice. This was concomitant with elevated numbers of intratumoral macrophages and increased T cell activation following incubation with CT26 cells ex vivo. Being a potential adjuvant for HIPEC therapy, our results suggest oxidizing saline solutions to inactivate colon cancer cells while potentially stimulating antitumor immune responses. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Although solid fuel combustion emissions are known to increase the prevalence of illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer, however, their effect on the eyes is underexplored. This study assesses the acute toxicity of solid fuel combustion emissions on healthy ocular cells and a cancer cell line. Three healthy ocular cell lines (corneal, lens, and retinal epithelial cells) and a cancer cell line (Chinese hamster ovary cells) were exposed to liquid and gas phase emissions from applewood and coal combustion. Following the exposure, real-time cell attachment behavior was monitored for at least 120 hours with electrical cell impedance spectroscopy. The viability of the cells, amount of apoptotic cells, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were quantified with MTT, ApoTox-Glo, and ROS-Glo H 2 O 2 assays, respectively. The results showed that coal emissions compromised the viability of ocular cells more than applewood emissions. Interestingly, the cancer cells, although their viability was not compromised, generated 1.7 to 2.7 times more ROS than healthy cells. This acute exposure study provides compelling proof that biomass combustion emissions compromise the viability of ocular cells and increase ROS generation. The increased ROS generation was fatal for ocular cells, but it promoted the growth of cancer cells. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

The goal of this study was to classify mice with and without tumors and compare tumors localized to the mammary pad and tumor cells injected into the iliac artery by differences in VOCs in urine. After 4T1.2 tumor cells were injected into BALB/c mice either in the mammary pad or into the iliac artery, urine was collected, VOCs from urine headspace were concentrated by solid phase microextraction and results were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry quadrupole time-of-flight. Multivariate and univariate statistical analyses were employed to find potential biomarkers for breast cancer and metastatic breast cancer in mice models. A set of six VOCs classified mice with and without tumors with an area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC AUC) of 0.98 (95% confidence interval [0.85, 1.00]) via five-fold cross validation.

Moreover, the high drug loading capacity of Cet-SLN was employed to encapsulate photothermal agent indocyanine green (ICG) to finally fabricate a versatile drug delivery system (DDS) able to co-deliver Cet and ICG (Cet-SLN/ICG) for combinational chemo-photothermal therapy of breast cancer. The obtained results clearly demonstrated that Cet-SLN/ICG was well-dispersed nanoparticles with preferable stability under physiological condition. Furthermore, due to the conjugation of Cet, Cet-SLN/ICG could target EGFR which overexpress in MCF-7 cells. Most importantly, both in vitro and in vivo results suggested that compared with Cet or ICG alone, the Cet-SLN/ICG showed superior anticancer efficacy.

        fabio:abstract    "The integration of genomic and DNA methylation data has been demonstrated as a powerful strategy in understanding cancer mechanisms and identifying therapeutic targets. The TCGA consortium has mapped DNA methylation in thousands of cancer samples using Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 K BeadChip (Illumina 450 K array) that only covers about 1.5% of CpGs in the human genome. Therefore, increasing the coverage of the DNA methylome would significantly leverage the usage of the TCGA data. Here, we present a new model called EAGLING that can expand the Illumina 450 K array data 18 times to cover about 30% of the CpGs in the human genome. We applied it to analyze 13 cancers in TCGA. By integrating the expanded methylation, gene expression, and somatic mutation data, we identified the genes showing differential patterns in each of the 13 cancers. Many of the triple-evidenced genes identified in majority of the cancers are biomarkers or potential biomarkers. Pan-cancer analysis also revealed the pathways in which the triple-evidenced genes are enriched, which include well known ones as well as new ones, such as axonal guidance signaling pathway and pathways related to inflammatory processing or inflammation response. Triple-evidenced genes, particularly TNXB, RRM2, CELSR3, SLC16A3, FANCI, MMP9, MMP11, SIK1, and TRIM59 showed superior predictive power in both tumor diagnosis and prognosis. These results have demonstrated that the integrative analysis using the expanded methylation data is powerful in identifying critical genes/pathways that may serve as new therapeutic targets. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "A key challenge facing immunotherapy is poor infiltration of T cells into tumors, along with suppression of cells reaching these sites. However, macrophages make up a majority of immune cell infiltrates into tumors, creating natural targets for immunotherapies able to direct macrophages away from tumor-supportive functions and toward anti-tumor phenotypes. Recent studies demonstrate that toll-like receptors (TLRs) – pathways that quickly trigger early immune responses – play an important role in polarizing macrophages. Here, we present emerging ways in which TLR signaling is being manipulated in macrophages to create new opportunities for cancer immunotherapy. In particular, we discuss approaches to deliver TLR agonists, to leverage biomaterials in these therapies, and to couple TLR-based approaches with other frontline treatments as combination cancer therapies. © 2019" ;

However, immune checkpoint inhibitors are only advantageous for a limited population of cancer patients. Therefore, companion diagnostics are needed in order to identify patients for whom these therapies are effective. In the present study, we evaluated detailed immunological aspects in clinical specimens from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. We analyzed the immune profiles, T cell cytotoxicity, and TCR repertoire of peripheral blood, normal lung tissue, and tumor tissue from NSCLC patients. By using bispecific T-cell engager technology to assess the cytotoxicity of T cells, we found that the cytotoxicity of tumor-infiltrated T cells closely correlated with that of peripheral T cells. This correlation was supported by the immune profiles, cytokine production, and results of the TCR repertoire analysis from these specimens. We also found that the cytotoxicity of peripheral T cells has potential as a predictor of the effects of nivolumab in the tumor microenvironment. These results imply further applications to blood-based immune monitoring systems and predictive biomarkers for cancer immunotherapy. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

This standard procedure relies on the slow radioactivity loss, usually attributed to the limited tumour expression of G6P-phosphatase (G6Pase). However, this classical interpretation intrinsically represents an approximation since, as in all tissues, cancer G6Pase activity is remarkable and is confined to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whose lumen must be reached by phosphorylated FDG to explain its hydrolysis and radioactivity release. The present study tested the impact of G6Pase sequestration on the mathematical description of FDG trafficking and handling in cultured cancer cells. Our data show that accounting for tracer access to the ER configures this compartment as the preferential site of FDG accumulation. This is confirmed by the reticular localization of fluorescent FDG analogues. Remarkably enough, reticular accumulation rate of FDG is dependent upon extracellular glucose availability, thus configuring the same ER as a significant determinant of cancer glucose metabolism. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Although current methods of treatment for cervical cancer can ablate lesions, preventing metastatic disseminations and excessive tissue injuries still remains a major concern. Hence, development of a safer and more efficient treatment modality is of vital importance. Natural products from plants are one of the principal sources of precursors to lead compounds with direct pharmaceutical application across all disease classes. One of these plants is Ficus carica, whose fruit latex, when applied on HPV-induced skin warts, has shown potential as a possible cure for this virus related lesions. This study explores the in vitro biological activities of fig latex and elucidates its possible mechanisms of action on cervical cancer cell lines CaSki and HeLa positive for HPV type 16 and 18, respectively. Our data shows that fig latex inhibits properties that are associated with HPV-positive cervical cancer transformed cells such as rapid growth and invasion and substantially downregulated the expression of p16 and HPV onco-proteins E6, E7. These findings suggest Ficus carica latex has the potential to be used in the development of therapeutic modalities for the possible treatment, cure and prevention of HPV related cervical cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing methods, the diversity and composition of the microbiota from ovarian cancer tissues (25 samples) and normal distal fallopian tube tissues (25 samples) were analyzed. High-throughput sequencing showed that the diversity and richness indexes were significantly decreased in ovarian cancer tissues compared to tissues from normal distal fallopian tubes. The ratio of the two phyla for Proteobacteria/Firmicutes was notably increased in ovarian cancer, which revealed that microbial composition change might be associated with the process of ovarian cancer development. In addition, transcriptome-sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses suggested that the transcriptional profiles were statistically different between ovarian carcinoma and normal distal fallopian tubes. Moreover, a set of genes including 84 different inflammation-associated or immune-associated genes, which had been named as the human antibacterial-response genes were also modulated expression. Therefore, we hypothesize that the microbial composition change, as a novel risk factor, may be involving the initiation and progression of ovarian cancer via influencing and regulating the local immune microenvironment of fallopian tubes except for regular pathways. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Several pioneering work have established that apart from genetic alterations, epigenetic modifications contribute significantly in tumor progression. Remarkable role of EZH2 in cancer highlights the importance of identifying its targets. Although much emphasis has been placed in recent years in designing drugs and inhibitors targeting EZH2, less effort has been given in exploring its existing targets that will help in understanding the oncogenic role of EZH2 in turn which may provide a more stringent method of targeting EZH2. In the present study, we validated six direct targets of EZH2 that are GPNMB, PMEPA1, CoL5A1, VGLL4, POMT2 and SUMF1 associated with cancer related pathways. Upon EZH2 knockdown, more than two fold increase in the target gene expression was evident. CHIP-qPCR performed in both MCF-7 and MDA-MDA-231 confirmed the in-vivo binding of EZH2 on its identified target. Thirty invasive breast carcinoma cases with their adjacent normal tissues were included in the study. Immunohistochemistry in primary breast tumor tissue array showed tumor dependent expression of EZH2. Array of MERAV expression database revealed the strength of association of EZH2 with its target genes. Real time PCR performed with RNA extracted from breast tumor tissues further authenticated the existing negative correlation between EZH2 and its target genes. Pearson correlation coefficient & statistical significance computed using the matrix provided in the database strengthened the negative correlation between identified target genes and EZH2. KM plotter analysis showed improved relapse-free survival with increased expression of PMEPA1, POMT2, VGLL4 and SUMF1 in breast cancer patients indicating their therapeutic potential. While investigating the relevance of these target genes, different mutations of them were found in breast cancer patients. Seeking the clinical relevance of our study, following our recent publication that reports the role of EZH2 in nicotine-mediated breast cancer development and progression, we observed significant reduced expression of SUMF1 in breast cancer patient samples with smoking history in comparison to never-smoked patient samples. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we report that TOP1MT is overexpressed in cancer tissues and demonstrate that TOP1MT deficiency attenuates tumor growth in human and mouse models of colon and liver cancer. Due to their mitochondrial dysfunction, TOP1MT-KO cells become addicted to glycolysis, which limits synthetic building blocks and energy supply required for the proliferation of cancer cells in a nutrient-deprived tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, we show that TOP1MT associates with mitoribosomal subunits, ensuring optimal mitochondrial translation and assembly of oxidative phosphorylation complexes that are critical for sustaining tumor growth. The TOP1MT genomic signature profile, based on Top1mt-KO liver cancers, is correlated with enhanced survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients.

A new data integrative approach, based on graphical models, was applied on our multi-modal –omics, and clinical data cohort of metastatic melanoma patients. We found that response to chemotherapy is directly linked to ten gene expression, four methylation variables and PARP1 SNP rs1805407. PARP1 is a DNA repair gene critical for chemotherapy response and for which FDA-approved inhibitors are clinically available (olaparib). We demonstrated that two PARP inhibitors (ABT-888 and olaparib) make SNP carrier cancer cells of various histologic subtypes more sensitive to alkylating agents, but they have no effect in wild-type cells. Furthermore, PARP1 inhibitors act synergistically with chemotherapy in SNP carrier cells (especially in ovarian cancer for which olaparib is FDA-approved), but they are additive at best in wild-type cancer cells. Taken together, our results suggest that the combination of chemotherapy and PARP1 inhibition may benefit the carriers of rs1805407 in the future and may be used in personalized therapy strategies to select patients that are more likely to respond to PARP inhibitors. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Earlier studies have shown that bovine α -lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells (BAMLET) becomes cytotoxic against cancer cells in complex with oleic acid {Hoque, M. et. al., PLoSOne8, e68390 (2013)}. In our study, we obtained bovine α-lactalbumin complexed with lanthanum ion (La 3+ -B-α-LA) and determined its high resolution crystal structure. The natural calcium binding site of bovine α-lactalbumin is replaced by lanthanum. The La 3+ complex formation by B-α-apo-LA was also supported by various biophysical methods. Interestingly, our complex, La 3+ -B-α-LA exhibits much greater anticancer activity against breast cancer cells as compared to the reported BAMLET-oleic acid complex. This study shows that La 3+ -B-α-LA complex is preferentially more toxic to MCF-7 cells as compared to KB (oral cancer) and HeLa (cervical) cells, while almost non-toxic to the healthy cells that we studied. Our data indicates that the cytotoxicity of La 3+ -B-α-LA against cancer cells is through apoptotic path way. The higher anticancer activity of La 3+ -B-α-LA is attributable to the requisite structural changes induced in the protein by La 3+ binding as supported by the crystal structure of the complex. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

However, no studies have evaluated vascular pain in patients with colorectal cancer in relation to peripheral venous administration of chemotherapy with or without oxaliplatin. We evaluated oxaliplatin-induced vascular pain using subjective and objective methods. We determined if oxaliplatin induced vascular pain in patients with colorectal cancer using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and a PainVision PS-2100 device. We compared VAS score between chemotherapy regimens with or without oxaliplatin, and between genders. We also examined the correlations of VAS score with pain intensity examined by the PainVision PS-2100, and with age and vessel diameter. A total of 98 patients with colorectal cancer were enrolled in this study, including 78 patients who received oxaliplatin via peripheral venous administration and 20 who received chemotherapy without oxaliplatin. The median VAS scores in patients with and without oxaliplatin were 36.5 (interquartile range 9.0–60.0) and 0 (0–4.0), respectively (P < 0.001), and the median pain intensities according to PainVision were 43.5 (14.3–98) and 36.5 (9.3–58.5), respectively (P < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between VAS and pain intensity (r = 0.584), but no correlation between VAS score and age (r = −0.174) or vessel diameter (r = −0.107). Peripheral venous administration of oxaliplatin induced vascular pain, measured both subjectively and objectively, in patients with colorectal cancer, regardless of vessel diameter. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Primary bronchial cancer accounts for almost 20% of all cancer death worldwide. One of the emerging techniques with tremendous power for lung cancer therapy is magnetic aerosol drug targeting (MADT). The use of a permanent magnet for effective drug delivery in a desired location throughout the lung requires extensive optimization, but it has not been addressed yet. In the present study, the possibility of using a permanent magnet for trapping the particles on a lung tumor is evaluated numerically in the Weibel's model from G0 to G3. The effect of different parameters is considered on the efficiency of particle deposition in a tumor located on a distant position of the lung bronchi and bronchioles. Also, the effective position of the magnetic source, tumor size, and location are the objectives for particle deposition. The results show that a limited particle deposition occurs on the lung branches in passive targeting. However, the incorporation of a permanent magnet next to the tumor enhanced the particle deposition fraction on G2 to up to 49% for the particles of 7 µm diameter. Optimizing the magnet size could also improve the particle deposition fraction by 68%. It was also shown that the utilization of MADT is essential for effective drug delivery to the tumors located on the lower wall of airway branches given the dominance of the air velocity and resultant drag force in this region. The results demonstrated the high competence and necessity of MADT as a noninvasive drug delivery method for lung cancer therapy." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. Adjuvant chemotherapy has significantly reduced mortality but increased cognitive impairments, including attention function, making quality of life issues a crucial concern. This study enrolled nineteen breast cancer patients who were treated with standard chemotherapy within 6 months and 20 sex-matched healthy controls to investigate the brain effects of chemotherapy. All participants underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) with mean fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (mfALFF) analysis and were correlated with neuropsychological tests, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised (CAMS-R), and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), to explore the possible underlying mechanism of cognitive alternations. We found increased mfALFF over the frontoparietal lobe and decreased mfALFF over the occipital lobe in the cancer patients compared with the healthy controls; the altered brain regions may be associated with the dorsal attention network (DAN) and may be explained by a compensatory mechanism. Both MMSE and CAMS-R scores showed a positive correlation with mfALFF in the occipital lobe but a negative correlation in the frontoparietal lobe. By contrast, IES-R scores showed a positive correlation with mfALFF in the frontoparietal lobe but a negative correlation in the occipital lobe. These alterations are potentially related to the effects of both chemotherapy and psychological distress. Future research involving a larger sample size of patients with breast cancer is recommended. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

In the case of mutations in individual genes that cause them to be incorrectly spliced, engineered splicing factors can be introduced to correct splicing of these aberrant transcripts and reduce the effects of the disease phenotype. Mutations that occur in certain splicing factor genes themselves have been implicated in many cancers, particularly myelodysplastic syndromes. Small molecules that target splicing factors have been developed as therapies to preferentially induce apoptosis in these cancer cells. Specifically, drugs targeting the splicing factor SF3B1 have led to recent clinical trials.

Analysis of AA-reconstructed amplicons in a pan-cancer dataset reveals many novel properties of copy number amplifications in cancer. These findings support a model in which focal amplifications arise due to the formation and replication of extrachromosomal DNA. Applying AA to 68 viral-mediated cancer samples, we identify a large fraction of amplicons with specific structural signatures suggestive of hybrid, human-viral extrachromosomal DNA.

There have been many attempts to identify markers and key pathways induced throughout EMT but the process is complex and depends on the cancer type and tumour microenvironment. Here we used the colon cancer cell line HT29, which stably overexpressed Snail, the key transcription factor in early EMT, as a model for colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with a pro-metastatic phenotype. We investigated miRNA expression regulation during that phenotypic switching. We found that overexpression of Snail in HT29 cells triggered significant changes in individual miRNA levels but did not change the global efficiency of miRNA processing. Snail abundance repressed the expression of miR-192 and miR-194 and increased miR-205, let-7i and SNORD13 levels. These identified changes correlated with the reported transcriptomic alterations in Snail-overexpressing HT29 cells. We also investigated how Snail affected the miRNA content of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from HT29 cells. Our data suggest that the presence of Snail significantly alters the complex mRNA/miRNA interactions in the early steps of metastasis and also has an impact on the content of EVs released from HT29 cells. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

This retrospective case-control study compared patients who had lung cancer with PJP (n = 112) or without PJP (n = 336) matched according to age, sex, histopathology, and stage. PJP definition was based on (i) positive PCR or direct immunofluorescence results for pneumocystis, (ii) clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities that were consistent with a pneumonic process, and (iii) received targeted PJP treatment. The development of PJP was associated with radiotherapy (RTx), concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRTx), lymphopenia, and prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (20 mg of prednisolone equivalent per day for ≥3 weeks). Multivariate analysis revealed independent associations with prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06–3.63; p = 0.032) and CCRTx (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.27–3.43; p = 0.004). Steroid use was frequently related to RTx pneumonitis or esophagitis (29 patients, 43.3%). Prolonged high-dose steroid therapy and CCRTx were risk factors for PJP development among patients with lung cancer. As these patients had a poor prognosis, clinicians should consider PJP prophylaxis for high-risk patients with lung cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

We performed an in silico analysis to determine the concordance in the frequencies of actionable mutations and copy number alterations/aberrations (CNAs) in the two most common breast cancer histologies, invasive lobular and invasive ductal carcinoma. We found that targeted sequencing identified a larger number of mutational hotspots and clinically significant amplifications that would have been missed by WES and SNP arrays in many actionable genes such as PIK3CA, EGFR, AKT3, FGFR1, ERBB2, ERBB3 and ESR1. The striking differences between the number of mutational hotspots and CNAs generated from these platforms highlight a number of factors that should be considered in the interpretation of array and NGS-based genomic data for precision medicine.

Several oxaliplatin transporters were previously identified but their relative contributions to determining oxaliplatin tumour responses and gastrointestinal tumour cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin remains unclear. We studied clinical associations between tumour expression of oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes and patient response to oxaliplatin, then experimentally verified associations found with MRP2 in models of human gastrointestinal cancer. Among 18 oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes, MRP2 was the only one to be differentially expressed in the tumours of colorectal cancer patients who did or did not respond to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Over-expression of MRP2 (endogenously in HepG2 and PANC-1 cells, or induced by stable transfection of HEK293 cells) decreased oxaliplatin accumulation and cytotoxicity but those deficits were reversed by inhibition of MRP2 with myricetin or siRNA knockdown. Mice bearing subcutaneous HepG2 tumour xenografts were sensitised to oxaliplatin antitumour activity by concurrent myricetin treatment with little or no increase in toxicity. In conclusion, MRP2 limits oxaliplatin accumulation and response in human gastrointestinal cancer.

We compare optimized gene signatures for cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin responses in the same cell lines and validate each signature using data from patients with cancer. Supervised support vector machine learning is used to derive gene sets whose expression is related to the cell line GI50 values by backwards feature selection with cross-validation. Specific genes and functional pathways distinguishing sensitive from resistant cell lines are identified by contrasting signatures obtained at extreme and median GI50 thresholds. Ensembles of gene signatures at different thresholds are combined to reduce the dependence on specific GI50 values for predicting drug responses. The most accurate gene signatures for each platin are: cisplatin: BARD1, BCL2, BCL2L1, CDKN2C, FAAP24, FEN1, MAP3K1, MAPK13, MAPK3, NFKB1, NFKB2, SLC22A5, SLC31A2, TLR4, and TWIST1; carboplatin: AKT1, EIF3K, ERCC1, GNGT1, GSR, MTHFR, NEDD4L, NLRP1, NRAS, RAF1, SGK1, TIGD1, TP53, VEGFB, and VEGFC; and oxaliplatin: BRAF, FCGR2A, IGF1, MSH2, NAGK, NFE2L2, NQO1, PANK3, SLC47A1, SLCO1B1, and UGT1A1. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with bladder, ovarian, and colorectal cancer were used to test the cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin signatures, resulting in 71.0%, 60.2%, and 54.5% accuracies in predicting disease recurrence and 59%, 61%, and 72% accuracies in predicting remission, respectively. One cisplatin signature predicted 100% of recurrence in non-smoking patients with bladder cancer (57% disease-free; N = 19), and 79% recurrence in smokers (62% disease-free; N = 35).

MTH1 dephosphorylates oxidized nucleotides, thereby preventing their incorporation into DNA and protecting tumour cells from oxidative DNA damage. Inhibitors of MTH1 (TH588 and (S)-crizotinib) were shown to reduce cancer cell viability. However, the MTH1-dependency of the anti-cancer effects of these drugs has recently been questioned. Here, we have assessed anti-tumour effects of TH588 and (S)-crizotinib in patient-derived 3D colorectal cancer cultures. Hypoxia and reoxygenation – conditions that increase intracellular ROS levels – increased sensitivity to (S)-crizotinib, but not to TH588. (S)-crizotinib reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-MET and ErbB3 whereas TH588 induced a mitotic cell cycle arrest, which was not affected by adding ROS-modulating compounds. Furthermore, we show that both compounds induced DNA damage that could not be prevented by adding the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Moreover, adding ROS-modulating compounds did not alter the reduction in viability in response to TH588 and (S)-crizotinib. We conclude that TH588 and (S)-crizotinib have very clear and distinct anti-tumour effects in 3D colorectal cancer cultures, but that these effects most likely occur through distinct and ROS-independent mechanisms. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Iron deposits are a phenotypic trait of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Histological iron imaging and contrast-agent free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect these deposits, but their presence in human cancer, and correlation with immunotherapeutic response is largely untested. Here, primarily using these iron imaging approaches, we evaluated the spatial distribution of polarized macrophage populations containing high endogenous levels of iron in preclinical murine models and human breast cancer, and used them as metabolic biomarkers to correlate TAM infiltration with response to immunotherapy in preclinical trials. Macrophage-targeted inhibition of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) by immunotherapy was confirmed to inhibit macrophage accumulation and slow mammary tumor growth in mouse models while also reducing hemosiderin iron-laden TAM accumulation as measured by both iron histology and in vivo iron MRI (FeMRI). Spatial profiling of TAM iron deposit infiltration defined regions of maximal accumulation and response to the CSF1R inhibitor, and revealed differences between microenvironments of human cancer according to levels of polarized macrophage iron accumulation in stromal margins. We therefore demonstrate that iron deposition serves as an endogenous metabolic imaging biomarker of TAM infiltration in breast cancer that has high translational potential for evaluation of immunotherapeutic response. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "More than 50% of colon cancers bear mutations in p53, one of the most important tumor suppressors, and its family members p63 or p73 are expected to contribute to inhibiting the progression of colon cancers. The AP2 family also acts as a tumor suppressor. Here we found that p73 and AP2 are able to activate NEU4, a neuraminidase gene, which removes the terminal sialic acid residues from cancer-associated glycans. Under serum starvation, NEU4 was up-regulated and one of the NEU4 target glycans, sialyl Lewis X, was decreased, whereas p73 and AP2 were up-regulated. Sialyl Lewis X levels were not, however, decreased under starvation conditions in p73- or AP2-knockdown cells. p53 and AP2 underwent protein-protein interactions, exerting synergistic effects to activate p21, and interaction of p53 with AP2 was lost in cells expressing the L350P mutation of p53. The homologous residues in p63 and p73 are L423 and L377, respectively. The synergistic effect of p53/p63 with AP2 to activate genes was lost with the L350P/L423P mutation in p53/p63, but p73 bearing the L377P mutation was able to interact with AP2 and exerted its normal synergistic effects. We propose that p73 and AP2 synergistically activate the NEU4 promoter in colon cancer cells. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Nanoparticles prepared by single emulsion method had a size of less than 300 nm with 70.7 ± 3.9% reaction yield and 26.4 ± 1.1% Hsp loading capacity. Treatment of C6 glioma cells with HspNPs for 24 and 48 h resulted in dose- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability, with approximate IC50 of 28 and 21 μg/mL, respectively (p = .036 for 24 h, p = .025 for 48 h). The percentage of PCNA positive cells decreased to 20% and 10%, respectively, for Hsp- and HspNP-treated cells at concentration of 100 µg/mL. Treatment with increasing concentrations of HspNPs (25, 50, 75 and 100 µg/mL) resulted in 9.1-, 7-, 12.5- and 12.7-fold in increase in apoptotic cell number. Optimum doses of Hsp and HspNPs were found to increase oxidative damage in C6 glioma cells. MDA levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were found to be significantly elevated at 75 and 100 µg/mL exposure concentration of HspNPs with (p = .002) and (p = .018), respectively for 48-h treatment. The results obtained with this study showed biocompatible polymeric nanoparticle systems has great advantages to enhance anti-cancer activity and poor solubility of therapeutic agents. Overall our findings suggest that Hsp-loaded PLGA nanoparticle systems showed significant anti-cancer activity and HspNPs could be used as promising novel anti-cancer agent." ;

GO exhibits pH-dependent fluorescence emission in the visible/near-infrared, providing a possibility of molecular imaging and pH-sensing. It is also water soluble and has a substantial platform for functionalization, allowing for the delivery of multiple therapeutics. GO physical properties are modified to enhance cellular internalization, producing fluorescent nanoflakes with low (<15%) cytotoxicity at the imaging concentrations of 15 μg/mL. As a result, at lower flake sizes GO rapidly internalizes into HeLa cells with the following 70% fluorescence based clearance at 24 h, assessed by its characteristic emission in red/near-IR. pH-dependence of GO emission is utilized to provide the sensing of acidic extracellular environments of cancer cells. The results demonstrate diminishing green/red (550/630 nm) fluorescence intensity ratios for HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells in comparison to HEK-293 healthy cells suggesting a potential use of GO as a non-invasive optical sensor for cancer microenvironments.

There have been many attempts to identify markers and key pathways induced throughout EMT but the process is complex and depends on the cancer type and tumour microenvironment. Here we used the colon cancer cell line HT29, which stably overexpressed Snail, the key transcription factor in early EMT, as a model for colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with a pro-metastatic phenotype. We investigated miRNA expression regulation during that phenotypic switching. We found that overexpression of Snail in HT29 cells triggered significant changes in individual miRNA levels but did not change the global efficiency of miRNA processing. Snail abundance repressed the expression of miR-192 and miR-194 and increased miR-205, let-7i and SNORD13 levels. These identified changes correlated with the reported transcriptomic alterations in Snail-overexpressing HT29 cells. We also investigated how Snail affected the miRNA content of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from HT29 cells. Our data suggest that the presence of Snail significantly alters the complex mRNA/miRNA interactions in the early steps of metastasis and also has an impact on the content of EVs released from HT29 cells. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

This retrospective case-control study compared patients who had lung cancer with PJP (n = 112) or without PJP (n = 336) matched according to age, sex, histopathology, and stage. PJP definition was based on (i) positive PCR or direct immunofluorescence results for pneumocystis, (ii) clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities that were consistent with a pneumonic process, and (iii) received targeted PJP treatment. The development of PJP was associated with radiotherapy (RTx), concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRTx), lymphopenia, and prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (20 mg of prednisolone equivalent per day for ≥3 weeks). Multivariate analysis revealed independent associations with prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06–3.63; p = 0.032) and CCRTx (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.27–3.43; p = 0.004). Steroid use was frequently related to RTx pneumonitis or esophagitis (29 patients, 43.3%). Prolonged high-dose steroid therapy and CCRTx were risk factors for PJP development among patients with lung cancer. As these patients had a poor prognosis, clinicians should consider PJP prophylaxis for high-risk patients with lung cancer. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

We performed an in silico analysis to determine the concordance in the frequencies of actionable mutations and copy number alterations/aberrations (CNAs) in the two most common breast cancer histologies, invasive lobular and invasive ductal carcinoma. We found that targeted sequencing identified a larger number of mutational hotspots and clinically significant amplifications that would have been missed by WES and SNP arrays in many actionable genes such as PIK3CA, EGFR, AKT3, FGFR1, ERBB2, ERBB3 and ESR1. The striking differences between the number of mutational hotspots and CNAs generated from these platforms highlight a number of factors that should be considered in the interpretation of array and NGS-based genomic data for precision medicine.

Several oxaliplatin transporters were previously identified but their relative contributions to determining oxaliplatin tumour responses and gastrointestinal tumour cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin remains unclear. We studied clinical associations between tumour expression of oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes and patient response to oxaliplatin, then experimentally verified associations found with MRP2 in models of human gastrointestinal cancer. Among 18 oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes, MRP2 was the only one to be differentially expressed in the tumours of colorectal cancer patients who did or did not respond to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Over-expression of MRP2 (endogenously in HepG2 and PANC-1 cells, or induced by stable transfection of HEK293 cells) decreased oxaliplatin accumulation and cytotoxicity but those deficits were reversed by inhibition of MRP2 with myricetin or siRNA knockdown. Mice bearing subcutaneous HepG2 tumour xenografts were sensitised to oxaliplatin antitumour activity by concurrent myricetin treatment with little or no increase in toxicity. In conclusion, MRP2 limits oxaliplatin accumulation and response in human gastrointestinal cancer.

We compare optimized gene signatures for cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin responses in the same cell lines and validate each signature using data from patients with cancer. Supervised support vector machine learning is used to derive gene sets whose expression is related to the cell line GI50 values by backwards feature selection with cross-validation. Specific genes and functional pathways distinguishing sensitive from resistant cell lines are identified by contrasting signatures obtained at extreme and median GI50 thresholds. Ensembles of gene signatures at different thresholds are combined to reduce the dependence on specific GI50 values for predicting drug responses. The most accurate gene signatures for each platin are: cisplatin: BARD1, BCL2, BCL2L1, CDKN2C, FAAP24, FEN1, MAP3K1, MAPK13, MAPK3, NFKB1, NFKB2, SLC22A5, SLC31A2, TLR4, and TWIST1; carboplatin: AKT1, EIF3K, ERCC1, GNGT1, GSR, MTHFR, NEDD4L, NLRP1, NRAS, RAF1, SGK1, TIGD1, TP53, VEGFB, and VEGFC; and oxaliplatin: BRAF, FCGR2A, IGF1, MSH2, NAGK, NFE2L2, NQO1, PANK3, SLC47A1, SLCO1B1, and UGT1A1. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with bladder, ovarian, and colorectal cancer were used to test the cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin signatures, resulting in 71.0%, 60.2%, and 54.5% accuracies in predicting disease recurrence and 59%, 61%, and 72% accuracies in predicting remission, respectively. One cisplatin signature predicted 100% of recurrence in non-smoking patients with bladder cancer (57% disease-free; N = 19), and 79% recurrence in smokers (62% disease-free; N = 35).

MTH1 dephosphorylates oxidized nucleotides, thereby preventing their incorporation into DNA and protecting tumour cells from oxidative DNA damage. Inhibitors of MTH1 (TH588 and (S)-crizotinib) were shown to reduce cancer cell viability. However, the MTH1-dependency of the anti-cancer effects of these drugs has recently been questioned. Here, we have assessed anti-tumour effects of TH588 and (S)-crizotinib in patient-derived 3D colorectal cancer cultures. Hypoxia and reoxygenation – conditions that increase intracellular ROS levels – increased sensitivity to (S)-crizotinib, but not to TH588. (S)-crizotinib reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-MET and ErbB3 whereas TH588 induced a mitotic cell cycle arrest, which was not affected by adding ROS-modulating compounds. Furthermore, we show that both compounds induced DNA damage that could not be prevented by adding the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Moreover, adding ROS-modulating compounds did not alter the reduction in viability in response to TH588 and (S)-crizotinib. We conclude that TH588 and (S)-crizotinib have very clear and distinct anti-tumour effects in 3D colorectal cancer cultures, but that these effects most likely occur through distinct and ROS-independent mechanisms. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Iron deposits are a phenotypic trait of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Histological iron imaging and contrast-agent free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect these deposits, but their presence in human cancer, and correlation with immunotherapeutic response is largely untested. Here, primarily using these iron imaging approaches, we evaluated the spatial distribution of polarized macrophage populations containing high endogenous levels of iron in preclinical murine models and human breast cancer, and used them as metabolic biomarkers to correlate TAM infiltration with response to immunotherapy in preclinical trials. Macrophage-targeted inhibition of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) by immunotherapy was confirmed to inhibit macrophage accumulation and slow mammary tumor growth in mouse models while also reducing hemosiderin iron-laden TAM accumulation as measured by both iron histology and in vivo iron MRI (FeMRI). Spatial profiling of TAM iron deposit infiltration defined regions of maximal accumulation and response to the CSF1R inhibitor, and revealed differences between microenvironments of human cancer according to levels of polarized macrophage iron accumulation in stromal margins. We therefore demonstrate that iron deposition serves as an endogenous metabolic imaging biomarker of TAM infiltration in breast cancer that has high translational potential for evaluation of immunotherapeutic response. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "More than 50% of colon cancers bear mutations in p53, one of the most important tumor suppressors, and its family members p63 or p73 are expected to contribute to inhibiting the progression of colon cancers. The AP2 family also acts as a tumor suppressor. Here we found that p73 and AP2 are able to activate NEU4, a neuraminidase gene, which removes the terminal sialic acid residues from cancer-associated glycans. Under serum starvation, NEU4 was up-regulated and one of the NEU4 target glycans, sialyl Lewis X, was decreased, whereas p73 and AP2 were up-regulated. Sialyl Lewis X levels were not, however, decreased under starvation conditions in p73- or AP2-knockdown cells. p53 and AP2 underwent protein-protein interactions, exerting synergistic effects to activate p21, and interaction of p53 with AP2 was lost in cells expressing the L350P mutation of p53. The homologous residues in p63 and p73 are L423 and L377, respectively. The synergistic effect of p53/p63 with AP2 to activate genes was lost with the L350P/L423P mutation in p53/p63, but p73 bearing the L377P mutation was able to interact with AP2 and exerted its normal synergistic effects. We propose that p73 and AP2 synergistically activate the NEU4 promoter in colon cancer cells. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Nanoparticles prepared by single emulsion method had a size of less than 300 nm with 70.7 ± 3.9% reaction yield and 26.4 ± 1.1% Hsp loading capacity. Treatment of C6 glioma cells with HspNPs for 24 and 48 h resulted in dose- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability, with approximate IC50 of 28 and 21 μg/mL, respectively (p = .036 for 24 h, p = .025 for 48 h). The percentage of PCNA positive cells decreased to 20% and 10%, respectively, for Hsp- and HspNP-treated cells at concentration of 100 µg/mL. Treatment with increasing concentrations of HspNPs (25, 50, 75 and 100 µg/mL) resulted in 9.1-, 7-, 12.5- and 12.7-fold in increase in apoptotic cell number. Optimum doses of Hsp and HspNPs were found to increase oxidative damage in C6 glioma cells. MDA levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were found to be significantly elevated at 75 and 100 µg/mL exposure concentration of HspNPs with (p = .002) and (p = .018), respectively for 48-h treatment. The results obtained with this study showed biocompatible polymeric nanoparticle systems has great advantages to enhance anti-cancer activity and poor solubility of therapeutic agents. Overall our findings suggest that Hsp-loaded PLGA nanoparticle systems showed significant anti-cancer activity and HspNPs could be used as promising novel anti-cancer agent." ;

GO exhibits pH-dependent fluorescence emission in the visible/near-infrared, providing a possibility of molecular imaging and pH-sensing. It is also water soluble and has a substantial platform for functionalization, allowing for the delivery of multiple therapeutics. GO physical properties are modified to enhance cellular internalization, producing fluorescent nanoflakes with low (<15%) cytotoxicity at the imaging concentrations of 15 μg/mL. As a result, at lower flake sizes GO rapidly internalizes into HeLa cells with the following 70% fluorescence based clearance at 24 h, assessed by its characteristic emission in red/near-IR. pH-dependence of GO emission is utilized to provide the sensing of acidic extracellular environments of cancer cells. The results demonstrate diminishing green/red (550/630 nm) fluorescence intensity ratios for HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells in comparison to HEK-293 healthy cells suggesting a potential use of GO as a non-invasive optical sensor for cancer microenvironments. The results of this work demonstrate the potential of GO as a novel multifunctional platform for therapeutic delivery, biological imaging and cancer sensing. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Patients with primary cervical cancer and newly diagnosed were selected from ten different cancer specialist hospitals of Malaysia. Patients’ demographic and clinical data were obtained for the prognostic analysis. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate patients’ survival time (CSS and OS) with DM status and values were compared using the log-rank test. A total of 19,785 newly diagnosed CC patients were registered during 2010–2016, among them only 16,946 (85.6%) with primary CC tumor. There was no difference in treatment modality between DM and non-DM patients. However intergroup assessment showed that type 2DM have significantly higher rate of mortality in both overall mortality (28.3%) and CC-specific (11.7%) as compared to Type 1DM (17.3%; 5.5%) and non DM patients (12.7%; 9.1%) (p < 0.001). Within group assessments showed that Type 2DM patients have better quality of life (mean 7.13 ± 3.67) (p < 0.001) and less distress levels (mean 2.41 ± 0.63) (p < 0.011) as compared to type1 DM (meant 10.54 ± 2.11; 3.19 ± 1.07).

In order to tackle cancer heterogeneity and comply with the data dimensionality, a number of network and pathway approaches were invented but rarely systematically applied to this task. We propose a new method, called NEAmarker, for finding sensitive and robust biomarkers at the pathway level. scores from network enrichment analysis transform the original space of altered genes into a lower-dimensional space of pathways. These dimensions are then correlated with phenotype variables. The method was first tested using in vitro data from three anti-cancer drug screens and then on clinical data of The Cancer Genome Atlas. It proved superior to the single-gene and alternative enrichment analyses in terms of (1) universal applicability to different data types with a possibility of cross-platform integration, (2) consistency of the discovered correlates between independent drug screens, and (3) ability to explain differential survival of treated patients. Our new screen of anti-cancer compounds validated the performance of multivariate models of drug sensitivity. The previously proposed methods of enrichment analysis could achieve comparable levels of performance in certain tests. However, only our method could discover predictors of both in vitro response and patient survival given administration of the same drug. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

SPIONs entrapped in the core of the nanocomplex may act as a hyperthermia agent and generate localized heat upon excitation with an alternating magnetic field (AMF), thus enabling a thermo-chemotherapy strategy for cancer treatment. Accordingly, the cytotoxic effect and the mode of cell death triggered by the nanocomplex in combination with AMF were evaluated on two different cancer cell lines with various folate receptor (FR) expression levels, including KB nasopharyngeal cancer cells overexpressing FRs as the model and MCF-7 breast cancer cells with low level of FRs as the blank sample. The obtained results showed that KB cell death was greater than the cell death observed in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, a majority of cell death in both cell lines were related to apoptosis when the folate-modified nanocomplex was used instated of the non-folate-modified nanocomplex. Therefore, functionalizing the nanocomplex with folate modulated the response to thermo-chemotherapy by shifting the cell death pathways toward apoptosis." ;

We examined TILs grades of pretreatment cancer tissue specimens and residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab and determined the predictive utility of the TILs grade in pathological complete response (pCR) and the prognostic power of TILs in HER2-positive breast cancer. This cohort study included 128 HER2-positive breast cancer who received NAC with trastuzumab. TILs grading of the tumor stroma in pretreatment biopsy specimens and residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab was categorized as low, intermediate, and high based on the criteria of the International Working Group. In current study, the pCR rate was 64.8%, and the Relapse-free survival (RFS) was significantly worse in the non-pCR group than in the pCR group. The pCR rate correlated with the TILs grade in pretreatment tumors. In 45 non-pCR patients, TILs grade was higher in the residual tumors than in the pretreatment tumors. The RFS was significantly better in residual tumors with high TILs grade than those with low TILs grade (p = 0.033). In conclusion, assessment of the TILs grade in residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab might be necessary to determine patients with good prognosis among those who do not achieve pCR. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Most targeting strategies of anticancer drug delivery systems (DDSs) rely on the surface functionalization of nanocarriers with specific ligands, which trigger the internalization in cancer cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The endocytosis implies the entrapment of DDSs in acidic vesicles (endosomes and lysosomes) and their eventual ejection by exocytosis. This process, intrinsic to eukaryotic cells, is one of the main drawbacks of DDSs because it reduces the drug bioavailability in the intracellular environment. The escape of DDSs from the acidic vesicles is, therefore, crucial to enhance the therapeutic performance at low drug dose. To this end, we developed a multifunctionalized DDS that combines high specificity towards cancer cells with endosomal escape capabilities. Doxorubicin-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles were functionalized with polyethylenimine, a polymer commonly used to induce endosomal rupture, and hyaluronic acid, which binds to CD44 receptors, overexpressed in cancer cells. We show irrefutable proof that the developed DDS can escape the endosomal pathway upon polymeric functionalization. Interestingly, the combination of the two polymers resulted in higher endosomal escape efficiency than the polyethylenimine coating alone. Hyaluronic acid additionally provides the system with cancer targeting capability and enzymatically controlled drug release. Thanks to this multifunctionality, the engineered DDS had cytotoxicity comparable to the pure drug whilst displaying high specificity towards cancer cells. The polymeric engineering here developed enhances the performance of DDS at low drug dose, holding great potential for anticancer therapeutic applications. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The use of oncolytic viruses (OVs) for cancer treatment is emerging as a successful strategy that combines the direct, targeted killing of the cancer with the induction of a long-lasting anti-tumor immune response. Using multiple aggressive murine models of triple-negative breast cancer, we have recently demonstrated that the early administration of oncolytic Maraba virus (MRB) prior to surgical resection of the primary tumor is sufficient to minimize the metastatic burden, protect against tumor rechallenge, cure a fraction of the mice and sensitize refractory tumors to immune checkpoint blockade without the need for further treatment. Here, we apply our surgical model to other OVs: Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Adenovirus (Ad), Reovirus (Reo) and Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and show that all of the tested OVs could positively change the outcome of the treated animals. The growth of the primary and secondary tumors was differently affected by the various OVs and most of the viruses conferred survival benefits in this neoadjuvant setting despite the absence of direct treatment following rechallenge. This study establishes that OV-therapy confers long-term protection when administered in the pre-operative window of opportunity. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase is overexpressed in approximately 15–20% of breast tumors and associated with aggressive disease and poor clinical outcome. p130Cas represents a nodal scaffold protein regulating cell survival, migration and proliferation in normal and pathological contexts. p130Cas overexpression in ErbB2 human breast cancer correlates with poor prognosis and metastasis formation. Recent data indicate that p130Cas association to ErbB2 protects ErbB2 from degradation, thus enhancing tumorigenesis. Therefore, inhibiting p130Cas/ErbB2 interaction might represent a new therapeutic strategy to target breast cancer. Here we demonstrate by performing Molecular Modeling, Molecular Dynamics, dot blot, ELISA and fluorescence quenching experiments, that p130Cas binds directly to ErbB2. Then, by structure-based virtual screening, we identified two potential inhibitors of p130Cas/ErbB2 interaction. Their experimental validation was performed in vitro and in ErbB2-positive breast cancer cellular models. The results highlight that both compounds interfere with p130Cas/ErbB2 binding and significantly affect cell proliferation and sensitivity to Trastuzumab. Overall, this study identifies p130Cas/ErbB2 complex as a potential breast cancer target revealing new therapeutic perspectives for protein-protein interaction (PPI). © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Gastric cancer (GC) ranks as the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, and approximately 42% of all cases diagnosed each year worldwide are diagnosed in China. A large number of clinical applications have revealed that Trametes robiniophila Μurr. (Huaier) exhibits an anti-tumour effect. However, loss of the bioactive components of Huaier during the extraction procedure with water is unavoidable, and the underlying mechanism of the anti-cancer effect of Huaier remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer effect of Huaier n-butanol extract, which contained 51.4% total flavonoids, on HGC27, MGC803, and AGS human GC cell lines in vitro. At a low concentration, Huaier n-butanol extract inhibited the growth of these GC cell types, induced cell cycle arrest and reduced cell metastasis. Moreover, Huaier n-butanol extract suppressed the c-Myc-Bmi1 signalling pathway, and overexpression of Bmi1 reversed the effects of Huaier n-butanol extract on GC cells. Thus, our findings indicate that Huaier n-butanol extract suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of GC cells via a c-Myc-Bmi1-mediated approach, providing a new perspective for our understanding of the anti-tumour effects of Huaier. These results suggest that Huaier n-butanol extract could be an attractive therapeutic adjuvant for the treatment of human GC. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

In the present study, we screened the anticancer potential of supernatant metabolites from eight native haloarchaeal strains obtained from a culture collection in Iran. Five human cancer cell lines including breast, lung, prostate and also human fibroblast cells as the normal control were used in the present study. Moreover, to evaluate the anti-tumor effect of the selected supernatant, inhibition of sphere formation and tumor development was assessed in-vitro and in-vivo, respectively. Among all strains, supernatant metabolites from Halobacterium salinarum IBRC M10715 had the most potent cytotoxic effect on prostate cancer cell lines (IC50 = 0.5 mg/mL) without any effects on normal cells. It significantly increased both early and late apoptosis (about 11% and 9%, respectively) in the androgen-dependent PC3 cell line, reduced sphere formation ability of DU145 and PC3 cells with down-regulation of SOX2 gene expression. Furthermore, our results revealed that tumors developed in nude mice significantly shrank post intratumor injection of metabolites of the haloarchaeal strain. In conclusion, we suggested here for the first time that supernatant metabolites from Halobacterium salinarum IBRC M10715 could be a novel component against prostate cancer in-vitro and in-vivo with remarkable reduction in stem-like properties of tumor. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

The main HNSCC risk factors are tobacco, excessive alcohol use, and the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV positive (+) cancers are etiologically different from other HNSCC and often show better prognosis. The current knowledge regarding HNSCC miRNA profiles is still incomplete especially in the context of HPV+ cancer. Thus, we analyzed 61 freshly collected primary oral (OSCC) and oropharyngeal (OPSCC) SCC samples. HPV DNA and RNA was found in 21% cases. The Illumina whole-genome small-RNA profiling by next-generation sequencing was done on 22 samples and revealed 7 specific miRNAs to HPV+ OSCC, 77 to HPV+ OPSCC, and additional 3 shared with both; 51 miRNAs were specific to HPV− OPSCC, 62 to HPV− OSCC, and 31 shared with both. The results for 9 miRNAs (miR-9, -21, -29a, -100, -106b, -143 and -145) were assessed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction on the whole study population. The data was additionally confirmed by reanalyzing publicly available miRNA sequencing Cancer Genome Atlas consortium (TCGA) HNSCC data. Cell signaling pathway analysis revealed differences between HPV+ and HPV− HNSCC. Our findings compared with literature data revealed extensive heterogeneity of miRNA deregulation with only several miRNAs consistently affected, and miR-9 being the most likely HPV related miRNA. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Development of combined therapies constitutes an effective strategy to inhibit cancer cells and prevent the emergence of drug resistance. For this purpose, we investigated the anti-tumoral effect of thirteen phenolic compounds, from the Tunisian quince Cydonia oblonga Miller, alone or combined to 5-FU, on the human 5-FU-resistant LS174-R colon cancer cells in comparison to parental cells. Our results showed that only Kaempferol was able to chemo-sensitize 5-FU-resistant LS174-R cells. This phenolic compound combined with 5-FU exerted synergistic inhibitory effect on cell viability. This combination enhanced the apoptosis and induced cell cycle arrest of both chemo-resistant and sensitive cells through impacting the expression levels of different cellular effectors. Kaempferol also blocked the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and modulated the expression of JAK/STAT3, MAPK, PI3K/AKT and NF-κB. In silico docking analysis suggested that the potent anti-tumoral effect of Kaempferol, compared to its two analogs (Kaempferol 3-O-glucoside and Kampferol 3-O-rutinoside), can be explained by the absence of glucosyl groups. Overall, our data propose Kaempferol as a potential chemotherapeutic agent to be used alone or in combination with 5-FU to overcome colon cancer drug resistance. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

Considering the high prevalence and mortality rate of colorectal cancer, in this study we tried to design and validate a standard printed form and evaluate oncologists’ and nurses’ adherence to this form. This cross-sectional study was performed in Omid hospital, Mashhad, Iran from January 2015 to October 2015. A Chemotherapy form including various demographic and clinical parameters and approved chemotherapy regimens for colorectal cancer was designed by the clinical pharmacist and validated by clinical oncologists working in this center. All eligible patients admitted in this center during this period of time were included in the study. Adherence of the oncologists and nurses to this form and probable medication errors were identified by the pharmacy student. Sixty-seven patients with colorectal cancer and a total of 251 chemotherapy courses were evaluated. All patients received regimens compatible with developed form but in 206 courses (98.56%) of chemotherapy dosing error happened and in most of cases patients received lower than calculated dose (37.8%). Three errors occurred in administration step by nurses which they infused the medication in shorter than recommended duration. In general, oncologists’ adherence with developed form for chemotherapy of colorectal cancer was relatively high, except in dose calculation. Avoiding from rounding the calculated medications’ doses and precise calculation of patients’ body surface area can prevent most of medication errors and reduce risk of adverse drug reaction occurrence. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

Nevertheless, the importance of transfusion timing is still unclear. The primary purpose of this study is to appraise whether the receipt of intraoperative blood transfusion (BT) differ from postoperative BT in regards to cancer outcomes in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients treated with nephrectomy. Data on 1168 patients with RCC, who underwent radical or partial nephrectomy as primary therapy between 1988–2013 were analyzed. PBT was defined as transfusion of allogeneic red blood cells (RBC) during surgery or the postsurgical period. Survival was analyzed and compared using the Kaplan–Meier method with the log-rank test. Of 1168 patients, 198 patients (16.9%) received a PBT. Including 117 intraoperative BT and 81 postoperative BT. Only 21 (10.6%) patients required both intraoperative and postoperative BT. On multivariate analyses, receipt of PBT was associated with significantly worse local disease recurrence (HR: 2.4; P = 0.017), metastatic progression (HR: 2.7; P = 0.005), cancer-specific mortality (HR: 3.5; P = 0.002) and all-cause mortality (HR: 2.1; P = 0.005). Nevertheless, postoperative BT was not independently associated with increased risk of local recurrence (p = 0.1), metastatic progression (P = 0.16) or kidney cancer death (P = 0.63), yet did significantly increase the risk of overall mortality (HR: 2.6; P = 0.004).

For this reason novel therapies accounting for PDAC peculiarities, such as the relevant stromal reaction, are urgently needed. Here adipose mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (AD-MSC) have been armed to constantly release a soluble trimeric and multimeric variant of the known anti-cancer TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (sTRAIL). This cancer gene therapy strategy was in vitro challenged demonstrating that sTRAIL was thermally stable and able to induce apoptosis in the PDAC lines BxPC-3, MIA PaCa-2 and against primary PDAC cells. sTRAIL released by AD-MSC relocated into the tumor stroma was able to significantly counteract tumor growth in vivo with a significant reduction in tumor size, in cytokeratin-7+ cells and by an anti-angiogenic effect. In parallel, histology on PDAC specimens form patients (n = 19) was performed to investigate the levels of TRAIL DR4, DR5 and OPG receptors generating promising insights on the possible clinical translation of our approach. These results indicate that adipose MSC can very efficiently vehicle a novel TRAIL variant opening unexplored opportunities for PDAC treatment. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Malignant melanoma is one of the untreatable cancers in which conventional therapeutic strategies, including chemotherapy, are hardly effective. Therefore, identification of novel therapeutic targets involved in melanoma progression is urgently needed for developing effective therapeutic methods. Overexpression of interleukin-13 receptor α2 (IL13Rα2) is observed in several cancer types including glioma and pancreatic cancer. Although IL13Rα2 is implicated in the progression of various types of cancer, its expression and roles in the malignant melanoma have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we showed that IL13Rα2 was expressed in approximately 7.5% melanoma patients. While IL13Rα2 expression in human melanoma cells decreased their proliferation in vitro, it promoted in vivo tumour growth and angiogenesis in melanoma xenograft mouse model. We also found that the expression of amphiregulin, a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, was correlated with IL13Rα2 expression in cultured melanoma cells, xenograft tumour tissues and melanoma clinical samples. Furthermore, expression of amphiregulin promoted tumour growth, implicating causal relationship between the expression of IL13Rα2 and amphiregulin. These results suggest that IL13Rα2 enhances tumorigenicity by inducing angiogenesis in malignant melanoma, and serves as a potential therapeutic target of malignant melanoma. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

However, its prognostic value and the underlying mechanism in lung cancer remains unclear. Herein we evaluated the expression of PKD2 in lung adenocarcinoma and investigated its relationship with EMT. GSEA, TCGA and K-M plotter database were applied and revealed that high PKD2 expression predicted poor outcome and related with lymph nodes metastasis in lung cancer. IHC and qRT-PCR were performed and found PKD2 was elevated in lung adenocarcinoma and negatively related with OS (p = 0.015), PFS (p = 0.006) and the level of E-cadherin (p = 0.021). Experiment in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines demonstrated up-regulation of PKD2 led to high expression of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vim, mmp9 et al.) and EMT transcription factors(zeb1, twist, snail), and the results were reversed when PKD2 was knocked down. Further investigation showed that abrogation of PKD2 inhibited A549 cell migration, invasion, proliferation and induced cell arrest in G2/M phase. We concluded that high expression of PKD2 was associated with poor prognosis and cancer progression in lung adenocarcinoma patients by promoting EMT. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

We showed for the first time that Raman imaging can be used to distinguish successfully between glycosylated and nonglycosylated proteins in normal and cancer tissue. Thousands of protein, lipid and glycan species exist in cells and tissues and their metabolism is monitored via numerous pathways, networks and methods. The metabolism can change in response to cellular environment alterations, such as development of a disease. Measuring such alterations and understanding the pathways involved are crucial to fully understand cellular metabolism in cancer development. In this paper Raman markers of glycogen, glycosaminoglycan, chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate proteoglycan were identified based on their vibrational signatures. High spatial resolution of Raman imaging combined with chemometrics allows separation of individual species from many chemical components present in each cell. We have found that metabolism of proteins, lipids and glycans is markedly deregulated in breast (adenocarcinoma) and brain (medulloblastoma) tumors. We have identified two glycoforms in the normal breast tissue and the malignant brain tissue in contrast to the breast cancer tissue where only one glycoform has been identified. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Very recently, we postulated that the incorporation of citral into nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC-Citral) improves solubility and delivery of the citral without toxic effects in vivo. Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate anti-cancer effects of NLC-Citral in MDA MB-231 cells in vitro through the Annexin V, cell cycle, JC-1 and fluorometric assays. Additionally, this study is aimed to effects of NLC-Citral in reducing the tumor weight and size in 4T1 induced murine breast cancer model. Results showed that NLC-Citral induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest in MDA MB-231 cells. Furthermore, a prominent anti-metastatic ability of NLC-Citral was demonstrated in vitro using scratch, migration and invasion assays. A significant reduction of migrated and invaded cells was observed in the NLC-Citral treated MDA MB-231 cells. To further evaluate the apoptotic and anti-metastatic mechanism of NLC-Citral at the molecular level, microarray-based gene expression and proteomic profiling were conducted. Based on the result obtained, NLC-Citral was found to regulate several important signaling pathways related to cancer development such as apoptosis, cell cycle, and metastasis signaling pathways. Additionally, gene expression analysis was validated through the targeted RNA sequencing and real-time polymerase chain reaction. In conclusion, the NLC-Citral inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells in vitro, majorly through the induction of apoptosis, anti-metastasis, anti-angiogenesis potentials, and reducing the tumor weight and size without altering the therapeutic effects of citral. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The incidence of developing cancer should increase with the body mass, yet is not the case, a conundrum referred to as Peto’s paradox. Elephants have a lower incidence of cancer suggesting that these animals have probably evolved different ways to protect themselves against the disease. The paradox is worth revisiting with the realization that most mammals encode an endogenous APOBEC3 cytidine deaminase capable of mutating single stranded DNA. Indeed, the mutagenic activity of some APOBEC3 enzymes has been shown to introduce somatic mutations into genomic DNA. These enzymes are now recognized as causal agent responsible for the accumulation of CG- > TA transitions and DNA breaks leading to chromosomal rearrangements in human cancer genomes. Here, we identified an elephant A3Z1 gene, related to human APOBEC3A and showed that it could efficiently deaminate cytidine, 5-methylcytidine and produce DNA breaks leading to massive apoptosis, similar to other mammalian APOBEC3A enzymes where body mass varies by up to four orders of magnitude. Consequently, it could be considered that eAZ1 might contribute to cancer in elephants in a manner similar to their proposed role in humans. If so, eAZ1 might be particularly well regulated to counter Peto’s paradox. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

The cells and mitochondria were isolated from cancerous and non-cancerous ovarian tissues and exposed to IC 50 concentration of F1 fraction for evaluation of mitochondrial and cellular parameters. Our results showed that F1 fraction of T. coronatus crude extract significantly induced toxic effects only in the cancerous ovarian mitochondria, including increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, mitochondrial swelling, and cytochrome c release.Flow-cytometry analysis demonstrated that F1 fraction of T. coronatus progressively induced apoptosis and necrosis only on EOC but not non-cancerous cells.

Biotin-PEG-PCL polymers have been used for targeted drug delivery to cancer, as well as to improve the pharmacokinetics of the drug and reduce its effects. In this study, biotin-conjugated copolymers were fabricated with polymerization of the ring opening method and the properties of copolymer and nanoparticles were investigated using various techniques. The toxicity of artemisinin and its nanoparticles have been investigated on MCF-7 and normal HFF2 cells. The results showed that the encapsulation efficacy of artemisinin in nanoparticles was 45.5 ± 0.41%. The release profile of the drug indicates that the release is slow and controlled and is approximately pH dependent. The results of artemisinin cell culture on human breast cancer cells showed that biotin-PEG-PCL nanoparticles had an inhibitory effect on MCF-7 cells and had no toxic effects on HFF2 cells. Anticancer activity in vivo in the 4T1 breast cancer model showed that tumour volumes were decreased up 40 mm3 by ART-loaded micelles and 76 mm3 by free ART, compared to the control group (2150 mm). In vivo results showed that this formulation significantly increases the accumulation of substances in the tumours. Therefore, the molecular formulation of ART-based copolymers can be a desirable process for cancer treatment purposes. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group." ;

Previous reports have shown the effectiveness of BP in treating cancer diseases. However, BP has no targeting capacity towards specific cancer cells. To improve treatment efficiency and reduce the dose of BP used in cancer treatment, targeting-based approaches should be developed. In the present study, we used riboflavin-5′-phosphate (RFMP) immobilized iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4 MNPs) as carriers for BP to treat cancer cell lines derived from liver, prostate and breast. These model cancer cells overexpress riboflavin receptors on their cell membrane and are also sensitive to BP treatment. Thus, BP-binding free RFMP on MNPs can be used as probes to target these model cells, whereas BP can be readily released on target cancer cells. Cell viability was twofold lower by using Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs immobilized with BP than that achieved by using free-form BP at a similar amount. Moreover, BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs have no apparent harmful effects on non-target cells. In addition, we evaluated the level of cysteine-aspartic acid protease 3 (caspase 3) in the resultant cell lysate obtained after treatment by BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs to demonstrate that apoptosis is mainly involved in the growth inhibition of target cells. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Patients with laryngeal cancer (ICD-10: C32) between 2009 and 2010 were retrospectively identified and tracked until 2015 using the Korean Health Insurance claims database. During the seven-year follow-up period, 5,322 subjects were newly diagnosed with larynx cancer. The mean age of people with laryngeal cancer was much higher than those without (63.29 vs. 47.7 years, p < 0.0001), and the incidence of larynx cancer in men was much higher than that in women (93.16% vs. 6.84%, p < 0.0001). Age, gender, smoking status, alcohol intake, and exercise-adjusted hazard ratios indicated that participants with MetS had a 1.13-fold higher hazard of having larynx cancer than those without MetS. The number of MetS components was a strong risk factor for laryngeal cancer with a higher risk estimate of this cancer in both ex- and current smokers as well as people who have never smoked. MetS was found to be an independent risk factor for the incidence of laryngeal cancer.

        fabio:abstract    "Chromosome changes are one of the hallmarks of human malignancies. Chromosomal rearrangement is frequent in human cancers. One of the consequences of chromosomal rearrangement is gene fusions in the cancer genome. We have previously identified a panel of fusion genes in aggressive prostate cancers. In this study, we showed that 6 of these fusion genes are present in 7 different types of human malignancies with variable frequencies. Among them, the CCNH-C5orf30 and TRMT11-GRIK2 gene fusions were found in breast cancer, colon cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, ovarian cancer and liver cancer, with frequencies ranging from 12.9% to 85%. In contrast, four other gene fusions (mTOR-TP53BP1, TMEM135-CCDC67, KDM4-AC011523.2 and LRRC59-FLJ60017) are less frequent. Both TRMT11-GRIK2 and CCNH-C5orf30 are also frequently present in lymph node metastatic cancer samples from the breast, colon and ovary. Thus, detecting these fusion transcripts may have significant biological and clinical implications in cancer patient management. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Quantifying the genetic correlation between cancers can provide important insights into the mechanisms driving cancer etiology. Using genome-wide association study summary statistics across six cancer types based on a total of 296,215 cases and 301,319 controls of European ancestry, here we estimate the pair-wise genetic correlations between breast, colorectal, head/neck, lung, ovary and prostate cancer, and between cancers and 38 other diseases. We observed statistically significant genetic correlations between lung and head/neck cancer (r g = 0.57, p = 4.6 × 10 −8 ), breast and ovarian cancer (r g = 0.24, p = 7 × 10 −5 ), breast and lung cancer (r g = 0.18, p =1.5 × 10 −6 ) and breast and colorectal cancer (r g = 0.15, p = 1.1 × 10 −4 ). We also found that multiple cancers are genetically correlated with non-cancer traits including smoking, psychiatric diseases and metabolic characteristics.

        fabio:abstract    "Purpose: Several previous studies have shown that oral bisphosphonates (BPs) are associated with the incidence of 13 specific cancers, including lung cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the findings are heterogeneous. Methods and results: Relevant studies published in databases such as PubMed, Embase database, and Cochrane library were systematically retrieved from inception to August 25th, 2018, regardless of language, by two investigators independently. Afterwards, the maximum adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted from the retrieved studies. Finally, 13 cohort studies involving 1,510,763 participants were enrolled into this meta-analysis. No significant relationship was found between oral BPs and the risk of all-cause cancer in osteoporosis (OP) patients among the entire population (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80–1.18; I 2 92.5%). Besides, oral BPs could remarkably reduce the incidence of breast cancer (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68–0.92; I 2 54%) and endometrial cancer (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64–0.96; I 2 0%) in postmenopausal OP females. In addition, oral BPs were also found to evidently reduce the incidence of upper gastrointestinal cancer in OP patients among the entire population (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54–0.98; I 2 36.1%). However, oral BPs may lead to increased risk of liver cancer in mixed genders (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.03–2.77; I 2 30.7%). Conclusions: Taken together, oral BPs do not increase the risk of incidence of all-cause cancer; instead, they can reduce the incidence of breast, endometrial, and upper gastrointestinal cancers among the postmenopausal OP females. Our analysis stratified by gender suggests that oral BPs may increase the incidence of liver cancer in mixed genders, while no significant association was observed in females. Careful analysis of post-marketing data should be conducted to address the clinical relevance of our results on the putative association of oral BP use and liver cancer suggested by our meta-analysis. © 2018, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation." ;

However, it remains unclear how cancer cells migrate in the three-dimensional (3D) matrix of cancer tissues and how CAFs support the cancer invasion. Here we propose a novel mechanism of fibroblast-dependent cancer cell invasion in the 3D collagen matrix. Human cancer cell lines from the pancreas (Panc-1), lung (A549) and some other organs actively adhered to normal fibroblasts and primary lung CAFs in cultures. To show its significance in tumor invasion, we designed a new invasion assay in which homogeneous microspheroids consisting of cancer cells and fibroblasts were embedded into collagen gel. Time-lapse experiments showed that cancer cells adhered to and quickly migrated on the long protrusions of fibroblasts in the 3D collagen matrix. Fibroblast-free cancer cells poorly invaded the matrix. Experiments with function-blocking antibodies, siRNAs, and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that cancer cells adhered to fibroblasts through integrin α5β1-mediated binding to fibronectin on the surface of fibroblasts. Immunochemical analyses of the co-cultures and lung cancers suggested that cancer cells could acquire the migratory force by the fibronectin/integrin signaling. Our results also revealed that the fibroblast-bound fibronectin was a preferential substrate for cancer cells to migrate in the collagen matrix. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

However, very few studies investigated the role of integrin α3 (ITGα3) in malignant cancers. Here, we determined the functional role of ITGα3 in pancreatic cancer. Analysis of public microarray databases and Western blot analysis indicated a unique expression of ITGα3 in human pancreatic cancer. Silencing ITGα3 expression significantly inhibited the viability and migration of human pancreatic cancer cells. Notably, ablation of ITGα3 expression resulted in a significant decrease of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression compared with transfection of control-siRNA through an increased number of leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domain protein 1 (LRIG1) expression. In addition, ablating ITGα3 inhibited tumour growth via blockade of EGFR signalling in vivo. Furthermore, the highly expressed ITGα3 led to a poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. Our results provide novel insights into ITGα3-induced aggressive pancreatic cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Since epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in promoting metastasis of cancer, many mechanisms regarding EMT have been studied. We previously showed that Ribonucleic acid export 1 (RAE1) is dysregulated in breast cancer and its overexpression leads to aggressive breast cancer phenotypes by inducing EMT. Here, we evaluated the functional capacity of RAE1 in breast cancer metastasis by using a three-dimensional (3D) culture system and xenograft models. Furthermore, to investigate the mechanisms of RAE1-driven EMT, in vitro studies were carried out. The induction of EMT with RAE1-overexpression was confirmed under the 3D culture system and in vivo system. Importantly, RAE1 mediates upregulation of an EMT marker ZEB1, by binding to the promoter region of ZEB1. Knockdown of ZEB1 in RAE1-overexpressing cells suppressed invasive and migratory behaviors, accompanied by an increase in epithelial and a decrease in mesenchymal markers. Taken together, these data demonstrate that RAE1 contributes to breast cancer metastasis by regulating a key EMT-inducing factor ZEB1 expression, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Obesity is a risk factor for many cancers including breast, esophageal, colon, and thyroid cancer. We aimed to evaluate the association of thyroid cancer with body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and weight change. This nationwide population-based cohort study included 11,323,006 adults who joined the national health screening program. Weight change was defined as the difference between the weight of the subjects measured during the study period and the weight at the time of four years ago. For evaluating the association between the weight change and the risk of thyroid cancer, subjects without weight change for four years were defined as the reference group. Mean age was 50.1 ± 13.7 years and 44% were female. In total, 50,464 subjects (0.4%) had newly-diagnosed thyroid cancer. After multivariable analyses, the incidence of thyroid cancer increased significantly in subjects with larger WC as well as higher BMI (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). In subjects who were lean and became obese, the incidence of thyroid cancers increased significantly (hazard ratio [HR] 1.15 [1.11–1.19]). In subjects who were obese and became lean, the incidence of thyroid cancers decreased significantly (HR 0.89 [0.86–0.93]). These results demonstrated that higher BMI and larger WC were significantly associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer. Weight gain in lean subjects was associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer, and weight reduction in subjects with obesity was associated with a decreased risk of thyroid cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

In order to understand this increase, country specific dietary exposures have been investigated. The aim of this study was to quantify the association between consumption of brown cheese, a common bread topping in Norway, and colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer in the prospective Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) Study. Data on brown cheese consumption and adjustment factors was available for 82 527 women. During a mean of 14.6 years of follow-up (1.2 million person-years), there were 1360 cases of colorectal cancer (907 colon; 453 rectal). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer sites. We modelled restricted cubic splines with 4 knots, to assess a possible non-linear relationship between brown cheese intake and the investigated cancer sites. In the age-adjusted model, consumption of more than 2 slices (>16 grams) of brown cheese per day was associated with 13% reduced risk of colon cancer (95% CI 4%-21%) compared to women who did not consume brown cheese. The multivariable-adjusted model, however, showed no association between brown cheese consumption and the risk of colorectal, colon, or rectal cancer (colorectal: HR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.76–1.13, p-trend 0.37; colon: HR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.65–1.06; p-trend = 0.10; rectal: HR = 1.16, 95% CI 0.84–1.1.61, p-trend = 0.41). In this large, prospective cohort study of women, consumption of brown cheese was suggestively protective against colon cancer. However, adjustment attenuated the inverse risk association. Brown cheese consumption was not associated with rectal cancer, or colorectal cancer overall. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Current cancer diagnosis utilizes histopathology, which requires tissue acquisition, extensive processing and, in most cases, relies on the qualitative morphological analysis of tissues and cells. Molecular biomarkers are only available for a few specific tumor subtypes. We discovered that the fluorescence polarization (Fpol) of Methylene Blue (MB) is significantly higher in cancer than in normal human breast tissues and cells. We confirmed that fluorescence polarization imaging did not affect the viability of the cells and yielded highly significant differences between cancer and normal cells using MB concentrations as low as 0.05 and 0.01 mg/ml. To explain this phenomenon we examined intracellular localization of MB and its fluorescence lifetime. We determined that higher fluorescence polarization of MB occurs due to its increased accumulation in mitochondria of cancer cells, as well as shorter fluorescence lifetime in cancer relative to normal cells. As quantitative MB Fpol imaging can be performed in vivo and in real time, it holds the potential to provide an accurate quantitative marker of cancer at the cellular level. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

The anticancer polymers are designed to target anionic lipids exposed on the cancer cell surfaces and act by disrupting the cancer cell membranes. Because the polymer mechanism is not dependent on cell proliferation, we hypothesized that the polymers were active against dormant cancer cells. The polymers exhibited cytotoxicity to proliferating prostate cancer. Importantly, the polymer killed dormant prostate cancer cells that were resistant to docetaxel. This study demonstrates a new approach to discover novel anticancer therapeutics. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

We developed a novel computational platform applying a multi-modal approach to filter out passengers and more robustly identify putative driver genes. The primary filter identifies enrichment of cancer mutations in CATH functional families (CATH-FunFams) – structurally and functionally coherent sets of evolutionary related domains. Using structural representatives from CATH-FunFams, we subsequently seek enrichment of mutations in 3D and show that these mutation clusters have a very significant tendency to lie close to known functional sites or conserved sites predicted using CATH-FunFams. Our third filter identifies enrichment of putative driver genes in functionally coherent protein network modules confirmed by literature analysis to be cancer associated. Our approach is complementary to other domain enrichment approaches exploiting Pfam families, but benefits from more functionally coherent groupings of domains. Using a set of mutations from 22 cancers we detect 151 putative cancer drivers, of which 79 are not listed in cancer resources and include recently validated cancer associated genes EPHA7, DCC netrin-1 receptor and zinc-finger protein ZNF479. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Cox proportional hazards models were used. Males and females classified as obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg /m −2 ) have a 33% and 22% increased risk of all-cancer, respectively, than their normal weight counterparts. Similar all-cancer risk increases are observed for those above sex-specific WC guidelines.

Collectively, 86.3% (63/73) of HAMPs have recurrent alterations in at least 1 cancer type and 16 HAMPs, including 9 understudied HAMPs, are identified as putative therapeutic targets across multiple cancer types. For example, the recurrent focal amplification of BRD9 is observed in 9 cancer types and genetic depletion of BRD9 inhibits tumor growth.

        fabio:abstract    "The current system for evaluating prostate cancer architecture is the Gleason grading system which divides the morphology of cancer into five distinct architectural patterns, labeled 1 to 5 in increasing levels of cancer aggressiveness, and generates a score by summing the labels of the two most dominant patterns. The Gleason score is currently the most powerful prognostic predictor of patient outcomes; however, it suffers from problems in reproducibility and consistency due to the high intra-observer and inter-observer variability amongst pathologists. In addition, the Gleason system lacks the granularity to address potentially prognostic architectural features beyond Gleason patterns. We evaluate prostate cancer for architectural subtypes using techniques from topological data analysis applied to prostate cancer glandular architecture. In this work we demonstrate the use of persistent homology to capture architectural features independently of Gleason patterns. Specifically, using persistent homology, we compute topological representations of purely graded prostate cancer histopathology images of Gleason patterns 3,4 and 5, and show that persistent homology is capable of clustering prostate cancer histology into architectural groups through a ranked persistence vector. Our results indicate the ability of persistent homology to cluster prostate cancer histopathology images into unique groups with dominant architectural patterns consistent with the continuum of Gleason patterns. In addition, of particular interest, is the sensitivity of persistent homology to identify specific sub-architectural groups within single Gleason patterns, suggesting that persistent homology could represent a robust quantification method for prostate cancer architecture with higher granularity than the existing semi-quantitative measures. The capability of these topological representations to segregate prostate cancer by architecture makes them an ideal candidate for use as inputs to future machine learning approaches with the intent of augmenting traditional approaches with topological features for improved diagnosis and prognosis. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Accumulative studies demonstrate that UHRF1 is broadly overexpressed in cancers, which contributes to cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Interestingly, a proteasome-dependent downregulation of UHRF1 has been observed in pluripotent ground state mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) cultured in the presence of two kinase (MEK1/MEK2 and GSK3β) inhibitors (termed 2i), raising the question whether UHRF1 is similarly regulated in cancer cells. Here we present evidence that while addition of 2i broadly downregulates UHRF1 and DNMT1 in various cancer cells, distinct underlying mechanisms are involved. In contrast to mESCs, 2i-induced downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in cancer cells cannot be rescued by proteasome inhibitor and occurs primarily at the level of transcription. Furthermore, downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 by 2i is due to inhibition of MEK1/MEK2, but not GSK3β activity. Data mining reveals a marked co-expression of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in normal tissues as well as cancers. We provide evidence that multiple transcription factors including E2F1 and SP1 mediate the transcriptional activation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 by the activated MEK/ERK pathway. Together our study reveals distinct regulation of UHRF1/DNMT1 in mESCs and cancer cells and identifies activated MEK/ERK pathway as a driving force for coordinated and aberrant over-expression of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in cancers. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

When it is applied to cancer cells, solid stress hinders their proliferation rate and promotes cancer cell invasion and metastatic potential.

Here, we used two pancreatic cancer cell lines and an established in vitro system to study the effect of solid stress-induced signal transduction on pancreatic cancer cell migration as well as the mechanism involved. Our results show that the migratory ability of cells increases as a direct response to solid stress. We also found that Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) expression and secretion is strongly upregulated in pancreatic cancer cells in response to mechanical compression. Performing a phosphoprotein screening, we identified that solid stress activates the Akt/CREB1 pathway to transcriptionally regulate GDF15 expression, which eventually promotes pancreatic cancer cell migration. Our results suggest a novel solid stress signal transduction mechanism bringing GDF15 to the centre of pancreatic tumor biology and rendering it a potential target for future anti-metastatic therapeutic innovations. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

We have reported that mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mitROS) upregulate uptake transporter of porphyrins, heme carrier protein-1 (HCP-1). The accumulation of cancer-specific porphyrins was increased by mitROS production, thereby the cancer-specific PDT cytotoxicity was enhanced. Thus we investigated whether mitROS production by hyperthermia can enhanced the cytotoxicity of PDT or not. In this study, 1 h of hyperthermia at 42 °C increased the mitROS production, and both the accumulation of cancer-specific porphyrins and the PDT cytotoxicity increased. Moreover, the authors treated cells with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) to examine the effect of mitROS. NAC inhibited the increasing ROS production after hyperthermia to restrain the post-treatment increase of cancer-specific porphyrins accumulation. Moreover, the increase of ROS production in cancer cells after hyperthermia upregulated HCP-1 expression and downregulated ABCG2 expression. These regulation were inhibited by NAC. These results suggest that hyperthermia treatment increased mitROS production, which involved HpD accumulation and enhanced PDT effects in cancer cells. The mechanism of this phenomenon was most likely to be due to both the upregulation of HCP-1 and the downregulation of ABCG2 by mitROS. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Recent studies showed that changes to the gut microbiome alters the microbiome-derived metabolome, potentially promoting carcinogenesis in organs that are distal to the gut. In this study, we assessed the relationship between breast cancer and cadaverine biosynthesis. Cadaverine treatment of Balb/c female mice (500 nmol/kg p.o. q.d.) grafted with 4T1 breast cancer cells ameliorated the disease (lower mass and infiltration of the primary tumor, fewer metastases, and lower grade tumors). Cadaverine treatment of breast cancer cell lines corresponding to its serum reference range (100–800 nM) reverted endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, inhibited cellular movement and invasion, moreover, rendered cells less stem cell-like through reducing mitochondrial oxidation. Trace amino acid receptors (TAARs), namely, TAAR1, TAAR8 and TAAR9 were instrumental in provoking the cadaverine-evoked effects. Early stage breast cancer patients, versus control women, had reduced abundance of the CadA and LdcC genes in fecal DNA, both responsible for bacterial cadaverine production. Moreover, we found low protein expression of E. coli LdcC in the feces of stage 1 breast cancer patients. In addition, higher expression of lysine decarboxylase resulted in a prolonged survival among early-stage breast cancer patients. Taken together, cadaverine production seems to be a regulator of early breast cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

The specific function of CBX6 in breast cancer is currently undefined. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset led to the identification of CBX6 as a consistently downregulated gene in breast cancer. We provided evidence showing enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) negatively regulated CBX6 expression in a Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)-dependent manner. Exogenous overexpression of CBX6 inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation, and induced cell cycle arrest along with suppression of migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro. Microarray analyses revealed that CBX6 governs a complex gene expression program. Moreover, CBX6 induced significant downregulation of bone marrow stromal cell antigen-2 (BST2), a potential therapeutic target, via interactions with its promoter region. Our collective findings support a tumor suppressor role of CBX6 in breast cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "MRI plays important roles in endometrial and cervical cancer assessment, from detection to recurrent disease evaluation. Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common malignant tumor of the female genital tract in Western countries. EC patients are divided into risk categories based on histopathological tumor type, grade, and myometrial invasion depth. EC is surgically staged using the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) system. Since FIGO (2009) stage correlates with prognosis, preoperative staging is essential for tailored treatment. MRI reveals myometrial invasion depth, which correlates with tumor grade and lymph node metastases, and thus correlates with prognosis. Cervical cancer (CC) is the second most common cancer, and the third leading cause of cancer-related death among females in developing countries. The FIGO Gynecologic Oncology Committee recently revised its CC staging guidelines, allowing staging based on imaging and pathological findings when available. The revised FIGO (2018) staging includes node involvement and thus enables both therapy selection and evaluation, prognosis estimation, and calculation of end results. MRI can accurately assess prognostic indicators, e.g., tumor size, parametrial invasion, pelvic sidewall, and lymph node invasion. Despite these important roles of MRI, radiologists still face challenges due to the technical and interpretation pitfalls of MRI during all phases of endometrial and cervical cancer evaluation. Awareness of mimics that can simulate both cancers is critical. With careful application, functional MRI with DWI and DCE sequences can help establish a correct diagnosis, although it is sometimes necessary to perform biopsy and histopathological analysis. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

This led to the first biological based liquid biopsy test, which we called MATER-D platform. In the present study, we showed for the first time that a different type of OMCs (PTEN-deficient human epithelial MCF10A cells) turn malignant when exposed to cancer patient’s sera, confirming the concept that different cells with diverse oncosuppressor mutations can uptake cancer factors and be used in biological based liquid biopsy tests. Our observations were confirmed in a large variety of solid and haematological malignancies. This test was able to detect dysplasia and carcinomas in situ lesions in different organs and circulating factors in cancer patients years after the removal of their lesions. To our knowledge, this ability is unique and not shared by other liquid biopsy platforms. Immunohistochemistry analysis of the xenotransplants revealed identical patterns of differentiation regardless of the cancer type, showing that differentiation through horizontal transfer might be dependent on the nature of the target cells rather than the type of cancer factors. These data strengthen the notion that OMC-based liquid biopsy tests might be promising platforms for cancer screening. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Various studies have shown the significance of identifying drug targets for cancer, although this process continues challenging in the field of anti-cancer drug designing. The primary purpose of this study is to design a novel approach to identify target genes for cancer. The sub-network of colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancers were constructed from human protein–protein interaction network. The potential genes were analyzed using hubs and centrality measures. For the identification of target genes, we retrieve those genes that had the highest score in both mutation rates and graph centrality. Moreover, gene deletion analysis revealed that MYC, TP53, and EGFR genes remained potential targets in colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancer respectively. Results suggest that combining network measures with mutation frequencies in cancer genes might assist in recognizing several potential drug targets. Future enhancement of this current approach is to combine these network properties with the biological insights from gene expression data, and their functions will provide a reliable method for rational drug designing. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature." ;

Owing to enhanced permeability and retention in solid tumor tissue, nanoparticle (NP) delivery systems have been emerged as novel strategy in cancer chemotherapy. As extracellular matrix, glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) could bind its surface receptor adhesion molecule CD44 which is strongly expressed on breast cancer. We have previously reported a doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded HA-Lys-LA X-NPs (X-NP-DOX) NP delivery system for breast cancer treatment. In this study, we further investigated the antitumor effect of X-NP-DOX NP delivery system using low-dose DOX in both in vitro and in vivo systems. We demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX possessed the ability for inhibiting MCF-7 breast cancer cell growth, invasion, and migration, and inducing apoptosis in vitro. In in vivo experiments, injection of low-dose X-NP-DOX into tumor-bearing mouse resulted in significant reduction of tumor size. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining further revealed that low-dose X-NP-DOX induced higher percentage of apoptotic cells compared with free DOX or saline. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX inhibited Notch1 and Ras/MAPK pathways, decreased cancer stem cell population, and reduced tumorigenesis compared to free DOX in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Owing to its enhanced efficacy and higher targetability compared to free DOX, low-dose DOX delivered by NP system may be a promising novel strategy for breast cancer treatment." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Breast cancer survivors display altered inflammatory responses to immune challenges relative to cancer-naive controls likely due to previous cancer treatments, stress associated with cancer, and/or tumor physiology. Proper inflammatory responses are necessary for adaptive sickness behaviors (e.g., fatigue, anorexia, and fever) and neuroinflammatory pathways are also implicated in mental health disturbances (e.g., cognitive impairment, depression) suffered by cancer patients and survivors. Rodent cancer models indicate that tumors are sufficient to exacerbate neuroinflammatory responses after an immune challenge, however primary tumors are not usually present in cancer survivors, and the behavioral consequences of these brain changes remain understudied. Therefore, we tested the extent to which mammary tumor resection attenuates tumor-induced neuroinflammation and sickness behavior following an immune challenge (i.p. lipopolysaccharide [LPS] injection) in mice. Tnf-α, Il-1β, and Il-6 mRNA decreased in multiple brain regions of LPS-treated tumor-bearing mice relative to LPS-treated controls; tumor resection attenuated these effects in some cases (but not Tnf-α). Tumors also attenuated sickness behaviors (hypothermia and lethargy) compared to LPS-treated controls. Tumor resection reversed these behavioral consequences, although basal body temperature remained elevated, comparable to tumor-bearing mice. Thus, tumors significantly modulate neuroinflammatory pathways with functional consequences and tumor resection mitigates most, but not all, of these changes. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Although substantial advances have been obtained both in treatment and survival rates, there is still a need for new therapeutical approaches. Natural compounds are a realistic source of new bioactive compounds with anticancer activity. Among them, rosemary polyphenols have shown a vast antiproliferative capacity against colon cancer cells in vitro and in animal models. We have investigated the antitumor activity of a rosemary extract (RE) obtained by using supercritical fluid extraction through its capacity to inhibit various signatures of cancer progression and metastasis such as proliferation, migration, invasion and clonogenic survival. RE strongly inhibited proliferation, migration and colony formation of colon cancer cells regardless their phenotype. Treatment with RE led to a sharp increase of intracellular ROS that resulted in necrosis cell death. Nrf2 gene silencing increased RE cytotoxic effects, thus suggesting that this pathway was involved in cell survival. These in vitro results were in line with a reduction of tumor growth by oral administration of RE in a xenograft model of colon cancer cells using athymic nude mice. These findings indicate that targeting colon cancer cells by increasing intracellular ROS and decreasing cell survival mechanisms may suppose a therapeutic option in colon cancer through the combination of rosemary compounds and chemotherapeutic drugs. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Although cure rates are high for early stage disease, clinical outcomes for advanced, metastatic, or recurrent disease remain poor. To change this panorama, a deeper understanding of cervical cancer biology and novel study models are needed. Immortalized human cancer cell lines such as HeLa constitute crucial scientific tools, but there are few other cervical cancer cell lines available, limiting our understanding of a disease known for its molecular heterogeneity. This study aimed to establish novel cervical cancer cell lines derived from Brazilian patients. We successfully established one (HCB-514) out of 35 cervical tumors biopsied. We confirmed the phenotype of HCB-514 by verifying its’ epithelial and tumor origin through cytokeratins, EpCAM and p16 staining. It was also HPV-16 positive. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) showed relevant somatic mutations in several genes including BRCA2, TGFBR1 and IRX2. A copy number variation (CNV) analysis by nanostring and WES revealed amplification of genes mainly related to kinases proteins involved in proliferation, migration and cell differentiation, such as EGFR, PIK3CA, and MAPK7. Overexpression of EGFR was confirmed by phospho RTK-array and validated by western blot analysis. Furthermore, the HCB-514 cell line was sensitive to cisplatin. In summary, this novel Brazilian cervical cancer cell line exhibits relevant key molecular features and constitutes a new biological model for pre-clinical studies. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Oncogene-induced replication stress (RS) promotes cancer development but also impedes tumor growth by activating anti-cancer barriers. To determine how cancer cells adapt to RS, we have monitored the expression of different components of the ATR-CHK1 pathway in primary tumor samples. We show that unlike upstream components of the pathway, the checkpoint mediators Claspin and Timeless are overexpressed in a coordinated manner. Remarkably, reducing the levels of Claspin and Timeless in HCT116 cells to pretumoral levels impeded fork progression without affecting checkpoint signaling. These data indicate that high level of Claspin and Timeless increase RS tolerance by protecting replication forks in cancer cells. Moreover, we report that primary fibroblasts adapt to oncogene-induced RS by spontaneously overexpressing Claspin and Timeless, independently of ATR signaling. Altogether, these data indicate that enhanced levels of Claspin and Timeless represent a gain of function that protects cancer cells from of oncogene-induced RS in a checkpoint-independent manner. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Turmeric, since in ancient Indian traditional medicinal system, has been implicated for its therapeutic and chemopreventive properties against a broad spectrum of diseases. Curcumin, the active polyphenol from turmeric, helps to obstruct the growth of many types of cancers at various stages which include prostrate, melanoma, breast, brain tumor, pancreatic, leukemia, etc. The initiation and recurrence of cancer have been attributed to few mutated cells in bulk of tumor called as cancer stem cells which have the capacity of self-renewal and differentiation. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3B) is a multifunctional serine/threonine protein kinase, originally found in mammals, an important component of diverse signaling pathways, dysregulation of which leads to affect the cancer stem cell properties. The nutritional- and phytochemical-based dietary interventions may complement current chemotherapy to prevent recurrence and relapse of cancer. The objective of present study is to investigate the effect of retinoic acid and curcumin–retinoic acid conjugates against GSK-3B protein. The in silico results indicate that molecule 3 (curcumin–retinoic acid conjugates) might be a potent inhibitor of GSK-3B and a novel future drug candidate for the treatment of cancer. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature." ;

        fabio:abstract    "In this study, we aimed to identify mutations of key genes associated with docetaxel resistance in nine endometrial cancer cell lines. Endometrial cancers are associated with several critical gene mutations, including PIK3A, PTEN, and KRAS. Different gene mutations in endometrial cancer cells have varied responses to anticancer drugs and cancer therapies. The most frequently altered gene in endometrioid endometrial carcinoma tumors is PTEN. PTEN protein has lipid phosphatase and protein phosphatase activity, as well as other functions in the nucleus. Although the tumor-suppressive function of PTEN has mainly been attributed to its lipid phosphatase activity, a role for PTEN protein phosphatase activity in cell cycle regulation has also been suggested. Various tumor type-specific PTEN mutations are well documented. Here, nine endometrioid endometrial cancer cell lines with PIK3A, PTEN, and KRAS gene mutations were treated with docetaxel and radiation. One mutation with a docetaxel drug-resistant effect was a truncated form of PTEN. Among PTEN mutations in endometrial cancer cells, the Y68 frame shift mutation of PTEN constitutes a major mechanism of resistance to docetaxel treatment. The molecular mechanism involves truncation of the 403 amino acid PTEN protein at amino acid 68 by the Y68 frame shift, leading to the loss of PTEN protein phosphatase and lipid phosphatase activities. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Hence to mimic such complex biological processes, an understanding of stimuli responsiveness is needed to sense specific changes and respond in a predictable manner. Such responses due to polymers may take place either simultaneously at the site or in a sequential manner from preparation to transporting pathways to cellular compartments. The present review comprehends the stimuli-responsive polymers and multi-responsiveness with respect to cancer therapy. It focuses on the exploitation of different stimuli like temperature, pH and enzymes responsiveness in a multi-stimuli setting. Nanogels and micelles being two of the most commonly used responsive polymeric carriers have also been discussed. The role of multiple stimuli delivery system is significant due to multiple changes happening in the near surroundings of cancer cells. These responsive materials are able to mimic some biological processes and recognize at the molecular level itself to manipulate development of custom-designed molecules for targeting cancer cells." ;

In contrast, antibodies to BLV were found in a very small percentage of healthy blood donors. There was no association between BLV DNA and other tumor prognostic biological markers such as hormonal receptors, HER2 oncoprotein, proliferation index, metastasis in sentinels lymph nodes, and tumor grade and size. Our findings suggest that BLV should be considered a potential predisposing factor to breast cancer in women. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Here we report that ovarian cancer cells manifest a spectrum of tumorigenic phenotypes upon knockdown of PIK3R1. PIK3R1 loss activates AKT and p110-independent JAK2/STAT3 signaling through inducing changes in the phosphorylation of the docking protein Gab2, thereby relieving the negative inhibition on AKT and promoting the assembly of JAK2/STAT3 signalosome, respectively. Additional mechanisms leading to AKT activation include enhanced p110α kinase activity and a decrease in PTEN level. PIK3R1 loss renders ovarian cancer cells vulnerable to inhibition of AKT or JAK2/STAT3. The combination of AKT and STAT3 inhibitors significantly increases the anti-tumor effect compared to single-agent treatments.

Finally, analysis of 214 prostate and 35 breast cancer genomes reveal that late-replicating regions are prone to cis and early-replication to trans chromosomal rearrangements.

        fabio:abstract    "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are promising therapies for haematological cancers. Historically, their therapeutic benefit is due to ADC targeting of lineage-restricted antigens. The C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is attractive for targeted therapy of haematological cancers, given its expression in multiple tumour types and role in cancer “homing” to bone marrow. However, CXCR4 is also expressed in haematopoietic cells and other normal tissues, raising safety challenges to the development of anti-CXCR4 ADCs for cancer treatment. Here, we designed the first anti-CXCR4 ADC with favourable therapeutic index, effective in xenografts of haematopoietic cancers resistant to standard of care and anti-CXCR4 antibodies. We screened multiple ADC configurations, by varying type of linker-payload, drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR), affinity and Fc format. The optimal ADC bears a non-cleavable linker, auristatin as payload at DAR = 4 and a low affinity antibody with effector–reduced Fc. Contrary to other drugs targeting CXCR4, anti-CXCR4 ADCs effectively eliminated cancer cells as monotherapy, while minimizing leucocytosis. The optimal ADC selectively eliminated CXCR4 + cancer cells in solid tumours, but showed limited toxicity to normal CXCR4 + tissues, sparing haematopoietic stem cells and progenitors. Our work provides proof-of-concept that through empirical ADC design, it is possible to target proteins with broad normal tissue expression. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Cancers in the bone produce a number of severe symptoms including pain that compromises patient functional status, quality of life, and survival. The source of this pain is multifaceted and includes factors secreted from tumor cells. Malignant cells release the neurotransmitter and cell-signaling molecule glutamate via the oxidative stress-related cystine/glutamate antiporter, system x C − , which reciprocally imports cystine for synthesis of glutathione and the cystine/cysteine redox cycle. Pharmacological inhibition of system x C − has shown success in reducing and delaying the onset of cancer pain-related behavior in mouse models. This investigation describes the development of a stable siRNA-induced knockdown of the functional trans-membrane system x C − subunit xCT (SLC7A11) in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Clones were verified for xCT knockdown at the transcript, protein, and functional levels. RNAseq was performed on a representative clone to comprehensively examine the transcriptional cellular signature in response to xCT knockdown, identifying multiple differentially regulated factors relevant to cancer pain including nerve growth factor, interleukin-1, and colony-stimulating factor-1. Mice were inoculated intrafemorally and recordings of pain-related behaviors including weight bearing, mechanical withdrawal, and limb use were performed. Animals implanted with xCT knockdown cancer cells displayed a delay until the onset of nociceptive behaviors relative to control cells. These results add to the body of evidence suggesting that a reduction in glutamate release from cancers in bone by inhibition of the system x C − transporter may decrease the severe and intractable pain associated with bone metastases. © The Author(s) 2018." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Background: The global cancer incidence and the number of survivors are increasing. Therefore, it is necessary to pay more attention to the side effects of treatment. Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of reflexology on the side effects of chemotherapy in cancer patients. Method: For finding the related articles, the researchers searched several databases including PubMed &ProQuest and valid websites including ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Scientific Information Database, and Magiran. The key terms of \"reflexology, cancer, and chemotherapy\" individually and combined together were searched in Parisian and English, and the studies performed from 2009 to 2018 were extracted. Due to the lack of sufficient studies carried out into the outcome of reflexology on chemotherapy, both Persian and English articles were used. Results: A total of 57 studies were extracted from the databases and valid websites; five of which met the inclusion criteria. All selected studies were clinical trials. Implications for Practice: Reflexology can be used as a non-pharmacologic nursing intervention to alleviate the side effects of chemotherapy and improve the quality of life of cancer patients. © 2018 Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

        fabio:abstract    "CD47 is a prominent new target in cancer immunotherapy, with antagonistic antibodies currently being evaluated in clinical trials. For effective evaluation of this strategy it is crucial to identify which patients are suited for CD47-targeted therapy. In this respect, expression of the pro-phagocytic signal SLAMF7 on both macrophages and cancer cells was recently reported to be a requisite for CD47 antibody-mediated phagocytosis. Here, we demonstrate that in fact SLAMF7 expression on cancer cells is not required and does not impact on CD47 antibody therapy. Moreover, SLAMF7 also does not impact on phagocytosis induction by CD20 antibody rituximab nor associates with overall survival of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma patients. In contrast, expression of CD47 negatively impacts on overall and progression free survival. In conclusion, cancer cell expression of SLAMF7 is not required for phagocytosis and, in contrast to CD47 expression, should not be used as selection criterion for CD47-targeted therapy. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Increased Crabp2 levels have been found in various types of cancer, and are associated with poor patients’ survival. Although Crabp2 is found to be overexpressed in lung cancer, its role in metastasis of lung cancer is unclear. In this study, Crabp2 was overexpressed in high-metastatic C10F4 than low-metastatic lung cancer cells. Analysis of clinical samples revealed that high CRABP2 levels were correlated with lymph node metastases, poor overall survival, and increased recurrence. Knockdown of Crabp2 decreased migration, invasion, anoikis resistance, and in vivo metastasis. Crabp2 was co-immunoprecipitated with HuR, and overexpression of Crabp2 increased HuR levels, which promoted integrin β1/FAK/ERK signaling. Inhibition of HuR or integrin β1/FAK/ERK signaling reversed the promoting effect of Crabp2 in migration, invasion, and anoikis resistance. Knockdown of Crabp2 further inhibited the growth of cancer cells as compared with that by gemcitabine or irinotecan alone. The expression of Crabp2 in human lung tumors was correlated with stress marker CHOP. In conclusion, our findings have identified the promoting role of Crabp2 in anoikis resistance and metastasis. CRABP2 may serve as a prognostic marker and targeting CRABP2 may be exploited as a modality to reduce metastasis. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "SPG-56 is a newly isolated glycoprotein from sweet potatoes (Zhongshu NO. 1), but its value for suppressing breast cancer progression remains unknown. This study was designed to investigate the potential anti-cancer effects of SPG-56, which consists of 2.9% sugar and 97.1% protein. The effects of SPG-56 on the proliferation and apoptosis of breast cancer cells were determined using CCK-8 and Hoechst 33342 assays and flow cytometry, after staining with Annexin V and PI respectively. The activities of SPG-56 against breast cancer were examined using female BALB/c nude mice orthotopically implanted with human breast carcinoma cells of the types MCF-7 and 4T1-Luc. The cellular experiments showed that SPG-56 inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of MCF-7 cells dose- and time-dependently. Oral administration of SPG-56 significantly suppressed the development of MCF-7 tumor cells (P < 0.01) as compared with an untreated group. The serum tumor markers CEA, CA125 and CA153 in a 240 mg/kg/d SPG-56 decreased by 54.8%, 91.8%, and 90.3%, respectively. The experiments further demonstrated that SPG-56 inhibited the metastasis of breast cancer in MCF-7 and 4T1-bearing mice by altering the expression of MMP2, MMP9, VEGF, Occludin and Claudin. It is concluded that SPG-56 may have potential as a novel anti-tumor candidate for breast cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Lymph node metastasis is of major prognostic significance for breast cancer. Lymph node metastasis arises at a very early stage in some patients. Using the data downloaded from the TCGA database, we studied the differences between primary tumors with and without lymph node metastasis at the multi-omics level using bioinformatics approaches. Our study found that low mutation and neoantigen burdens correlated with lymph node metastazation of breast cancer. All three conserved domains in TP53 were mutated in lymph node-negative breast cancers, whereas only one domain was mutated in lymph node-positive samples. Mutations in microtubule-related proteins appear to help immune cells recognize tumors and inhibit their lymph node metastasis. Destroying microtubule-related proteins is a potential therapeutic strategy to inhibit lymph node metastasis of breast cancer. As the neoantigens specifically present in lymph node-positive breast cancers, MAPK10, BC9L, TRIM65, CD93, KITLG, CNPPD1, CPED1, CCDC146, TMEM185A, INO80D, and PSMD11 are potential targets for vaccine design. In the tumor microenvironment, reduced numbers of effector immune cells, especially activated memory CD4+ T cells and activated mast cells, facilitate breast cancer metastasis to the lymph nodes. According to transcriptome data, lymph node metastasis was mostly driven by gene mutation rather than by gene expression. Although differential gene expression analysis was based on lymph node metastasis status, many genes were shown to be differentially expressed based on estrogen receptor status. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Fibroblasts turn into cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumour microenvironment. CAFs have recently attracted attention for their function as a regulator of immune cell recruitment and function in addition to their tumour-promoting roles. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of CAFs on monocyte recruitment and macrophage polarization in breast cancer. CAFs, which were α-SMA expressing fibroblasts in contrast to normal fibroblasts (NFs), effectively recruited monocytes. Recruitment of monocytes by CAFs might be mediated by monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) as well as stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) cytokines. CAFs differentiated the recruited monocytes into M2-like macrophages which are capable of exerting their immunosuppressive roles via the PD-1 axis. CAF-educated monocytes exhibited strong immune suppression unlike NF-educated monocytes and enhanced the motility/invasion of breast cancer cells in addition to increasing the expressions of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes and vimentin protein in cancer cells. CAF-educated M1 macrophages displayed increased expression of M2 markers and production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in contrast to decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12 compared with control M1 macrophages; suggesting that CAFs were also able to induce the trans-differentiation of M1 macrophages to M2 macrophages. We then investigated the relationship between the infiltration of CAFs and tumour associated macrophages (TAMs) using tissue samples obtained from breast cancer patients. High grade of CAFs significantly correlated with the number of TAMs in human breast cancer tissue samples. It was also associated with higher Ki-67 proliferation index, and higher tumour volume. This result is in line with our finding of increased breast cancer cell proliferation due to the effects of CAF-educated monocytes in vitro. Our results concluded that CAFs play pivotal roles in sculpturing the tumour microenvironment in breast cancer, and therapeutic strategies to reverse the CAF-mediated immunosuppressive microenvironment should be taken into consideration. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

We construct iCells of four cancers and the corresponding tissue controls and identify the most rewired genes in cancer.

We biologically validate that they have a role in cancer by knockdown experiments followed by cell viability assays.

Our method achieves an accuracy of 96% for RNA-seq and 95% for mixed DNA-seq and RNA-seq identification. Even for a panel of only 94 cancer-related genes, accuracy remains at 82% but decreases when using smaller panels.

The angular spectra of scattering coefficient maps of normal tissues exhibit a spatial feature distinct from those of abnormal tissues. An angular spectrum index to quantify the differences between the normal and abnormal tissues is derived, and its strength in revealing subsurface cancer in ex vivo samples is statistically analyzed.

        fabio:abstract    "Metastatic colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer death. Current options in palliation such as hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) present severe side effects. Recent research efforts suggested the therapeutic use of oxidant-enriched liquid using cold physical plasma. To investigate a clinically accepted treatment regimen, we assessed the antitumor capacity of plasma-treated saline solution. In response to such liquid, CT26 murine colon cancer cells were readily oxidized and showed cell growth with subsequent apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and upregulation of immunogenic cell death (ICD) markers in vitro. This was accompanied by marked morphological changes with re-arrangement of actin fibers and reduced motility. Induction of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype was not observed. Key results were confirmed in MC38 colon and PDA6606 pancreatic cancer cells. Compared to plasma-treated saline, hydrogen peroxide was inferiorly toxic in 3D tumor spheroids but of similar efficacy in 2D models. In vivo, plasma-treated saline decreased tumor burden in Balb/C mice. This was concomitant with elevated numbers of intratumoral macrophages and increased T cell activation following incubation with CT26 cells ex vivo. Being a potential adjuvant for HIPEC therapy, our results suggest oxidizing saline solutions to inactivate colon cancer cells while potentially stimulating antitumor immune responses. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Although solid fuel combustion emissions are known to increase the prevalence of illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer, however, their effect on the eyes is underexplored. This study assesses the acute toxicity of solid fuel combustion emissions on healthy ocular cells and a cancer cell line. Three healthy ocular cell lines (corneal, lens, and retinal epithelial cells) and a cancer cell line (Chinese hamster ovary cells) were exposed to liquid and gas phase emissions from applewood and coal combustion. Following the exposure, real-time cell attachment behavior was monitored for at least 120 hours with electrical cell impedance spectroscopy. The viability of the cells, amount of apoptotic cells, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were quantified with MTT, ApoTox-Glo, and ROS-Glo H 2 O 2 assays, respectively. The results showed that coal emissions compromised the viability of ocular cells more than applewood emissions. Interestingly, the cancer cells, although their viability was not compromised, generated 1.7 to 2.7 times more ROS than healthy cells. This acute exposure study provides compelling proof that biomass combustion emissions compromise the viability of ocular cells and increase ROS generation. The increased ROS generation was fatal for ocular cells, but it promoted the growth of cancer cells. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) include endogenous metabolites that provide information about health and disease which might be useful to develop a better screening method for breast cancer. The goal of this study was to classify mice with and without tumors and compare tumors localized to the mammary pad and tumor cells injected into the iliac artery by differences in VOCs in urine. After 4T1.2 tumor cells were injected into BALB/c mice either in the mammary pad or into the iliac artery, urine was collected, VOCs from urine headspace were concentrated by solid phase microextraction and results were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry quadrupole time-of-flight. Multivariate and univariate statistical analyses were employed to find potential biomarkers for breast cancer and metastatic breast cancer in mice models. A set of six VOCs classified mice with and without tumors with an area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC AUC) of 0.98 (95% confidence interval [0.85, 1.00]) via five-fold cross validation. Classification of mice with tumors in the mammary pad and iliac artery was executed utilizing a different set of six VOCs, with a ROC AUC of 0.96 (95% confidence interval [0.75, 1.00]). © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

In an additional two metastatic colon cancer patients, we detected CD8 + neoantigen-specific cells targeting the mutated SMAD5 and MUC4 proteins.

Moreover, the high drug loading capacity of Cet-SLN was employed to encapsulate photothermal agent indocyanine green (ICG) to finally fabricate a versatile drug delivery system (DDS) able to co-deliver Cet and ICG (Cet-SLN/ICG) for combinational chemo-photothermal therapy of breast cancer. The obtained results clearly demonstrated that Cet-SLN/ICG was well-dispersed nanoparticles with preferable stability under physiological condition. Furthermore, due to the conjugation of Cet, Cet-SLN/ICG could target EGFR which overexpress in MCF-7 cells. Most importantly, both in vitro and in vivo results suggested that compared with Cet or ICG alone, the Cet-SLN/ICG showed superior anticancer efficacy. In conclusion, Cet-SLN/ICG could be a potential platform for effective combinational chemo-photothermal therapy for breast cancer." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The integration of genomic and DNA methylation data has been demonstrated as a powerful strategy in understanding cancer mechanisms and identifying therapeutic targets. The TCGA consortium has mapped DNA methylation in thousands of cancer samples using Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 K BeadChip (Illumina 450 K array) that only covers about 1.5% of CpGs in the human genome. Therefore, increasing the coverage of the DNA methylome would significantly leverage the usage of the TCGA data. Here, we present a new model called EAGLING that can expand the Illumina 450 K array data 18 times to cover about 30% of the CpGs in the human genome. We applied it to analyze 13 cancers in TCGA. By integrating the expanded methylation, gene expression, and somatic mutation data, we identified the genes showing differential patterns in each of the 13 cancers. Many of the triple-evidenced genes identified in majority of the cancers are biomarkers or potential biomarkers. Pan-cancer analysis also revealed the pathways in which the triple-evidenced genes are enriched, which include well known ones as well as new ones, such as axonal guidance signaling pathway and pathways related to inflammatory processing or inflammation response. Triple-evidenced genes, particularly TNXB, RRM2, CELSR3, SLC16A3, FANCI, MMP9, MMP11, SIK1, and TRIM59 showed superior predictive power in both tumor diagnosis and prognosis. These results have demonstrated that the integrative analysis using the expanded methylation data is powerful in identifying critical genes/pathways that may serve as new therapeutic targets. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

However, macrophages make up a majority of immune cell infiltrates into tumors, creating natural targets for immunotherapies able to direct macrophages away from tumor-supportive functions and toward anti-tumor phenotypes. Recent studies demonstrate that toll-like receptors (TLRs) – pathways that quickly trigger early immune responses – play an important role in polarizing macrophages. Here, we present emerging ways in which TLR signaling is being manipulated in macrophages to create new opportunities for cancer immunotherapy. In particular, we discuss approaches to deliver TLR agonists, to leverage biomaterials in these therapies, and to couple TLR-based approaches with other frontline treatments as combination cancer therapies. © 2018" ;

We analyzed the immune profiles, T cell cytotoxicity, and TCR repertoire of peripheral blood, normal lung tissue, and tumor tissue from NSCLC patients. By using bispecific T-cell engager technology to assess the cytotoxicity of T cells, we found that the cytotoxicity of tumor-infiltrated T cells closely correlated with that of peripheral T cells. This correlation was supported by the immune profiles, cytokine production, and results of the TCR repertoire analysis from these specimens. We also found that the cytotoxicity of peripheral T cells has potential as a predictor of the effects of nivolumab in the tumor microenvironment.

This standard procedure relies on the slow radioactivity loss, usually attributed to the limited tumour expression of G6P-phosphatase (G6Pase). However, this classical interpretation intrinsically represents an approximation since, as in all tissues, cancer G6Pase activity is remarkable and is confined to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whose lumen must be reached by phosphorylated FDG to explain its hydrolysis and radioactivity release. The present study tested the impact of G6Pase sequestration on the mathematical description of FDG trafficking and handling in cultured cancer cells. Our data show that accounting for tracer access to the ER configures this compartment as the preferential site of FDG accumulation. This is confirmed by the reticular localization of fluorescent FDG analogues. Remarkably enough, reticular accumulation rate of FDG is dependent upon extracellular glucose availability, thus configuring the same ER as a significant determinant of cancer glucose metabolism. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Although current methods of treatment for cervical cancer can ablate lesions, preventing metastatic disseminations and excessive tissue injuries still remains a major concern. Hence, development of a safer and more efficient treatment modality is of vital importance. Natural products from plants are one of the principal sources of precursors to lead compounds with direct pharmaceutical application across all disease classes. One of these plants is Ficus carica, whose fruit latex, when applied on HPV-induced skin warts, has shown potential as a possible cure for this virus related lesions. This study explores the in vitro biological activities of fig latex and elucidates its possible mechanisms of action on cervical cancer cell lines CaSki and HeLa positive for HPV type 16 and 18, respectively. Our data shows that fig latex inhibits properties that are associated with HPV-positive cervical cancer transformed cells such as rapid growth and invasion and substantially downregulated the expression of p16 and HPV onco-proteins E6, E7. These findings suggest Ficus carica latex has the potential to be used in the development of therapeutic modalities for the possible treatment, cure and prevention of HPV related cervical cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing methods, the diversity and composition of the microbiota from ovarian cancer tissues (25 samples) and normal distal fallopian tube tissues (25 samples) were analyzed. High-throughput sequencing showed that the diversity and richness indexes were significantly decreased in ovarian cancer tissues compared to tissues from normal distal fallopian tubes. The ratio of the two phyla for Proteobacteria/Firmicutes was notably increased in ovarian cancer, which revealed that microbial composition change might be associated with the process of ovarian cancer development. In addition, transcriptome-sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses suggested that the transcriptional profiles were statistically different between ovarian carcinoma and normal distal fallopian tubes. Moreover, a set of genes including 84 different inflammation-associated or immune-associated genes, which had been named as the human antibacterial-response genes were also modulated expression.

        fabio:abstract    "Several pioneering work have established that apart from genetic alterations, epigenetic modifications contribute significantly in tumor progression. Remarkable role of EZH2 in cancer highlights the importance of identifying its targets. Although much emphasis has been placed in recent years in designing drugs and inhibitors targeting EZH2, less effort has been given in exploring its existing targets that will help in understanding the oncogenic role of EZH2 in turn which may provide a more stringent method of targeting EZH2. In the present study, we validated six direct targets of EZH2 that are GPNMB, PMEPA1, CoL5A1, VGLL4, POMT2 and SUMF1 associated with cancer related pathways. Upon EZH2 knockdown, more than two fold increase in the target gene expression was evident. CHIP-qPCR performed in both MCF-7 and MDA-MDA-231 confirmed the in-vivo binding of EZH2 on its identified target. Thirty invasive breast carcinoma cases with their adjacent normal tissues were included in the study. Immunohistochemistry in primary breast tumor tissue array showed tumor dependent expression of EZH2. Array of MERAV expression database revealed the strength of association of EZH2 with its target genes. Real time PCR performed with RNA extracted from breast tumor tissues further authenticated the existing negative correlation between EZH2 and its target genes. Pearson correlation coefficient & statistical significance computed using the matrix provided in the database strengthened the negative correlation between identified target genes and EZH2. KM plotter analysis showed improved relapse-free survival with increased expression of PMEPA1, POMT2, VGLL4 and SUMF1 in breast cancer patients indicating their therapeutic potential. While investigating the relevance of these target genes, different mutations of them were found in breast cancer patients. Seeking the clinical relevance of our study, following our recent publication that reports the role of EZH2 in nicotine-mediated breast cancer development and progression, we observed significant reduced expression of SUMF1 in breast cancer patient samples with smoking history in comparison to never-smoked patient samples. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we report that TOP1MT is overexpressed in cancer tissues and demonstrate that TOP1MT deficiency attenuates tumor growth in human and mouse models of colon and liver cancer. Due to their mitochondrial dysfunction, TOP1MT-KO cells become addicted to glycolysis, which limits synthetic building blocks and energy supply required for the proliferation of cancer cells in a nutrient-deprived tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, we show that TOP1MT associates with mitoribosomal subunits, ensuring optimal mitochondrial translation and assembly of oxidative phosphorylation complexes that are critical for sustaining tumor growth. The TOP1MT genomic signature profile, based on Top1mt-KO liver cancers, is correlated with enhanced survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Our results highlight the importance of TOP1MT for tumor development, providing a potential rationale to develop TOP1MT-targeted drugs as anticancer therapies. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

A new data integrative approach, based on graphical models, was applied on our multi-modal –omics, and clinical data cohort of metastatic melanoma patients. We found that response to chemotherapy is directly linked to ten gene expression, four methylation variables and PARP1 SNP rs1805407. PARP1 is a DNA repair gene critical for chemotherapy response and for which FDA-approved inhibitors are clinically available (olaparib). We demonstrated that two PARP inhibitors (ABT-888 and olaparib) make SNP carrier cancer cells of various histologic subtypes more sensitive to alkylating agents, but they have no effect in wild-type cells. Furthermore, PARP1 inhibitors act synergistically with chemotherapy in SNP carrier cells (especially in ovarian cancer for which olaparib is FDA-approved), but they are additive at best in wild-type cancer cells. Taken together, our results suggest that the combination of chemotherapy and PARP1 inhibition may benefit the carriers of rs1805407 in the future and may be used in personalized therapy strategies to select patients that are more likely to respond to PARP inhibitors. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Cancer remains one of the biggest threats to human society. There are massive demands for compounds to selectively kill cancerous cells. Earlier studies have shown that bovine α -lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells (BAMLET) becomes cytotoxic against cancer cells in complex with oleic acid {Hoque, M. et. al., PLoSOne8, e68390 (2013)}. In our study, we obtained bovine α-lactalbumin complexed with lanthanum ion (La 3+ -B-α-LA) and determined its high resolution crystal structure. The natural calcium binding site of bovine α-lactalbumin is replaced by lanthanum. The La 3+ complex formation by B-α-apo-LA was also supported by various biophysical methods. Interestingly, our complex, La 3+ -B-α-LA exhibits much greater anticancer activity against breast cancer cells as compared to the reported BAMLET-oleic acid complex. This study shows that La 3+ -B-α-LA complex is preferentially more toxic to MCF-7 cells as compared to KB (oral cancer) and HeLa (cervical) cells, while almost non-toxic to the healthy cells that we studied. Our data indicates that the cytotoxicity of La 3+ -B-α-LA against cancer cells is through apoptotic path way. The higher anticancer activity of La 3+ -B-α-LA is attributable to the requisite structural changes induced in the protein by La 3+ binding as supported by the crystal structure of the complex. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

However, no studies have evaluated vascular pain in patients with colorectal cancer in relation to peripheral venous administration of chemotherapy with or without oxaliplatin. We evaluated oxaliplatin-induced vascular pain using subjective and objective methods. We determined if oxaliplatin induced vascular pain in patients with colorectal cancer using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and a PainVision PS-2100 device. We compared VAS score between chemotherapy regimens with or without oxaliplatin, and between genders. We also examined the correlations of VAS score with pain intensity examined by the PainVision PS-2100, and with age and vessel diameter. A total of 98 patients with colorectal cancer were enrolled in this study, including 78 patients who received oxaliplatin via peripheral venous administration and 20 who received chemotherapy without oxaliplatin. The median VAS scores in patients with and without oxaliplatin were 36.5 (interquartile range 9.0–60.0) and 0 (0–4.0), respectively (P < 0.001), and the median pain intensities according to PainVision were 43.5 (14.3–98) and 36.5 (9.3–58.5), respectively (P < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between VAS and pain intensity (r = 0.584), but no correlation between VAS score and age (r = −0.174) or vessel diameter (r = −0.107).

One of the emerging techniques with tremendous power for lung cancer therapy is magnetic aerosol drug targeting (MADT). The use of a permanent magnet for effective drug delivery in a desired location throughout the lung requires extensive optimization, but it has not been addressed yet. In the present study, the possibility of using a permanent magnet for trapping the particles on a lung tumor is evaluated numerically in the Weibel's model from G0 to G3. The effect of different parameters is considered on the efficiency of particle deposition in a tumor located on a distant position of the lung bronchi and bronchioles. Also, the effective position of the magnetic source, tumor size, and location are the objectives for particle deposition. The results show that a limited particle deposition occurs on the lung branches in passive targeting. However, the incorporation of a permanent magnet next to the tumor enhanced the particle deposition fraction on G2 to up to 49% for the particles of 7 µm diameter. Optimizing the magnet size could also improve the particle deposition fraction by 68%. It was also shown that the utilization of MADT is essential for effective drug delivery to the tumors located on the lower wall of airway branches given the dominance of the air velocity and resultant drag force in this region. The results demonstrated the high competence and necessity of MADT as a noninvasive drug delivery method for lung cancer therapy." ;

Adjuvant chemotherapy has significantly reduced mortality but increased cognitive impairments, including attention function, making quality of life issues a crucial concern. This study enrolled nineteen breast cancer patients who were treated with standard chemotherapy within 6 months and 20 sex-matched healthy controls to investigate the brain effects of chemotherapy. All participants underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) with mean fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (mfALFF) analysis and were correlated with neuropsychological tests, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised (CAMS-R), and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), to explore the possible underlying mechanism of cognitive alternations. We found increased mfALFF over the frontoparietal lobe and decreased mfALFF over the occipital lobe in the cancer patients compared with the healthy controls; the altered brain regions may be associated with the dorsal attention network (DAN) and may be explained by a compensatory mechanism. Both MMSE and CAMS-R scores showed a positive correlation with mfALFF in the occipital lobe but a negative correlation in the frontoparietal lobe. By contrast, IES-R scores showed a positive correlation with mfALFF in the frontoparietal lobe but a negative correlation in the occipital lobe. These alterations are potentially related to the effects of both chemotherapy and psychological distress.

Mutations that occur in certain splicing factor genes themselves have been implicated in many cancers, particularly myelodysplastic syndromes. Small molecules that target splicing factors have been developed as therapies to preferentially induce apoptosis in these cancer cells.

There have been many attempts to identify markers and key pathways induced throughout EMT but the process is complex and depends on the cancer type and tumour microenvironment. Here we used the colon cancer cell line HT29, which stably overexpressed Snail, the key transcription factor in early EMT, as a model for colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with a pro-metastatic phenotype. We investigated miRNA expression regulation during that phenotypic switching. We found that overexpression of Snail in HT29 cells triggered significant changes in individual miRNA levels but did not change the global efficiency of miRNA processing. Snail abundance repressed the expression of miR-192 and miR-194 and increased miR-205, let-7i and SNORD13 levels. These identified changes correlated with the reported transcriptomic alterations in Snail-overexpressing HT29 cells. We also investigated how Snail affected the miRNA content of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from HT29 cells.

        fabio:abstract    "Solid malignancies are associated with the development of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP). This study aimed to evaluate the risk factors for PJP among patients with lung cancer. This retrospective case-control study compared patients who had lung cancer with PJP (n = 112) or without PJP (n = 336) matched according to age, sex, histopathology, and stage. PJP definition was based on (i) positive PCR or direct immunofluorescence results for pneumocystis, (ii) clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities that were consistent with a pneumonic process, and (iii) received targeted PJP treatment. The development of PJP was associated with radiotherapy (RTx), concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRTx), lymphopenia, and prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (20 mg of prednisolone equivalent per day for ≥3 weeks). Multivariate analysis revealed independent associations with prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06–3.63; p = 0.032) and CCRTx (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.27–3.43; p = 0.004). Steroid use was frequently related to RTx pneumonitis or esophagitis (29 patients, 43.3%). Prolonged high-dose steroid therapy and CCRTx were risk factors for PJP development among patients with lung cancer. As these patients had a poor prognosis, clinicians should consider PJP prophylaxis for high-risk patients with lung cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we compared The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) breast cancer genomic datasets (array and next generation sequencing (NGS) data) in detecting genomic alterations in clinically relevant genes. We performed an in silico analysis to determine the concordance in the frequencies of actionable mutations and copy number alterations/aberrations (CNAs) in the two most common breast cancer histologies, invasive lobular and invasive ductal carcinoma. We found that targeted sequencing identified a larger number of mutational hotspots and clinically significant amplifications that would have been missed by WES and SNP arrays in many actionable genes such as PIK3CA, EGFR, AKT3, FGFR1, ERBB2, ERBB3 and ESR1. The striking differences between the number of mutational hotspots and CNAs generated from these platforms highlight a number of factors that should be considered in the interpretation of array and NGS-based genomic data for precision medicine. Targeted panel sequencing was preferable to WES to define the full spectrum of somatic mutations present in a tumor. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Several oxaliplatin transporters were previously identified but their relative contributions to determining oxaliplatin tumour responses and gastrointestinal tumour cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin remains unclear. We studied clinical associations between tumour expression of oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes and patient response to oxaliplatin, then experimentally verified associations found with MRP2 in models of human gastrointestinal cancer. Among 18 oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes, MRP2 was the only one to be differentially expressed in the tumours of colorectal cancer patients who did or did not respond to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Over-expression of MRP2 (endogenously in HepG2 and PANC-1 cells, or induced by stable transfection of HEK293 cells) decreased oxaliplatin accumulation and cytotoxicity but those deficits were reversed by inhibition of MRP2 with myricetin or siRNA knockdown. Mice bearing subcutaneous HepG2 tumour xenografts were sensitised to oxaliplatin antitumour activity by concurrent myricetin treatment with little or no increase in toxicity. In conclusion, MRP2 limits oxaliplatin accumulation and response in human gastrointestinal cancer. Screening tumour MRP2 expression levels, to select patients for treatment with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy alone or in combination with a MRP2 inhibitor, could improve treatment outcomes. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

We compare optimized gene signatures for cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin responses in the same cell lines and validate each signature using data from patients with cancer. Supervised support vector machine learning is used to derive gene sets whose expression is related to the cell line GI50 values by backwards feature selection with cross-validation. Specific genes and functional pathways distinguishing sensitive from resistant cell lines are identified by contrasting signatures obtained at extreme and median GI50 thresholds. Ensembles of gene signatures at different thresholds are combined to reduce the dependence on specific GI50 values for predicting drug responses. The most accurate gene signatures for each platin are: cisplatin: BARD1, BCL2, BCL2L1, CDKN2C, FAAP24, FEN1, MAP3K1, MAPK13, MAPK3, NFKB1, NFKB2, SLC22A5, SLC31A2, TLR4, and TWIST1; carboplatin: AKT1, EIF3K, ERCC1, GNGT1, GSR, MTHFR, NEDD4L, NLRP1, NRAS, RAF1, SGK1, TIGD1, TP53, VEGFB, and VEGFC; and oxaliplatin: BRAF, FCGR2A, IGF1, MSH2, NAGK, NFE2L2, NQO1, PANK3, SLC47A1, SLCO1B1, and UGT1A1. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with bladder, ovarian, and colorectal cancer were used to test the cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin signatures, resulting in 71.0%, 60.2%, and 54.5% accuracies in predicting disease recurrence and 59%, 61%, and 72% accuracies in predicting remission, respectively. One cisplatin signature predicted 100% of recurrence in non-smoking patients with bladder cancer (57% disease-free; N = 19), and 79% recurrence in smokers (62% disease-free; N = 35).

MTH1 dephosphorylates oxidized nucleotides, thereby preventing their incorporation into DNA and protecting tumour cells from oxidative DNA damage. Inhibitors of MTH1 (TH588 and (S)-crizotinib) were shown to reduce cancer cell viability. However, the MTH1-dependency of the anti-cancer effects of these drugs has recently been questioned. Here, we have assessed anti-tumour effects of TH588 and (S)-crizotinib in patient-derived 3D colorectal cancer cultures. Hypoxia and reoxygenation – conditions that increase intracellular ROS levels – increased sensitivity to (S)-crizotinib, but not to TH588. (S)-crizotinib reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-MET and ErbB3 whereas TH588 induced a mitotic cell cycle arrest, which was not affected by adding ROS-modulating compounds. Furthermore, we show that both compounds induced DNA damage that could not be prevented by adding the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Moreover, adding ROS-modulating compounds did not alter the reduction in viability in response to TH588 and (S)-crizotinib. We conclude that TH588 and (S)-crizotinib have very clear and distinct anti-tumour effects in 3D colorectal cancer cultures, but that these effects most likely occur through distinct and ROS-independent mechanisms. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Histological iron imaging and contrast-agent free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect these deposits, but their presence in human cancer, and correlation with immunotherapeutic response is largely untested. Here, primarily using these iron imaging approaches, we evaluated the spatial distribution of polarized macrophage populations containing high endogenous levels of iron in preclinical murine models and human breast cancer, and used them as metabolic biomarkers to correlate TAM infiltration with response to immunotherapy in preclinical trials. Macrophage-targeted inhibition of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) by immunotherapy was confirmed to inhibit macrophage accumulation and slow mammary tumor growth in mouse models while also reducing hemosiderin iron-laden TAM accumulation as measured by both iron histology and in vivo iron MRI (FeMRI). Spatial profiling of TAM iron deposit infiltration defined regions of maximal accumulation and response to the CSF1R inhibitor, and revealed differences between microenvironments of human cancer according to levels of polarized macrophage iron accumulation in stromal margins. We therefore demonstrate that iron deposition serves as an endogenous metabolic imaging biomarker of TAM infiltration in breast cancer that has high translational potential for evaluation of immunotherapeutic response. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

The AP2 family also acts as a tumor suppressor. Here we found that p73 and AP2 are able to activate NEU4, a neuraminidase gene, which removes the terminal sialic acid residues from cancer-associated glycans. Under serum starvation, NEU4 was up-regulated and one of the NEU4 target glycans, sialyl Lewis X, was decreased, whereas p73 and AP2 were up-regulated. Sialyl Lewis X levels were not, however, decreased under starvation conditions in p73- or AP2-knockdown cells. p53 and AP2 underwent protein-protein interactions, exerting synergistic effects to activate p21, and interaction of p53 with AP2 was lost in cells expressing the L350P mutation of p53. The homologous residues in p63 and p73 are L423 and L377, respectively. The synergistic effect of p53/p63 with AP2 to activate genes was lost with the L350P/L423P mutation in p53/p63, but p73 bearing the L377P mutation was able to interact with AP2 and exerted its normal synergistic effects. We propose that p73 and AP2 synergistically activate the NEU4 promoter in colon cancer cells. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Treatment with increasing concentrations of HspNPs (25, 50, 75 and 100 µg/mL) resulted in 9.1-, 7-, 12.5- and 12.7-fold in increase in apoptotic cell number. Optimum doses of Hsp and HspNPs were found to increase oxidative damage in C6 glioma cells. MDA levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were found to be significantly elevated at 75 and 100 µg/mL exposure concentration of HspNPs with (p = .002) and (p = .018), respectively for 48-h treatment.

GO exhibits pH-dependent fluorescence emission in the visible/near-infrared, providing a possibility of molecular imaging and pH-sensing. It is also water soluble and has a substantial platform for functionalization, allowing for the delivery of multiple therapeutics. GO physical properties are modified to enhance cellular internalization, producing fluorescent nanoflakes with low (<15%) cytotoxicity at the imaging concentrations of 15 μg/mL. As a result, at lower flake sizes GO rapidly internalizes into HeLa cells with the following 70% fluorescence based clearance at 24 h, assessed by its characteristic emission in red/near-IR. pH-dependence of GO emission is utilized to provide the sensing of acidic extracellular environments of cancer cells. The results demonstrate diminishing green/red (550/630 nm) fluorescence intensity ratios for HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells in comparison to HEK-293 healthy cells suggesting a potential use of GO as a non-invasive optical sensor for cancer microenvironments.

        fabio:abstract    "Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells, represents early stages of metastasis and is a promising target in colorectal cancer (CRC) therapy. There have been many attempts to identify markers and key pathways induced throughout EMT but the process is complex and depends on the cancer type and tumour microenvironment. Here we used the colon cancer cell line HT29, which stably overexpressed Snail, the key transcription factor in early EMT, as a model for colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with a pro-metastatic phenotype. We investigated miRNA expression regulation during that phenotypic switching. We found that overexpression of Snail in HT29 cells triggered significant changes in individual miRNA levels but did not change the global efficiency of miRNA processing. Snail abundance repressed the expression of miR-192 and miR-194 and increased miR-205, let-7i and SNORD13 levels. These identified changes correlated with the reported transcriptomic alterations in Snail-overexpressing HT29 cells. We also investigated how Snail affected the miRNA content of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from HT29 cells. Our data suggest that the presence of Snail significantly alters the complex mRNA/miRNA interactions in the early steps of metastasis and also has an impact on the content of EVs released from HT29 cells. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Solid malignancies are associated with the development of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP). This study aimed to evaluate the risk factors for PJP among patients with lung cancer. This retrospective case-control study compared patients who had lung cancer with PJP (n = 112) or without PJP (n = 336) matched according to age, sex, histopathology, and stage. PJP definition was based on (i) positive PCR or direct immunofluorescence results for pneumocystis, (ii) clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities that were consistent with a pneumonic process, and (iii) received targeted PJP treatment. The development of PJP was associated with radiotherapy (RTx), concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRTx), lymphopenia, and prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (20 mg of prednisolone equivalent per day for ≥3 weeks). Multivariate analysis revealed independent associations with prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06–3.63; p = 0.032) and CCRTx (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.27–3.43; p = 0.004). Steroid use was frequently related to RTx pneumonitis or esophagitis (29 patients, 43.3%). Prolonged high-dose steroid therapy and CCRTx were risk factors for PJP development among patients with lung cancer. As these patients had a poor prognosis, clinicians should consider PJP prophylaxis for high-risk patients with lung cancer. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we compared The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) breast cancer genomic datasets (array and next generation sequencing (NGS) data) in detecting genomic alterations in clinically relevant genes. We performed an in silico analysis to determine the concordance in the frequencies of actionable mutations and copy number alterations/aberrations (CNAs) in the two most common breast cancer histologies, invasive lobular and invasive ductal carcinoma. We found that targeted sequencing identified a larger number of mutational hotspots and clinically significant amplifications that would have been missed by WES and SNP arrays in many actionable genes such as PIK3CA, EGFR, AKT3, FGFR1, ERBB2, ERBB3 and ESR1. The striking differences between the number of mutational hotspots and CNAs generated from these platforms highlight a number of factors that should be considered in the interpretation of array and NGS-based genomic data for precision medicine. Targeted panel sequencing was preferable to WES to define the full spectrum of somatic mutations present in a tumor. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Several oxaliplatin transporters were previously identified but their relative contributions to determining oxaliplatin tumour responses and gastrointestinal tumour cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin remains unclear. We studied clinical associations between tumour expression of oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes and patient response to oxaliplatin, then experimentally verified associations found with MRP2 in models of human gastrointestinal cancer. Among 18 oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes, MRP2 was the only one to be differentially expressed in the tumours of colorectal cancer patients who did or did not respond to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Over-expression of MRP2 (endogenously in HepG2 and PANC-1 cells, or induced by stable transfection of HEK293 cells) decreased oxaliplatin accumulation and cytotoxicity but those deficits were reversed by inhibition of MRP2 with myricetin or siRNA knockdown. Mice bearing subcutaneous HepG2 tumour xenografts were sensitised to oxaliplatin antitumour activity by concurrent myricetin treatment with little or no increase in toxicity. In conclusion, MRP2 limits oxaliplatin accumulation and response in human gastrointestinal cancer. Screening tumour MRP2 expression levels, to select patients for treatment with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy alone or in combination with a MRP2 inhibitor, could improve treatment outcomes. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

We compare optimized gene signatures for cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin responses in the same cell lines and validate each signature using data from patients with cancer. Supervised support vector machine learning is used to derive gene sets whose expression is related to the cell line GI50 values by backwards feature selection with cross-validation. Specific genes and functional pathways distinguishing sensitive from resistant cell lines are identified by contrasting signatures obtained at extreme and median GI50 thresholds. Ensembles of gene signatures at different thresholds are combined to reduce the dependence on specific GI50 values for predicting drug responses. The most accurate gene signatures for each platin are: cisplatin: BARD1, BCL2, BCL2L1, CDKN2C, FAAP24, FEN1, MAP3K1, MAPK13, MAPK3, NFKB1, NFKB2, SLC22A5, SLC31A2, TLR4, and TWIST1; carboplatin: AKT1, EIF3K, ERCC1, GNGT1, GSR, MTHFR, NEDD4L, NLRP1, NRAS, RAF1, SGK1, TIGD1, TP53, VEGFB, and VEGFC; and oxaliplatin: BRAF, FCGR2A, IGF1, MSH2, NAGK, NFE2L2, NQO1, PANK3, SLC47A1, SLCO1B1, and UGT1A1. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with bladder, ovarian, and colorectal cancer were used to test the cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin signatures, resulting in 71.0%, 60.2%, and 54.5% accuracies in predicting disease recurrence and 59%, 61%, and 72% accuracies in predicting remission, respectively. One cisplatin signature predicted 100% of recurrence in non-smoking patients with bladder cancer (57% disease-free; N = 19), and 79% recurrence in smokers (62% disease-free; N = 35).

MTH1 dephosphorylates oxidized nucleotides, thereby preventing their incorporation into DNA and protecting tumour cells from oxidative DNA damage. Inhibitors of MTH1 (TH588 and (S)-crizotinib) were shown to reduce cancer cell viability. However, the MTH1-dependency of the anti-cancer effects of these drugs has recently been questioned. Here, we have assessed anti-tumour effects of TH588 and (S)-crizotinib in patient-derived 3D colorectal cancer cultures. Hypoxia and reoxygenation – conditions that increase intracellular ROS levels – increased sensitivity to (S)-crizotinib, but not to TH588. (S)-crizotinib reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-MET and ErbB3 whereas TH588 induced a mitotic cell cycle arrest, which was not affected by adding ROS-modulating compounds. Furthermore, we show that both compounds induced DNA damage that could not be prevented by adding the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Moreover, adding ROS-modulating compounds did not alter the reduction in viability in response to TH588 and (S)-crizotinib. We conclude that TH588 and (S)-crizotinib have very clear and distinct anti-tumour effects in 3D colorectal cancer cultures, but that these effects most likely occur through distinct and ROS-independent mechanisms. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Histological iron imaging and contrast-agent free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect these deposits, but their presence in human cancer, and correlation with immunotherapeutic response is largely untested. Here, primarily using these iron imaging approaches, we evaluated the spatial distribution of polarized macrophage populations containing high endogenous levels of iron in preclinical murine models and human breast cancer, and used them as metabolic biomarkers to correlate TAM infiltration with response to immunotherapy in preclinical trials. Macrophage-targeted inhibition of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) by immunotherapy was confirmed to inhibit macrophage accumulation and slow mammary tumor growth in mouse models while also reducing hemosiderin iron-laden TAM accumulation as measured by both iron histology and in vivo iron MRI (FeMRI). Spatial profiling of TAM iron deposit infiltration defined regions of maximal accumulation and response to the CSF1R inhibitor, and revealed differences between microenvironments of human cancer according to levels of polarized macrophage iron accumulation in stromal margins. We therefore demonstrate that iron deposition serves as an endogenous metabolic imaging biomarker of TAM infiltration in breast cancer that has high translational potential for evaluation of immunotherapeutic response. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

The AP2 family also acts as a tumor suppressor. Here we found that p73 and AP2 are able to activate NEU4, a neuraminidase gene, which removes the terminal sialic acid residues from cancer-associated glycans. Under serum starvation, NEU4 was up-regulated and one of the NEU4 target glycans, sialyl Lewis X, was decreased, whereas p73 and AP2 were up-regulated. Sialyl Lewis X levels were not, however, decreased under starvation conditions in p73- or AP2-knockdown cells. p53 and AP2 underwent protein-protein interactions, exerting synergistic effects to activate p21, and interaction of p53 with AP2 was lost in cells expressing the L350P mutation of p53. The homologous residues in p63 and p73 are L423 and L377, respectively. The synergistic effect of p53/p63 with AP2 to activate genes was lost with the L350P/L423P mutation in p53/p63, but p73 bearing the L377P mutation was able to interact with AP2 and exerted its normal synergistic effects. We propose that p73 and AP2 synergistically activate the NEU4 promoter in colon cancer cells. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Treatment of C6 glioma cells with HspNPs for 24 and 48 h resulted in dose- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability, with approximate IC50 of 28 and 21 μg/mL, respectively (p = .036 for 24 h, p = .025 for 48 h). The percentage of PCNA positive cells decreased to 20% and 10%, respectively, for Hsp- and HspNP-treated cells at concentration of 100 µg/mL. Treatment with increasing concentrations of HspNPs (25, 50, 75 and 100 µg/mL) resulted in 9.1-, 7-, 12.5- and 12.7-fold in increase in apoptotic cell number. Optimum doses of Hsp and HspNPs were found to increase oxidative damage in C6 glioma cells. MDA levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were found to be significantly elevated at 75 and 100 µg/mL exposure concentration of HspNPs with (p = .002) and (p = .018), respectively for 48-h treatment.

GO exhibits pH-dependent fluorescence emission in the visible/near-infrared, providing a possibility of molecular imaging and pH-sensing. It is also water soluble and has a substantial platform for functionalization, allowing for the delivery of multiple therapeutics. GO physical properties are modified to enhance cellular internalization, producing fluorescent nanoflakes with low (<15%) cytotoxicity at the imaging concentrations of 15 μg/mL. As a result, at lower flake sizes GO rapidly internalizes into HeLa cells with the following 70% fluorescence based clearance at 24 h, assessed by its characteristic emission in red/near-IR. pH-dependence of GO emission is utilized to provide the sensing of acidic extracellular environments of cancer cells. The results demonstrate diminishing green/red (550/630 nm) fluorescence intensity ratios for HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells in comparison to HEK-293 healthy cells suggesting a potential use of GO as a non-invasive optical sensor for cancer microenvironments.

A total of 19,785 newly diagnosed CC patients were registered during 2010–2016, among them only 16,946 (85.6%) with primary CC tumor. There was no difference in treatment modality between DM and non-DM patients. However intergroup assessment showed that type 2DM have significantly higher rate of mortality in both overall mortality (28.3%) and CC-specific (11.7%) as compared to Type 1DM (17.3%; 5.5%) and non DM patients (12.7%; 9.1%) (p < 0.001). Within group assessments showed that Type 2DM patients have better quality of life (mean 7.13 ± 3.67) (p < 0.001) and less distress levels (mean 2.41 ± 0.63) (p < 0.011) as compared to type1 DM (meant 10.54 ± 2.11; 3.19 ± 1.07). This study concluded that T2DM prognostic effect still remained after adjusting demographic and clinical parameters. Type 1 diabetes mellitus showed better OS and CSS then type2 DM. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Despite the widening range of high-throughput platforms and exponential growth of generated data volume, the validation of biomarkers discovered from large-scale data remains a challenging field. In order to tackle cancer heterogeneity and comply with the data dimensionality, a number of network and pathway approaches were invented but rarely systematically applied to this task. We propose a new method, called NEAmarker, for finding sensitive and robust biomarkers at the pathway level. scores from network enrichment analysis transform the original space of altered genes into a lower-dimensional space of pathways. These dimensions are then correlated with phenotype variables. The method was first tested using in vitro data from three anti-cancer drug screens and then on clinical data of The Cancer Genome Atlas. It proved superior to the single-gene and alternative enrichment analyses in terms of (1) universal applicability to different data types with a possibility of cross-platform integration, (2) consistency of the discovered correlates between independent drug screens, and (3) ability to explain differential survival of treated patients. Our new screen of anti-cancer compounds validated the performance of multivariate models of drug sensitivity. The previously proposed methods of enrichment analysis could achieve comparable levels of performance in certain tests. However, only our method could discover predictors of both in vitro response and patient survival given administration of the same drug. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

SPIONs entrapped in the core of the nanocomplex may act as a hyperthermia agent and generate localized heat upon excitation with an alternating magnetic field (AMF), thus enabling a thermo-chemotherapy strategy for cancer treatment. Accordingly, the cytotoxic effect and the mode of cell death triggered by the nanocomplex in combination with AMF were evaluated on two different cancer cell lines with various folate receptor (FR) expression levels, including KB nasopharyngeal cancer cells overexpressing FRs as the model and MCF-7 breast cancer cells with low level of FRs as the blank sample. The obtained results showed that KB cell death was greater than the cell death observed in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, a majority of cell death in both cell lines were related to apoptosis when the folate-modified nanocomplex was used instated of the non-folate-modified nanocomplex. Therefore, functionalizing the nanocomplex with folate modulated the response to thermo-chemotherapy by shifting the cell death pathways toward apoptosis." ;

We examined TILs grades of pretreatment cancer tissue specimens and residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab and determined the predictive utility of the TILs grade in pathological complete response (pCR) and the prognostic power of TILs in HER2-positive breast cancer. This cohort study included 128 HER2-positive breast cancer who received NAC with trastuzumab. TILs grading of the tumor stroma in pretreatment biopsy specimens and residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab was categorized as low, intermediate, and high based on the criteria of the International Working Group. In current study, the pCR rate was 64.8%, and the Relapse-free survival (RFS) was significantly worse in the non-pCR group than in the pCR group. The pCR rate correlated with the TILs grade in pretreatment tumors. In 45 non-pCR patients, TILs grade was higher in the residual tumors than in the pretreatment tumors. The RFS was significantly better in residual tumors with high TILs grade than those with low TILs grade (p = 0.033). In conclusion, assessment of the TILs grade in residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab might be necessary to determine patients with good prognosis among those who do not achieve pCR. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

However, their clinical importance in gallbladder cancer has rarely been explored. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of surgical intervention and the effectiveness of preoperative test on neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) for predicting the prognosis in gallbladder cancer patients. In this study, a total of 255 gallbladder cancer patients were retrospectively selected. For each patient, we recorded his/her treatment algorithm (with or without surgery) and their preoperative inflammatory biomarkers, as well as their detailed survival information for 5 years. A total of 216 patients received surgical intervention and the other 39 chose conservative treatment. The median survival time was 4.6 months for non-surgical group (P < 0.001), and 12.2 months for surgical intervention group. Among the surgical group, ROC analysis showed the AUC of NLR, PLR and MLR were 0.675 (95% CI: 0.600 to 0.751, P < 0.001), 0.599 (95% CI: 0.520 to 0.677, P = 0.017) and 0.607 (95% CI: 0.529 to 0.686, P = 0.009), respectively.

        fabio:abstract    "Most targeting strategies of anticancer drug delivery systems (DDSs) rely on the surface functionalization of nanocarriers with specific ligands, which trigger the internalization in cancer cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The endocytosis implies the entrapment of DDSs in acidic vesicles (endosomes and lysosomes) and their eventual ejection by exocytosis. This process, intrinsic to eukaryotic cells, is one of the main drawbacks of DDSs because it reduces the drug bioavailability in the intracellular environment. The escape of DDSs from the acidic vesicles is, therefore, crucial to enhance the therapeutic performance at low drug dose. To this end, we developed a multifunctionalized DDS that combines high specificity towards cancer cells with endosomal escape capabilities. Doxorubicin-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles were functionalized with polyethylenimine, a polymer commonly used to induce endosomal rupture, and hyaluronic acid, which binds to CD44 receptors, overexpressed in cancer cells. We show irrefutable proof that the developed DDS can escape the endosomal pathway upon polymeric functionalization. Interestingly, the combination of the two polymers resulted in higher endosomal escape efficiency than the polyethylenimine coating alone. Hyaluronic acid additionally provides the system with cancer targeting capability and enzymatically controlled drug release. Thanks to this multifunctionality, the engineered DDS had cytotoxicity comparable to the pure drug whilst displaying high specificity towards cancer cells. The polymeric engineering here developed enhances the performance of DDS at low drug dose, holding great potential for anticancer therapeutic applications. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Using multiple aggressive murine models of triple-negative breast cancer, we have recently demonstrated that the early administration of oncolytic Maraba virus (MRB) prior to surgical resection of the primary tumor is sufficient to minimize the metastatic burden, protect against tumor rechallenge, cure a fraction of the mice and sensitize refractory tumors to immune checkpoint blockade without the need for further treatment. Here, we apply our surgical model to other OVs: Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Adenovirus (Ad), Reovirus (Reo) and Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and show that all of the tested OVs could positively change the outcome of the treated animals. The growth of the primary and secondary tumors was differently affected by the various OVs and most of the viruses conferred survival benefits in this neoadjuvant setting despite the absence of direct treatment following rechallenge.

Recent data indicate that p130Cas association to ErbB2 protects ErbB2 from degradation, thus enhancing tumorigenesis. Therefore, inhibiting p130Cas/ErbB2 interaction might represent a new therapeutic strategy to target breast cancer. Here we demonstrate by performing Molecular Modeling, Molecular Dynamics, dot blot, ELISA and fluorescence quenching experiments, that p130Cas binds directly to ErbB2. Then, by structure-based virtual screening, we identified two potential inhibitors of p130Cas/ErbB2 interaction. Their experimental validation was performed in vitro and in ErbB2-positive breast cancer cellular models. The results highlight that both compounds interfere with p130Cas/ErbB2 binding and significantly affect cell proliferation and sensitivity to Trastuzumab. Overall, this study identifies p130Cas/ErbB2 complex as a potential breast cancer target revealing new therapeutic perspectives for protein-protein interaction (PPI). © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

A large number of clinical applications have revealed that Trametes robiniophila Μurr. (Huaier) exhibits an anti-tumour effect. However, loss of the bioactive components of Huaier during the extraction procedure with water is unavoidable, and the underlying mechanism of the anti-cancer effect of Huaier remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer effect of Huaier n-butanol extract, which contained 51.4% total flavonoids, on HGC27, MGC803, and AGS human GC cell lines in vitro. At a low concentration, Huaier n-butanol extract inhibited the growth of these GC cell types, induced cell cycle arrest and reduced cell metastasis. Moreover, Huaier n-butanol extract suppressed the c-Myc-Bmi1 signalling pathway, and overexpression of Bmi1 reversed the effects of Huaier n-butanol extract on GC cells. Thus, our findings indicate that Huaier n-butanol extract suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of GC cells via a c-Myc-Bmi1-mediated approach, providing a new perspective for our understanding of the anti-tumour effects of Huaier. These results suggest that Huaier n-butanol extract could be an attractive therapeutic adjuvant for the treatment of human GC. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

In the present study, we screened the anticancer potential of supernatant metabolites from eight native haloarchaeal strains obtained from a culture collection in Iran. Five human cancer cell lines including breast, lung, prostate and also human fibroblast cells as the normal control were used in the present study. Moreover, to evaluate the anti-tumor effect of the selected supernatant, inhibition of sphere formation and tumor development was assessed in-vitro and in-vivo, respectively. Among all strains, supernatant metabolites from Halobacterium salinarum IBRC M10715 had the most potent cytotoxic effect on prostate cancer cell lines (IC50 = 0.5 mg/mL) without any effects on normal cells. It significantly increased both early and late apoptosis (about 11% and 9%, respectively) in the androgen-dependent PC3 cell line, reduced sphere formation ability of DU145 and PC3 cells with down-regulation of SOX2 gene expression. Furthermore, our results revealed that tumors developed in nude mice significantly shrank post intratumor injection of metabolites of the haloarchaeal strain. In conclusion, we suggested here for the first time that supernatant metabolites from Halobacterium salinarum IBRC M10715 could be a novel component against prostate cancer in-vitro and in-vivo with remarkable reduction in stem-like properties of tumor. © 2018, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

The main HNSCC risk factors are tobacco, excessive alcohol use, and the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV positive (+) cancers are etiologically different from other HNSCC and often show better prognosis. The current knowledge regarding HNSCC miRNA profiles is still incomplete especially in the context of HPV+ cancer. Thus, we analyzed 61 freshly collected primary oral (OSCC) and oropharyngeal (OPSCC) SCC samples. HPV DNA and RNA was found in 21% cases. The Illumina whole-genome small-RNA profiling by next-generation sequencing was done on 22 samples and revealed 7 specific miRNAs to HPV+ OSCC, 77 to HPV+ OPSCC, and additional 3 shared with both; 51 miRNAs were specific to HPV− OPSCC, 62 to HPV− OSCC, and 31 shared with both. The results for 9 miRNAs (miR-9, -21, -29a, -100, -106b, -143 and -145) were assessed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction on the whole study population. The data was additionally confirmed by reanalyzing publicly available miRNA sequencing Cancer Genome Atlas consortium (TCGA) HNSCC data. Cell signaling pathway analysis revealed differences between HPV+ and HPV− HNSCC. Our findings compared with literature data revealed extensive heterogeneity of miRNA deregulation with only several miRNAs consistently affected, and miR-9 being the most likely HPV related miRNA. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Resistance to 5-Fluorouracil chemotherapy is a major cause of therapeutic failure in colon cancer cure. Development of combined therapies constitutes an effective strategy to inhibit cancer cells and prevent the emergence of drug resistance. For this purpose, we investigated the anti-tumoral effect of thirteen phenolic compounds, from the Tunisian quince Cydonia oblonga Miller, alone or combined to 5-FU, on the human 5-FU-resistant LS174-R colon cancer cells in comparison to parental cells. Our results showed that only Kaempferol was able to chemo-sensitize 5-FU-resistant LS174-R cells. This phenolic compound combined with 5-FU exerted synergistic inhibitory effect on cell viability. This combination enhanced the apoptosis and induced cell cycle arrest of both chemo-resistant and sensitive cells through impacting the expression levels of different cellular effectors. Kaempferol also blocked the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and modulated the expression of JAK/STAT3, MAPK, PI3K/AKT and NF-κB. In silico docking analysis suggested that the potent anti-tumoral effect of Kaempferol, compared to its two analogs (Kaempferol 3-O-glucoside and Kampferol 3-O-rutinoside), can be explained by the absence of glucosyl groups. Overall, our data propose Kaempferol as a potential chemotherapeutic agent to be used alone or in combination with 5-FU to overcome colon cancer drug resistance. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Considering the high prevalence and mortality rate of colorectal cancer, in this study we tried to design and validate a standard printed form and evaluate oncologists’ and nurses’ adherence to this form. This cross-sectional study was performed in Omid hospital, Mashhad, Iran from January 2015 to October 2015. A Chemotherapy form including various demographic and clinical parameters and approved chemotherapy regimens for colorectal cancer was designed by the clinical pharmacist and validated by clinical oncologists working in this center. All eligible patients admitted in this center during this period of time were included in the study. Adherence of the oncologists and nurses to this form and probable medication errors were identified by the pharmacy student. Sixty-seven patients with colorectal cancer and a total of 251 chemotherapy courses were evaluated. All patients received regimens compatible with developed form but in 206 courses (98.56%) of chemotherapy dosing error happened and in most of cases patients received lower than calculated dose (37.8%). Three errors occurred in administration step by nurses which they infused the medication in shorter than recommended duration. In general, oncologists’ adherence with developed form for chemotherapy of colorectal cancer was relatively high, except in dose calculation. Avoiding from rounding the calculated medications’ doses and precise calculation of patients’ body surface area can prevent most of medication errors and reduce risk of adverse drug reaction occurrence. © 2018, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

Nevertheless, the importance of transfusion timing is still unclear. The primary purpose of this study is to appraise whether the receipt of intraoperative blood transfusion (BT) differ from postoperative BT in regards to cancer outcomes in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients treated with nephrectomy. Data on 1168 patients with RCC, who underwent radical or partial nephrectomy as primary therapy between 1988–2013 were analyzed. PBT was defined as transfusion of allogeneic red blood cells (RBC) during surgery or the postsurgical period. Survival was analyzed and compared using the Kaplan–Meier method with the log-rank test. Of 1168 patients, 198 patients (16.9%) received a PBT. Including 117 intraoperative BT and 81 postoperative BT. Only 21 (10.6%) patients required both intraoperative and postoperative BT. On multivariate analyses, receipt of PBT was associated with significantly worse local disease recurrence (HR: 2.4; P = 0.017), metastatic progression (HR: 2.7; P = 0.005), cancer-specific mortality (HR: 3.5; P = 0.002) and all-cause mortality (HR: 2.1; P = 0.005). Nevertheless, postoperative BT was not independently associated with increased risk of local recurrence (p = 0.1), metastatic progression (P = 0.16) or kidney cancer death (P = 0.63), yet did significantly increase the risk of overall mortality (HR: 2.6; P = 0.004). In the current study, intraoperative transfusion of allogeneic RBC is associated with increased risks of cancer recurrence and mortality following nephrectomy. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

For this reason novel therapies accounting for PDAC peculiarities, such as the relevant stromal reaction, are urgently needed. Here adipose mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (AD-MSC) have been armed to constantly release a soluble trimeric and multimeric variant of the known anti-cancer TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (sTRAIL). This cancer gene therapy strategy was in vitro challenged demonstrating that sTRAIL was thermally stable and able to induce apoptosis in the PDAC lines BxPC-3, MIA PaCa-2 and against primary PDAC cells. sTRAIL released by AD-MSC relocated into the tumor stroma was able to significantly counteract tumor growth in vivo with a significant reduction in tumor size, in cytokeratin-7+ cells and by an anti-angiogenic effect. In parallel, histology on PDAC specimens form patients (n = 19) was performed to investigate the levels of TRAIL DR4, DR5 and OPG receptors generating promising insights on the possible clinical translation of our approach. These results indicate that adipose MSC can very efficiently vehicle a novel TRAIL variant opening unexplored opportunities for PDAC treatment. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Therefore, identification of novel therapeutic targets involved in melanoma progression is urgently needed for developing effective therapeutic methods. Overexpression of interleukin-13 receptor α2 (IL13Rα2) is observed in several cancer types including glioma and pancreatic cancer. Although IL13Rα2 is implicated in the progression of various types of cancer, its expression and roles in the malignant melanoma have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we showed that IL13Rα2 was expressed in approximately 7.5% melanoma patients. While IL13Rα2 expression in human melanoma cells decreased their proliferation in vitro, it promoted in vivo tumour growth and angiogenesis in melanoma xenograft mouse model. We also found that the expression of amphiregulin, a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, was correlated with IL13Rα2 expression in cultured melanoma cells, xenograft tumour tissues and melanoma clinical samples. Furthermore, expression of amphiregulin promoted tumour growth, implicating causal relationship between the expression of IL13Rα2 and amphiregulin. These results suggest that IL13Rα2 enhances tumorigenicity by inducing angiogenesis in malignant melanoma, and serves as a potential therapeutic target of malignant melanoma. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Experiment in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines demonstrated up-regulation of PKD2 led to high expression of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vim, mmp9 et al.) and EMT transcription factors(zeb1, twist, snail), and the results were reversed when PKD2 was knocked down. Further investigation showed that abrogation of PKD2 inhibited A549 cell migration, invasion, proliferation and induced cell arrest in G2/M phase.

We showed for the first time that Raman imaging can be used to distinguish successfully between glycosylated and nonglycosylated proteins in normal and cancer tissue. Thousands of protein, lipid and glycan species exist in cells and tissues and their metabolism is monitored via numerous pathways, networks and methods. The metabolism can change in response to cellular environment alterations, such as development of a disease. Measuring such alterations and understanding the pathways involved are crucial to fully understand cellular metabolism in cancer development. In this paper Raman markers of glycogen, glycosaminoglycan, chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate proteoglycan were identified based on their vibrational signatures. High spatial resolution of Raman imaging combined with chemometrics allows separation of individual species from many chemical components present in each cell. We have found that metabolism of proteins, lipids and glycans is markedly deregulated in breast (adenocarcinoma) and brain (medulloblastoma) tumors. We have identified two glycoforms in the normal breast tissue and the malignant brain tissue in contrast to the breast cancer tissue where only one glycoform has been identified. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate anti-cancer effects of NLC-Citral in MDA MB-231 cells in vitro through the Annexin V, cell cycle, JC-1 and fluorometric assays. Additionally, this study is aimed to effects of NLC-Citral in reducing the tumor weight and size in 4T1 induced murine breast cancer model. Results showed that NLC-Citral induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest in MDA MB-231 cells. Furthermore, a prominent anti-metastatic ability of NLC-Citral was demonstrated in vitro using scratch, migration and invasion assays. A significant reduction of migrated and invaded cells was observed in the NLC-Citral treated MDA MB-231 cells. To further evaluate the apoptotic and anti-metastatic mechanism of NLC-Citral at the molecular level, microarray-based gene expression and proteomic profiling were conducted. Based on the result obtained, NLC-Citral was found to regulate several important signaling pathways related to cancer development such as apoptosis, cell cycle, and metastasis signaling pathways. Additionally, gene expression analysis was validated through the targeted RNA sequencing and real-time polymerase chain reaction. In conclusion, the NLC-Citral inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells in vitro, majorly through the induction of apoptosis, anti-metastasis, anti-angiogenesis potentials, and reducing the tumor weight and size without altering the therapeutic effects of citral. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The incidence of developing cancer should increase with the body mass, yet is not the case, a conundrum referred to as Peto’s paradox. Elephants have a lower incidence of cancer suggesting that these animals have probably evolved different ways to protect themselves against the disease. The paradox is worth revisiting with the realization that most mammals encode an endogenous APOBEC3 cytidine deaminase capable of mutating single stranded DNA. Indeed, the mutagenic activity of some APOBEC3 enzymes has been shown to introduce somatic mutations into genomic DNA. These enzymes are now recognized as causal agent responsible for the accumulation of CG- > TA transitions and DNA breaks leading to chromosomal rearrangements in human cancer genomes. Here, we identified an elephant A3Z1 gene, related to human APOBEC3A and showed that it could efficiently deaminate cytidine, 5-methylcytidine and produce DNA breaks leading to massive apoptosis, similar to other mammalian APOBEC3A enzymes where body mass varies by up to four orders of magnitude. Consequently, it could be considered that eAZ1 might contribute to cancer in elephants in a manner similar to their proposed role in humans. If so, eAZ1 might be particularly well regulated to counter Peto’s paradox. © 2018, The Author(s)." ;

Biotin-PEG-PCL polymers have been used for targeted drug delivery to cancer, as well as to improve the pharmacokinetics of the drug and reduce its effects. In this study, biotin-conjugated copolymers were fabricated with polymerization of the ring opening method and the properties of copolymer and nanoparticles were investigated using various techniques. The toxicity of artemisinin and its nanoparticles have been investigated on MCF-7 and normal HFF2 cells. The results showed that the encapsulation efficacy of artemisinin in nanoparticles was 45.5 ± 0.41%. The release profile of the drug indicates that the release is slow and controlled and is approximately pH dependent. The results of artemisinin cell culture on human breast cancer cells showed that biotin-PEG-PCL nanoparticles had an inhibitory effect on MCF-7 cells and had no toxic effects on HFF2 cells. Anticancer activity in vivo in the 4T1 breast cancer model showed that tumour volumes were decreased up 40 mm3 by ART-loaded micelles and 76 mm3 by free ART, compared to the control group (2150 mm). In vivo results showed that this formulation significantly increases the accumulation of substances in the tumours. Therefore, the molecular formulation of ART-based copolymers can be a desirable process for cancer treatment purposes. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group." ;

        fabio:abstract    "n-Butylidenephthalide (BP) is a potential anti-cancer drug, which can be extracted from Angelica sinensis (Danggui). Previous reports have shown the effectiveness of BP in treating cancer diseases. However, BP has no targeting capacity towards specific cancer cells. To improve treatment efficiency and reduce the dose of BP used in cancer treatment, targeting-based approaches should be developed. In the present study, we used riboflavin-5′-phosphate (RFMP) immobilized iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4 MNPs) as carriers for BP to treat cancer cell lines derived from liver, prostate and breast. These model cancer cells overexpress riboflavin receptors on their cell membrane and are also sensitive to BP treatment. Thus, BP-binding free RFMP on MNPs can be used as probes to target these model cells, whereas BP can be readily released on target cancer cells. Cell viability was twofold lower by using Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs immobilized with BP than that achieved by using free-form BP at a similar amount. Moreover, BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs have no apparent harmful effects on non-target cells. In addition, we evaluated the level of cysteine-aspartic acid protease 3 (caspase 3) in the resultant cell lysate obtained after treatment by BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs to demonstrate that apoptosis is mainly involved in the growth inhibition of target cells. © 2017, © 2017 The Author(s).

The aim of this national population-based retrospective study was to analyze the relationship between MetS and the incidence of laryngeal cancer. Patients with laryngeal cancer (ICD-10: C32) between 2009 and 2010 were retrospectively identified and tracked until 2015 using the Korean Health Insurance claims database. During the seven-year follow-up period, 5,322 subjects were newly diagnosed with larynx cancer. The mean age of people with laryngeal cancer was much higher than those without (63.29 vs. 47.7 years, p < 0.0001), and the incidence of larynx cancer in men was much higher than that in women (93.16% vs. 6.84%, p < 0.0001). Age, gender, smoking status, alcohol intake, and exercise-adjusted hazard ratios indicated that participants with MetS had a 1.13-fold higher hazard of having larynx cancer than those without MetS. The number of MetS components was a strong risk factor for laryngeal cancer with a higher risk estimate of this cancer in both ex- and current smokers as well as people who have never smoked. MetS was found to be an independent risk factor for the incidence of laryngeal cancer. In Korea, MetS and its components are significantly associated with the development of laryngeal cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

In this study, we demonstrated that FLOT2 expression levels were greatly upregulated in glioma tissues and cell lines, and the FLOT2 expression in glioma tissue was markedly associated with tumour stage and size. Overexpression of FLOT2 was correlated with poor prognosis of glioma patients. The functional assay revealed that silenced FLOT2 repressed the viability, migration, and invasion of glioma cells. And then, we detected the relationship between miR-449 and FLOT2. Luciferase reporter assay and Western blot results showed that miR-449 directly binding the 3′UTR sequence of FLOT2 and regulated FLOT2 expression in glioma cells. Finally, we detected the expression levels of miR-449 in glioma tissue and cell lines and found that miR-449 was significantly downregulated in glioma tissues and cell lines. In conclusion, we demonstrated that overexpression FLOT2 was associated with poor prognosis of glioma patients and involved in the progression of glioma, identifying a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for glioma progression. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group." ;

One of the consequences of chromosomal rearrangement is gene fusions in the cancer genome. We have previously identified a panel of fusion genes in aggressive prostate cancers. In this study, we showed that 6 of these fusion genes are present in 7 different types of human malignancies with variable frequencies. Among them, the CCNH-C5orf30 and TRMT11-GRIK2 gene fusions were found in breast cancer, colon cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, ovarian cancer and liver cancer, with frequencies ranging from 12.9% to 85%. In contrast, four other gene fusions (mTOR-TP53BP1, TMEM135-CCDC67, KDM4-AC011523.2 and LRRC59-FLJ60017) are less frequent. Both TRMT11-GRIK2 and CCNH-C5orf30 are also frequently present in lymph node metastatic cancer samples from the breast, colon and ovary. Thus, detecting these fusion transcripts may have significant biological and clinical implications in cancer patient management. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Quantifying the genetic correlation between cancers can provide important insights into the mechanisms driving cancer etiology. Using genome-wide association study summary statistics across six cancer types based on a total of 296,215 cases and 301,319 controls of European ancestry, here we estimate the pair-wise genetic correlations between breast, colorectal, head/neck, lung, ovary and prostate cancer, and between cancers and 38 other diseases. We observed statistically significant genetic correlations between lung and head/neck cancer (r g = 0.57, p = 4.6 × 10 −8 ), breast and ovarian cancer (r g = 0.24, p = 7 × 10 −5 ), breast and lung cancer (r g = 0.18, p =1.5 × 10 −6 ) and breast and colorectal cancer (r g = 0.15, p = 1.1 × 10 −4 ). We also found that multiple cancers are genetically correlated with non-cancer traits including smoking, psychiatric diseases and metabolic characteristics.

        fabio:abstract    "Purpose: Several previous studies have shown that oral bisphosphonates (BPs) are associated with the incidence of 13 specific cancers, including lung cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the findings are heterogeneous. Methods and results: Relevant studies published in databases such as PubMed, Embase database, and Cochrane library were systematically retrieved from inception to August 25th, 2017, regardless of language, by two investigators independently. Afterwards, the maximum adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted from the retrieved studies. Finally, 13 cohort studies involving 1,510,763 participants were enrolled into this meta-analysis. No significant relationship was found between oral BPs and the risk of all-cause cancer in osteoporosis (OP) patients among the entire population (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80–1.18; I 2 92.5%). Besides, oral BPs could remarkably reduce the incidence of breast cancer (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68–0.92; I 2 54%) and endometrial cancer (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64–0.96; I 2 0%) in postmenopausal OP females. In addition, oral BPs were also found to evidently reduce the incidence of upper gastrointestinal cancer in OP patients among the entire population (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54–0.98; I 2 36.1%). However, oral BPs may lead to increased risk of liver cancer in mixed genders (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.03–2.77; I 2 30.7%). Conclusions: Taken together, oral BPs do not increase the risk of incidence of all-cause cancer; instead, they can reduce the incidence of breast, endometrial, and upper gastrointestinal cancers among the postmenopausal OP females. Our analysis stratified by gender suggests that oral BPs may increase the incidence of liver cancer in mixed genders, while no significant association was observed in females. Careful analysis of post-marketing data should be conducted to address the clinical relevance of our results on the putative association of oral BP use and liver cancer suggested by our meta-analysis. © 2017, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation." ;

However, it remains unclear how cancer cells migrate in the three-dimensional (3D) matrix of cancer tissues and how CAFs support the cancer invasion. Here we propose a novel mechanism of fibroblast-dependent cancer cell invasion in the 3D collagen matrix. Human cancer cell lines from the pancreas (Panc-1), lung (A549) and some other organs actively adhered to normal fibroblasts and primary lung CAFs in cultures. To show its significance in tumor invasion, we designed a new invasion assay in which homogeneous microspheroids consisting of cancer cells and fibroblasts were embedded into collagen gel. Time-lapse experiments showed that cancer cells adhered to and quickly migrated on the long protrusions of fibroblasts in the 3D collagen matrix. Fibroblast-free cancer cells poorly invaded the matrix. Experiments with function-blocking antibodies, siRNAs, and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that cancer cells adhered to fibroblasts through integrin α5β1-mediated binding to fibronectin on the surface of fibroblasts. Immunochemical analyses of the co-cultures and lung cancers suggested that cancer cells could acquire the migratory force by the fibronectin/integrin signaling. Our results also revealed that the fibroblast-bound fibronectin was a preferential substrate for cancer cells to migrate in the collagen matrix. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

However, very few studies investigated the role of integrin α3 (ITGα3) in malignant cancers. Here, we determined the functional role of ITGα3 in pancreatic cancer. Analysis of public microarray databases and Western blot analysis indicated a unique expression of ITGα3 in human pancreatic cancer. Silencing ITGα3 expression significantly inhibited the viability and migration of human pancreatic cancer cells. Notably, ablation of ITGα3 expression resulted in a significant decrease of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression compared with transfection of control-siRNA through an increased number of leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domain protein 1 (LRIG1) expression. In addition, ablating ITGα3 inhibited tumour growth via blockade of EGFR signalling in vivo. Furthermore, the highly expressed ITGα3 led to a poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. Our results provide novel insights into ITGα3-induced aggressive pancreatic cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Since epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in promoting metastasis of cancer, many mechanisms regarding EMT have been studied. We previously showed that Ribonucleic acid export 1 (RAE1) is dysregulated in breast cancer and its overexpression leads to aggressive breast cancer phenotypes by inducing EMT. Here, we evaluated the functional capacity of RAE1 in breast cancer metastasis by using a three-dimensional (3D) culture system and xenograft models. Furthermore, to investigate the mechanisms of RAE1-driven EMT, in vitro studies were carried out. The induction of EMT with RAE1-overexpression was confirmed under the 3D culture system and in vivo system. Importantly, RAE1 mediates upregulation of an EMT marker ZEB1, by binding to the promoter region of ZEB1. Knockdown of ZEB1 in RAE1-overexpressing cells suppressed invasive and migratory behaviors, accompanied by an increase in epithelial and a decrease in mesenchymal markers. Taken together, these data demonstrate that RAE1 contributes to breast cancer metastasis by regulating a key EMT-inducing factor ZEB1 expression, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Obesity is a risk factor for many cancers including breast, esophageal, colon, and thyroid cancer. We aimed to evaluate the association of thyroid cancer with body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and weight change. This nationwide population-based cohort study included 11,323,006 adults who joined the national health screening program. Weight change was defined as the difference between the weight of the subjects measured during the study period and the weight at the time of four years ago. For evaluating the association between the weight change and the risk of thyroid cancer, subjects without weight change for four years were defined as the reference group. Mean age was 50.1 ± 13.7 years and 44% were female. In total, 50,464 subjects (0.4%) had newly-diagnosed thyroid cancer. After multivariable analyses, the incidence of thyroid cancer increased significantly in subjects with larger WC as well as higher BMI (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). In subjects who were lean and became obese, the incidence of thyroid cancers increased significantly (hazard ratio [HR] 1.15 [1.11–1.19]). In subjects who were obese and became lean, the incidence of thyroid cancers decreased significantly (HR 0.89 [0.86–0.93]). These results demonstrated that higher BMI and larger WC were significantly associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer. Weight gain in lean subjects was associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer, and weight reduction in subjects with obesity was associated with a decreased risk of thyroid cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

In order to understand this increase, country specific dietary exposures have been investigated. The aim of this study was to quantify the association between consumption of brown cheese, a common bread topping in Norway, and colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer in the prospective Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) Study. Data on brown cheese consumption and adjustment factors was available for 82 527 women. During a mean of 14.6 years of follow-up (1.2 million person-years), there were 1360 cases of colorectal cancer (907 colon; 453 rectal). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer sites. We modelled restricted cubic splines with 4 knots, to assess a possible non-linear relationship between brown cheese intake and the investigated cancer sites. In the age-adjusted model, consumption of more than 2 slices (>16 grams) of brown cheese per day was associated with 13% reduced risk of colon cancer (95% CI 4%-21%) compared to women who did not consume brown cheese. The multivariable-adjusted model, however, showed no association between brown cheese consumption and the risk of colorectal, colon, or rectal cancer (colorectal: HR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.76–1.13, p-trend 0.37; colon: HR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.65–1.06; p-trend = 0.10; rectal: HR = 1.16, 95% CI 0.84–1.1.61, p-trend = 0.41). In this large, prospective cohort study of women, consumption of brown cheese was suggestively protective against colon cancer. However, adjustment attenuated the inverse risk association. Brown cheese consumption was not associated with rectal cancer, or colorectal cancer overall. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Current cancer diagnosis utilizes histopathology, which requires tissue acquisition, extensive processing and, in most cases, relies on the qualitative morphological analysis of tissues and cells. Molecular biomarkers are only available for a few specific tumor subtypes. We discovered that the fluorescence polarization (Fpol) of Methylene Blue (MB) is significantly higher in cancer than in normal human breast tissues and cells. We confirmed that fluorescence polarization imaging did not affect the viability of the cells and yielded highly significant differences between cancer and normal cells using MB concentrations as low as 0.05 and 0.01 mg/ml. To explain this phenomenon we examined intracellular localization of MB and its fluorescence lifetime. We determined that higher fluorescence polarization of MB occurs due to its increased accumulation in mitochondria of cancer cells, as well as shorter fluorescence lifetime in cancer relative to normal cells. As quantitative MB Fpol imaging can be performed in vivo and in real time, it holds the potential to provide an accurate quantitative marker of cancer at the cellular level. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

The anticancer polymers are designed to target anionic lipids exposed on the cancer cell surfaces and act by disrupting the cancer cell membranes. Because the polymer mechanism is not dependent on cell proliferation, we hypothesized that the polymers were active against dormant cancer cells. The polymers exhibited cytotoxicity to proliferating prostate cancer. Importantly, the polymer killed dormant prostate cancer cells that were resistant to docetaxel. This study demonstrates a new approach to discover novel anticancer therapeutics. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

We developed a novel computational platform applying a multi-modal approach to filter out passengers and more robustly identify putative driver genes. The primary filter identifies enrichment of cancer mutations in CATH functional families (CATH-FunFams) – structurally and functionally coherent sets of evolutionary related domains. Using structural representatives from CATH-FunFams, we subsequently seek enrichment of mutations in 3D and show that these mutation clusters have a very significant tendency to lie close to known functional sites or conserved sites predicted using CATH-FunFams. Our third filter identifies enrichment of putative driver genes in functionally coherent protein network modules confirmed by literature analysis to be cancer associated. Our approach is complementary to other domain enrichment approaches exploiting Pfam families, but benefits from more functionally coherent groupings of domains. Using a set of mutations from 22 cancers we detect 151 putative cancer drivers, of which 79 are not listed in cancer resources and include recently validated cancer associated genes EPHA7, DCC netrin-1 receptor and zinc-finger protein ZNF479. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Cox proportional hazards models were used. Males and females classified as obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg /m −2 ) have a 33% and 22% increased risk of all-cancer, respectively, than their normal weight counterparts. Similar all-cancer risk increases are observed for those above sex-specific WC guidelines.

Collectively, 86.3% (63/73) of HAMPs have recurrent alterations in at least 1 cancer type and 16 HAMPs, including 9 understudied HAMPs, are identified as putative therapeutic targets across multiple cancer types. For example, the recurrent focal amplification of BRD9 is observed in 9 cancer types and genetic depletion of BRD9 inhibits tumor growth.

        fabio:abstract    "The current system for evaluating prostate cancer architecture is the Gleason grading system which divides the morphology of cancer into five distinct architectural patterns, labeled 1 to 5 in increasing levels of cancer aggressiveness, and generates a score by summing the labels of the two most dominant patterns. The Gleason score is currently the most powerful prognostic predictor of patient outcomes; however, it suffers from problems in reproducibility and consistency due to the high intra-observer and inter-observer variability amongst pathologists. In addition, the Gleason system lacks the granularity to address potentially prognostic architectural features beyond Gleason patterns. We evaluate prostate cancer for architectural subtypes using techniques from topological data analysis applied to prostate cancer glandular architecture. In this work we demonstrate the use of persistent homology to capture architectural features independently of Gleason patterns. Specifically, using persistent homology, we compute topological representations of purely graded prostate cancer histopathology images of Gleason patterns 3,4 and 5, and show that persistent homology is capable of clustering prostate cancer histology into architectural groups through a ranked persistence vector. Our results indicate the ability of persistent homology to cluster prostate cancer histopathology images into unique groups with dominant architectural patterns consistent with the continuum of Gleason patterns. In addition, of particular interest, is the sensitivity of persistent homology to identify specific sub-architectural groups within single Gleason patterns, suggesting that persistent homology could represent a robust quantification method for prostate cancer architecture with higher granularity than the existing semi-quantitative measures. The capability of these topological representations to segregate prostate cancer by architecture makes them an ideal candidate for use as inputs to future machine learning approaches with the intent of augmenting traditional approaches with topological features for improved diagnosis and prognosis. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Accumulative studies demonstrate that UHRF1 is broadly overexpressed in cancers, which contributes to cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Interestingly, a proteasome-dependent downregulation of UHRF1 has been observed in pluripotent ground state mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) cultured in the presence of two kinase (MEK1/MEK2 and GSK3β) inhibitors (termed 2i), raising the question whether UHRF1 is similarly regulated in cancer cells. Here we present evidence that while addition of 2i broadly downregulates UHRF1 and DNMT1 in various cancer cells, distinct underlying mechanisms are involved. In contrast to mESCs, 2i-induced downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in cancer cells cannot be rescued by proteasome inhibitor and occurs primarily at the level of transcription. Furthermore, downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 by 2i is due to inhibition of MEK1/MEK2, but not GSK3β activity. Data mining reveals a marked co-expression of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in normal tissues as well as cancers. We provide evidence that multiple transcription factors including E2F1 and SP1 mediate the transcriptional activation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 by the activated MEK/ERK pathway. Together our study reveals distinct regulation of UHRF1/DNMT1 in mESCs and cancer cells and identifies activated MEK/ERK pathway as a driving force for coordinated and aberrant over-expression of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in cancers. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

When it is applied to cancer cells, solid stress hinders their proliferation rate and promotes cancer cell invasion and metastatic potential.

Here, we used two pancreatic cancer cell lines and an established in vitro system to study the effect of solid stress-induced signal transduction on pancreatic cancer cell migration as well as the mechanism involved. Our results show that the migratory ability of cells increases as a direct response to solid stress. We also found that Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) expression and secretion is strongly upregulated in pancreatic cancer cells in response to mechanical compression. Performing a phosphoprotein screening, we identified that solid stress activates the Akt/CREB1 pathway to transcriptionally regulate GDF15 expression, which eventually promotes pancreatic cancer cell migration. Our results suggest a novel solid stress signal transduction mechanism bringing GDF15 to the centre of pancreatic tumor biology and rendering it a potential target for future anti-metastatic therapeutic innovations. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a cancer treatment that make use of the cancer-specific accumulation of porphyrins. We have reported that mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mitROS) upregulate uptake transporter of porphyrins, heme carrier protein-1 (HCP-1). The accumulation of cancer-specific porphyrins was increased by mitROS production, thereby the cancer-specific PDT cytotoxicity was enhanced. Thus we investigated whether mitROS production by hyperthermia can enhanced the cytotoxicity of PDT or not. In this study, 1 h of hyperthermia at 42 °C increased the mitROS production, and both the accumulation of cancer-specific porphyrins and the PDT cytotoxicity increased. Moreover, the authors treated cells with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) to examine the effect of mitROS. NAC inhibited the increasing ROS production after hyperthermia to restrain the post-treatment increase of cancer-specific porphyrins accumulation. Moreover, the increase of ROS production in cancer cells after hyperthermia upregulated HCP-1 expression and downregulated ABCG2 expression. These regulation were inhibited by NAC. These results suggest that hyperthermia treatment increased mitROS production, which involved HpD accumulation and enhanced PDT effects in cancer cells. The mechanism of this phenomenon was most likely to be due to both the upregulation of HCP-1 and the downregulation of ABCG2 by mitROS. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Recent studies showed that changes to the gut microbiome alters the microbiome-derived metabolome, potentially promoting carcinogenesis in organs that are distal to the gut. In this study, we assessed the relationship between breast cancer and cadaverine biosynthesis. Cadaverine treatment of Balb/c female mice (500 nmol/kg p.o. q.d.) grafted with 4T1 breast cancer cells ameliorated the disease (lower mass and infiltration of the primary tumor, fewer metastases, and lower grade tumors). Cadaverine treatment of breast cancer cell lines corresponding to its serum reference range (100–800 nM) reverted endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, inhibited cellular movement and invasion, moreover, rendered cells less stem cell-like through reducing mitochondrial oxidation. Trace amino acid receptors (TAARs), namely, TAAR1, TAAR8 and TAAR9 were instrumental in provoking the cadaverine-evoked effects. Early stage breast cancer patients, versus control women, had reduced abundance of the CadA and LdcC genes in fecal DNA, both responsible for bacterial cadaverine production. Moreover, we found low protein expression of E. coli LdcC in the feces of stage 1 breast cancer patients. In addition, higher expression of lysine decarboxylase resulted in a prolonged survival among early-stage breast cancer patients. Taken together, cadaverine production seems to be a regulator of early breast cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

The specific function of CBX6 in breast cancer is currently undefined. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset led to the identification of CBX6 as a consistently downregulated gene in breast cancer. We provided evidence showing enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) negatively regulated CBX6 expression in a Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)-dependent manner. Exogenous overexpression of CBX6 inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation, and induced cell cycle arrest along with suppression of migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro. Microarray analyses revealed that CBX6 governs a complex gene expression program. Moreover, CBX6 induced significant downregulation of bone marrow stromal cell antigen-2 (BST2), a potential therapeutic target, via interactions with its promoter region. Our collective findings support a tumor suppressor role of CBX6 in breast cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "MRI plays important roles in endometrial and cervical cancer assessment, from detection to recurrent disease evaluation. Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common malignant tumor of the female genital tract in Western countries. EC patients are divided into risk categories based on histopathological tumor type, grade, and myometrial invasion depth. EC is surgically staged using the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) system. Since FIGO (2009) stage correlates with prognosis, preoperative staging is essential for tailored treatment. MRI reveals myometrial invasion depth, which correlates with tumor grade and lymph node metastases, and thus correlates with prognosis. Cervical cancer (CC) is the second most common cancer, and the third leading cause of cancer-related death among females in developing countries. The FIGO Gynecologic Oncology Committee recently revised its CC staging guidelines, allowing staging based on imaging and pathological findings when available. The revised FIGO (2017) staging includes node involvement and thus enables both therapy selection and evaluation, prognosis estimation, and calculation of end results. MRI can accurately assess prognostic indicators, e.g., tumor size, parametrial invasion, pelvic sidewall, and lymph node invasion. Despite these important roles of MRI, radiologists still face challenges due to the technical and interpretation pitfalls of MRI during all phases of endometrial and cervical cancer evaluation. Awareness of mimics that can simulate both cancers is critical. With careful application, functional MRI with DWI and DCE sequences can help establish a correct diagnosis, although it is sometimes necessary to perform biopsy and histopathological analysis. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

This led to the first biological based liquid biopsy test, which we called MATER-D platform. In the present study, we showed for the first time that a different type of OMCs (PTEN-deficient human epithelial MCF10A cells) turn malignant when exposed to cancer patient’s sera, confirming the concept that different cells with diverse oncosuppressor mutations can uptake cancer factors and be used in biological based liquid biopsy tests. Our observations were confirmed in a large variety of solid and haematological malignancies. This test was able to detect dysplasia and carcinomas in situ lesions in different organs and circulating factors in cancer patients years after the removal of their lesions. To our knowledge, this ability is unique and not shared by other liquid biopsy platforms. Immunohistochemistry analysis of the xenotransplants revealed identical patterns of differentiation regardless of the cancer type, showing that differentiation through horizontal transfer might be dependent on the nature of the target cells rather than the type of cancer factors. These data strengthen the notion that OMC-based liquid biopsy tests might be promising platforms for cancer screening. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Various studies have shown the significance of identifying drug targets for cancer, although this process continues challenging in the field of anti-cancer drug designing. The primary purpose of this study is to design a novel approach to identify target genes for cancer. The sub-network of colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancers were constructed from human protein–protein interaction network. The potential genes were analyzed using hubs and centrality measures. For the identification of target genes, we retrieve those genes that had the highest score in both mutation rates and graph centrality. Moreover, gene deletion analysis revealed that MYC, TP53, and EGFR genes remained potential targets in colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancer respectively. Results suggest that combining network measures with mutation frequencies in cancer genes might assist in recognizing several potential drug targets. Future enhancement of this current approach is to combine these network properties with the biological insights from gene expression data, and their functions will provide a reliable method for rational drug designing. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature." ;

Owing to enhanced permeability and retention in solid tumor tissue, nanoparticle (NP) delivery systems have been emerged as novel strategy in cancer chemotherapy. As extracellular matrix, glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) could bind its surface receptor adhesion molecule CD44 which is strongly expressed on breast cancer. We have previously reported a doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded HA-Lys-LA X-NPs (X-NP-DOX) NP delivery system for breast cancer treatment. In this study, we further investigated the antitumor effect of X-NP-DOX NP delivery system using low-dose DOX in both in vitro and in vivo systems. We demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX possessed the ability for inhibiting MCF-7 breast cancer cell growth, invasion, and migration, and inducing apoptosis in vitro. In in vivo experiments, injection of low-dose X-NP-DOX into tumor-bearing mouse resulted in significant reduction of tumor size. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining further revealed that low-dose X-NP-DOX induced higher percentage of apoptotic cells compared with free DOX or saline. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX inhibited Notch1 and Ras/MAPK pathways, decreased cancer stem cell population, and reduced tumorigenesis compared to free DOX in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Owing to its enhanced efficacy and higher targetability compared to free DOX, low-dose DOX delivered by NP system may be a promising novel strategy for breast cancer treatment." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Breast cancer survivors display altered inflammatory responses to immune challenges relative to cancer-naive controls likely due to previous cancer treatments, stress associated with cancer, and/or tumor physiology. Proper inflammatory responses are necessary for adaptive sickness behaviors (e.g., fatigue, anorexia, and fever) and neuroinflammatory pathways are also implicated in mental health disturbances (e.g., cognitive impairment, depression) suffered by cancer patients and survivors. Rodent cancer models indicate that tumors are sufficient to exacerbate neuroinflammatory responses after an immune challenge, however primary tumors are not usually present in cancer survivors, and the behavioral consequences of these brain changes remain understudied. Therefore, we tested the extent to which mammary tumor resection attenuates tumor-induced neuroinflammation and sickness behavior following an immune challenge (i.p. lipopolysaccharide [LPS] injection) in mice. Tnf-α, Il-1β, and Il-6 mRNA decreased in multiple brain regions of LPS-treated tumor-bearing mice relative to LPS-treated controls; tumor resection attenuated these effects in some cases (but not Tnf-α). Tumors also attenuated sickness behaviors (hypothermia and lethargy) compared to LPS-treated controls. Tumor resection reversed these behavioral consequences, although basal body temperature remained elevated, comparable to tumor-bearing mice. Thus, tumors significantly modulate neuroinflammatory pathways with functional consequences and tumor resection mitigates most, but not all, of these changes. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Natural compounds are a realistic source of new bioactive compounds with anticancer activity. Among them, rosemary polyphenols have shown a vast antiproliferative capacity against colon cancer cells in vitro and in animal models. We have investigated the antitumor activity of a rosemary extract (RE) obtained by using supercritical fluid extraction through its capacity to inhibit various signatures of cancer progression and metastasis such as proliferation, migration, invasion and clonogenic survival. RE strongly inhibited proliferation, migration and colony formation of colon cancer cells regardless their phenotype. Treatment with RE led to a sharp increase of intracellular ROS that resulted in necrosis cell death. Nrf2 gene silencing increased RE cytotoxic effects, thus suggesting that this pathway was involved in cell survival. These in vitro results were in line with a reduction of tumor growth by oral administration of RE in a xenograft model of colon cancer cells using athymic nude mice. These findings indicate that targeting colon cancer cells by increasing intracellular ROS and decreasing cell survival mechanisms may suppose a therapeutic option in colon cancer through the combination of rosemary compounds and chemotherapeutic drugs. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Although cure rates are high for early stage disease, clinical outcomes for advanced, metastatic, or recurrent disease remain poor. To change this panorama, a deeper understanding of cervical cancer biology and novel study models are needed. Immortalized human cancer cell lines such as HeLa constitute crucial scientific tools, but there are few other cervical cancer cell lines available, limiting our understanding of a disease known for its molecular heterogeneity. This study aimed to establish novel cervical cancer cell lines derived from Brazilian patients. We successfully established one (HCB-514) out of 35 cervical tumors biopsied. We confirmed the phenotype of HCB-514 by verifying its’ epithelial and tumor origin through cytokeratins, EpCAM and p16 staining. It was also HPV-16 positive. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) showed relevant somatic mutations in several genes including BRCA2, TGFBR1 and IRX2. A copy number variation (CNV) analysis by nanostring and WES revealed amplification of genes mainly related to kinases proteins involved in proliferation, migration and cell differentiation, such as EGFR, PIK3CA, and MAPK7. Overexpression of EGFR was confirmed by phospho RTK-array and validated by western blot analysis. Furthermore, the HCB-514 cell line was sensitive to cisplatin. In summary, this novel Brazilian cervical cancer cell line exhibits relevant key molecular features and constitutes a new biological model for pre-clinical studies. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Oncogene-induced replication stress (RS) promotes cancer development but also impedes tumor growth by activating anti-cancer barriers. To determine how cancer cells adapt to RS, we have monitored the expression of different components of the ATR-CHK1 pathway in primary tumor samples. We show that unlike upstream components of the pathway, the checkpoint mediators Claspin and Timeless are overexpressed in a coordinated manner. Remarkably, reducing the levels of Claspin and Timeless in HCT116 cells to pretumoral levels impeded fork progression without affecting checkpoint signaling. These data indicate that high level of Claspin and Timeless increase RS tolerance by protecting replication forks in cancer cells. Moreover, we report that primary fibroblasts adapt to oncogene-induced RS by spontaneously overexpressing Claspin and Timeless, independently of ATR signaling. Altogether, these data indicate that enhanced levels of Claspin and Timeless represent a gain of function that protects cancer cells from of oncogene-induced RS in a checkpoint-independent manner. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Turmeric, since in ancient Indian traditional medicinal system, has been implicated for its therapeutic and chemopreventive properties against a broad spectrum of diseases. Curcumin, the active polyphenol from turmeric, helps to obstruct the growth of many types of cancers at various stages which include prostrate, melanoma, breast, brain tumor, pancreatic, leukemia, etc. The initiation and recurrence of cancer have been attributed to few mutated cells in bulk of tumor called as cancer stem cells which have the capacity of self-renewal and differentiation. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3B) is a multifunctional serine/threonine protein kinase, originally found in mammals, an important component of diverse signaling pathways, dysregulation of which leads to affect the cancer stem cell properties. The nutritional- and phytochemical-based dietary interventions may complement current chemotherapy to prevent recurrence and relapse of cancer. The objective of present study is to investigate the effect of retinoic acid and curcumin–retinoic acid conjugates against GSK-3B protein. The in silico results indicate that molecule 3 (curcumin–retinoic acid conjugates) might be a potent inhibitor of GSK-3B and a novel future drug candidate for the treatment of cancer. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature." ;

        fabio:abstract    "In this study, we aimed to identify mutations of key genes associated with docetaxel resistance in nine endometrial cancer cell lines. Endometrial cancers are associated with several critical gene mutations, including PIK3A, PTEN, and KRAS. Different gene mutations in endometrial cancer cells have varied responses to anticancer drugs and cancer therapies. The most frequently altered gene in endometrioid endometrial carcinoma tumors is PTEN. PTEN protein has lipid phosphatase and protein phosphatase activity, as well as other functions in the nucleus. Although the tumor-suppressive function of PTEN has mainly been attributed to its lipid phosphatase activity, a role for PTEN protein phosphatase activity in cell cycle regulation has also been suggested. Various tumor type-specific PTEN mutations are well documented. Here, nine endometrioid endometrial cancer cell lines with PIK3A, PTEN, and KRAS gene mutations were treated with docetaxel and radiation. One mutation with a docetaxel drug-resistant effect was a truncated form of PTEN. Among PTEN mutations in endometrial cancer cells, the Y68 frame shift mutation of PTEN constitutes a major mechanism of resistance to docetaxel treatment. The molecular mechanism involves truncation of the 403 amino acid PTEN protein at amino acid 68 by the Y68 frame shift, leading to the loss of PTEN protein phosphatase and lipid phosphatase activities. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Hence to mimic such complex biological processes, an understanding of stimuli responsiveness is needed to sense specific changes and respond in a predictable manner. Such responses due to polymers may take place either simultaneously at the site or in a sequential manner from preparation to transporting pathways to cellular compartments. The present review comprehends the stimuli-responsive polymers and multi-responsiveness with respect to cancer therapy. It focuses on the exploitation of different stimuli like temperature, pH and enzymes responsiveness in a multi-stimuli setting. Nanogels and micelles being two of the most commonly used responsive polymeric carriers have also been discussed. The role of multiple stimuli delivery system is significant due to multiple changes happening in the near surroundings of cancer cells. These responsive materials are able to mimic some biological processes and recognize at the molecular level itself to manipulate development of custom-designed molecules for targeting cancer cells." ;

In contrast, antibodies to BLV were found in a very small percentage of healthy blood donors. There was no association between BLV DNA and other tumor prognostic biological markers such as hormonal receptors, HER2 oncoprotein, proliferation index, metastasis in sentinels lymph nodes, and tumor grade and size. Our findings suggest that BLV should be considered a potential predisposing factor to breast cancer in women. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Here we report that ovarian cancer cells manifest a spectrum of tumorigenic phenotypes upon knockdown of PIK3R1. PIK3R1 loss activates AKT and p110-independent JAK2/STAT3 signaling through inducing changes in the phosphorylation of the docking protein Gab2, thereby relieving the negative inhibition on AKT and promoting the assembly of JAK2/STAT3 signalosome, respectively. Additional mechanisms leading to AKT activation include enhanced p110α kinase activity and a decrease in PTEN level. PIK3R1 loss renders ovarian cancer cells vulnerable to inhibition of AKT or JAK2/STAT3. The combination of AKT and STAT3 inhibitors significantly increases the anti-tumor effect compared to single-agent treatments.

Finally, analysis of 214 prostate and 35 breast cancer genomes reveal that late-replicating regions are prone to cis and early-replication to trans chromosomal rearrangements.

        fabio:abstract    "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are promising therapies for haematological cancers. Historically, their therapeutic benefit is due to ADC targeting of lineage-restricted antigens. The C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is attractive for targeted therapy of haematological cancers, given its expression in multiple tumour types and role in cancer “homing” to bone marrow. However, CXCR4 is also expressed in haematopoietic cells and other normal tissues, raising safety challenges to the development of anti-CXCR4 ADCs for cancer treatment. Here, we designed the first anti-CXCR4 ADC with favourable therapeutic index, effective in xenografts of haematopoietic cancers resistant to standard of care and anti-CXCR4 antibodies. We screened multiple ADC configurations, by varying type of linker-payload, drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR), affinity and Fc format. The optimal ADC bears a non-cleavable linker, auristatin as payload at DAR = 4 and a low affinity antibody with effector–reduced Fc. Contrary to other drugs targeting CXCR4, anti-CXCR4 ADCs effectively eliminated cancer cells as monotherapy, while minimizing leucocytosis. The optimal ADC selectively eliminated CXCR4 + cancer cells in solid tumours, but showed limited toxicity to normal CXCR4 + tissues, sparing haematopoietic stem cells and progenitors. Our work provides proof-of-concept that through empirical ADC design, it is possible to target proteins with broad normal tissue expression. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Cancers in the bone produce a number of severe symptoms including pain that compromises patient functional status, quality of life, and survival. The source of this pain is multifaceted and includes factors secreted from tumor cells. Malignant cells release the neurotransmitter and cell-signaling molecule glutamate via the oxidative stress-related cystine/glutamate antiporter, system x C − , which reciprocally imports cystine for synthesis of glutathione and the cystine/cysteine redox cycle. Pharmacological inhibition of system x C − has shown success in reducing and delaying the onset of cancer pain-related behavior in mouse models. This investigation describes the development of a stable siRNA-induced knockdown of the functional trans-membrane system x C − subunit xCT (SLC7A11) in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Clones were verified for xCT knockdown at the transcript, protein, and functional levels. RNAseq was performed on a representative clone to comprehensively examine the transcriptional cellular signature in response to xCT knockdown, identifying multiple differentially regulated factors relevant to cancer pain including nerve growth factor, interleukin-1, and colony-stimulating factor-1. Mice were inoculated intrafemorally and recordings of pain-related behaviors including weight bearing, mechanical withdrawal, and limb use were performed. Animals implanted with xCT knockdown cancer cells displayed a delay until the onset of nociceptive behaviors relative to control cells. These results add to the body of evidence suggesting that a reduction in glutamate release from cancers in bone by inhibition of the system x C − transporter may decrease the severe and intractable pain associated with bone metastases. © The Author(s) 2017." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Background: The global cancer incidence and the number of survivors are increasing. Therefore, it is necessary to pay more attention to the side effects of treatment. Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of reflexology on the side effects of chemotherapy in cancer patients. Method: For finding the related articles, the researchers searched several databases including PubMed &ProQuest and valid websites including ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Scientific Information Database, and Magiran. The key terms of \"reflexology, cancer, and chemotherapy\" individually and combined together were searched in Parisian and English, and the studies performed from 2009 to 2017 were extracted. Due to the lack of sufficient studies carried out into the outcome of reflexology on chemotherapy, both Persian and English articles were used. Results: A total of 57 studies were extracted from the databases and valid websites; five of which met the inclusion criteria. All selected studies were clinical trials. Implications for Practice: Reflexology can be used as a non-pharmacologic nursing intervention to alleviate the side effects of chemotherapy and improve the quality of life of cancer patients. © 2017 Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

        fabio:abstract    "CD47 is a prominent new target in cancer immunotherapy, with antagonistic antibodies currently being evaluated in clinical trials. For effective evaluation of this strategy it is crucial to identify which patients are suited for CD47-targeted therapy. In this respect, expression of the pro-phagocytic signal SLAMF7 on both macrophages and cancer cells was recently reported to be a requisite for CD47 antibody-mediated phagocytosis. Here, we demonstrate that in fact SLAMF7 expression on cancer cells is not required and does not impact on CD47 antibody therapy. Moreover, SLAMF7 also does not impact on phagocytosis induction by CD20 antibody rituximab nor associates with overall survival of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma patients. In contrast, expression of CD47 negatively impacts on overall and progression free survival. In conclusion, cancer cell expression of SLAMF7 is not required for phagocytosis and, in contrast to CD47 expression, should not be used as selection criterion for CD47-targeted therapy. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Increased Crabp2 levels have been found in various types of cancer, and are associated with poor patients’ survival. Although Crabp2 is found to be overexpressed in lung cancer, its role in metastasis of lung cancer is unclear. In this study, Crabp2 was overexpressed in high-metastatic C10F4 than low-metastatic lung cancer cells. Analysis of clinical samples revealed that high CRABP2 levels were correlated with lymph node metastases, poor overall survival, and increased recurrence. Knockdown of Crabp2 decreased migration, invasion, anoikis resistance, and in vivo metastasis. Crabp2 was co-immunoprecipitated with HuR, and overexpression of Crabp2 increased HuR levels, which promoted integrin β1/FAK/ERK signaling. Inhibition of HuR or integrin β1/FAK/ERK signaling reversed the promoting effect of Crabp2 in migration, invasion, and anoikis resistance. Knockdown of Crabp2 further inhibited the growth of cancer cells as compared with that by gemcitabine or irinotecan alone. The expression of Crabp2 in human lung tumors was correlated with stress marker CHOP. In conclusion, our findings have identified the promoting role of Crabp2 in anoikis resistance and metastasis. CRABP2 may serve as a prognostic marker and targeting CRABP2 may be exploited as a modality to reduce metastasis. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "SPG-56 is a newly isolated glycoprotein from sweet potatoes (Zhongshu NO. 1), but its value for suppressing breast cancer progression remains unknown. This study was designed to investigate the potential anti-cancer effects of SPG-56, which consists of 2.9% sugar and 97.1% protein. The effects of SPG-56 on the proliferation and apoptosis of breast cancer cells were determined using CCK-8 and Hoechst 33342 assays and flow cytometry, after staining with Annexin V and PI respectively. The activities of SPG-56 against breast cancer were examined using female BALB/c nude mice orthotopically implanted with human breast carcinoma cells of the types MCF-7 and 4T1-Luc. The cellular experiments showed that SPG-56 inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of MCF-7 cells dose- and time-dependently. Oral administration of SPG-56 significantly suppressed the development of MCF-7 tumor cells (P < 0.01) as compared with an untreated group. The serum tumor markers CEA, CA125 and CA153 in a 240 mg/kg/d SPG-56 decreased by 54.8%, 91.8%, and 90.3%, respectively. The experiments further demonstrated that SPG-56 inhibited the metastasis of breast cancer in MCF-7 and 4T1-bearing mice by altering the expression of MMP2, MMP9, VEGF, Occludin and Claudin. It is concluded that SPG-56 may have potential as a novel anti-tumor candidate for breast cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Lymph node metastasis is of major prognostic significance for breast cancer. Lymph node metastasis arises at a very early stage in some patients. Using the data downloaded from the TCGA database, we studied the differences between primary tumors with and without lymph node metastasis at the multi-omics level using bioinformatics approaches. Our study found that low mutation and neoantigen burdens correlated with lymph node metastazation of breast cancer. All three conserved domains in TP53 were mutated in lymph node-negative breast cancers, whereas only one domain was mutated in lymph node-positive samples. Mutations in microtubule-related proteins appear to help immune cells recognize tumors and inhibit their lymph node metastasis. Destroying microtubule-related proteins is a potential therapeutic strategy to inhibit lymph node metastasis of breast cancer. As the neoantigens specifically present in lymph node-positive breast cancers, MAPK10, BC9L, TRIM65, CD93, KITLG, CNPPD1, CPED1, CCDC146, TMEM185A, INO80D, and PSMD11 are potential targets for vaccine design. In the tumor microenvironment, reduced numbers of effector immune cells, especially activated memory CD4+ T cells and activated mast cells, facilitate breast cancer metastasis to the lymph nodes. According to transcriptome data, lymph node metastasis was mostly driven by gene mutation rather than by gene expression. Although differential gene expression analysis was based on lymph node metastasis status, many genes were shown to be differentially expressed based on estrogen receptor status. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Fibroblasts turn into cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumour microenvironment. CAFs have recently attracted attention for their function as a regulator of immune cell recruitment and function in addition to their tumour-promoting roles. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of CAFs on monocyte recruitment and macrophage polarization in breast cancer. CAFs, which were α-SMA expressing fibroblasts in contrast to normal fibroblasts (NFs), effectively recruited monocytes. Recruitment of monocytes by CAFs might be mediated by monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) as well as stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) cytokines. CAFs differentiated the recruited monocytes into M2-like macrophages which are capable of exerting their immunosuppressive roles via the PD-1 axis. CAF-educated monocytes exhibited strong immune suppression unlike NF-educated monocytes and enhanced the motility/invasion of breast cancer cells in addition to increasing the expressions of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes and vimentin protein in cancer cells. CAF-educated M1 macrophages displayed increased expression of M2 markers and production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in contrast to decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12 compared with control M1 macrophages; suggesting that CAFs were also able to induce the trans-differentiation of M1 macrophages to M2 macrophages. We then investigated the relationship between the infiltration of CAFs and tumour associated macrophages (TAMs) using tissue samples obtained from breast cancer patients. High grade of CAFs significantly correlated with the number of TAMs in human breast cancer tissue samples. It was also associated with higher Ki-67 proliferation index, and higher tumour volume. This result is in line with our finding of increased breast cancer cell proliferation due to the effects of CAF-educated monocytes in vitro. Our results concluded that CAFs play pivotal roles in sculpturing the tumour microenvironment in breast cancer, and therapeutic strategies to reverse the CAF-mediated immunosuppressive microenvironment should be taken into consideration. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

We construct iCells of four cancers and the corresponding tissue controls and identify the most rewired genes in cancer.

We biologically validate that they have a role in cancer by knockdown experiments followed by cell viability assays.

We benchmarked Uniquorn 2 by cross-identifying 1612 RNA and 3596 panel-sized NGS profiles derived from 1516 CCLs, five repositories, four technologies and three major cancer panel-designs. Our method achieves an accuracy of 96% for RNA-seq and 95% for mixed DNA-seq and RNA-seq identification. Even for a panel of only 94 cancer-related genes, accuracy remains at 82% but decreases when using smaller panels.

The angular spectra of scattering coefficient maps of normal tissues exhibit a spatial feature distinct from those of abnormal tissues. An angular spectrum index to quantify the differences between the normal and abnormal tissues is derived, and its strength in revealing subsurface cancer in ex vivo samples is statistically analyzed.

        fabio:abstract    "Metastatic colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer death. Current options in palliation such as hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) present severe side effects. Recent research efforts suggested the therapeutic use of oxidant-enriched liquid using cold physical plasma. To investigate a clinically accepted treatment regimen, we assessed the antitumor capacity of plasma-treated saline solution. In response to such liquid, CT26 murine colon cancer cells were readily oxidized and showed cell growth with subsequent apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and upregulation of immunogenic cell death (ICD) markers in vitro. This was accompanied by marked morphological changes with re-arrangement of actin fibers and reduced motility. Induction of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype was not observed. Key results were confirmed in MC38 colon and PDA6606 pancreatic cancer cells. Compared to plasma-treated saline, hydrogen peroxide was inferiorly toxic in 3D tumor spheroids but of similar efficacy in 2D models. In vivo, plasma-treated saline decreased tumor burden in Balb/C mice. This was concomitant with elevated numbers of intratumoral macrophages and increased T cell activation following incubation with CT26 cells ex vivo. Being a potential adjuvant for HIPEC therapy, our results suggest oxidizing saline solutions to inactivate colon cancer cells while potentially stimulating antitumor immune responses. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Although solid fuel combustion emissions are known to increase the prevalence of illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer, however, their effect on the eyes is underexplored. This study assesses the acute toxicity of solid fuel combustion emissions on healthy ocular cells and a cancer cell line. Three healthy ocular cell lines (corneal, lens, and retinal epithelial cells) and a cancer cell line (Chinese hamster ovary cells) were exposed to liquid and gas phase emissions from applewood and coal combustion. Following the exposure, real-time cell attachment behavior was monitored for at least 120 hours with electrical cell impedance spectroscopy. The viability of the cells, amount of apoptotic cells, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were quantified with MTT, ApoTox-Glo, and ROS-Glo H 2 O 2 assays, respectively. The results showed that coal emissions compromised the viability of ocular cells more than applewood emissions. Interestingly, the cancer cells, although their viability was not compromised, generated 1.7 to 2.7 times more ROS than healthy cells. This acute exposure study provides compelling proof that biomass combustion emissions compromise the viability of ocular cells and increase ROS generation. The increased ROS generation was fatal for ocular cells, but it promoted the growth of cancer cells. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) include endogenous metabolites that provide information about health and disease which might be useful to develop a better screening method for breast cancer. The goal of this study was to classify mice with and without tumors and compare tumors localized to the mammary pad and tumor cells injected into the iliac artery by differences in VOCs in urine. After 4T1.2 tumor cells were injected into BALB/c mice either in the mammary pad or into the iliac artery, urine was collected, VOCs from urine headspace were concentrated by solid phase microextraction and results were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry quadrupole time-of-flight. Multivariate and univariate statistical analyses were employed to find potential biomarkers for breast cancer and metastatic breast cancer in mice models. A set of six VOCs classified mice with and without tumors with an area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC AUC) of 0.98 (95% confidence interval [0.85, 1.00]) via five-fold cross validation. Classification of mice with tumors in the mammary pad and iliac artery was executed utilizing a different set of six VOCs, with a ROC AUC of 0.96 (95% confidence interval [0.75, 1.00]). © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

In an additional two metastatic colon cancer patients, we detected CD8 + neoantigen-specific cells targeting the mutated SMAD5 and MUC4 proteins.

Moreover, the high drug loading capacity of Cet-SLN was employed to encapsulate photothermal agent indocyanine green (ICG) to finally fabricate a versatile drug delivery system (DDS) able to co-deliver Cet and ICG (Cet-SLN/ICG) for combinational chemo-photothermal therapy of breast cancer. The obtained results clearly demonstrated that Cet-SLN/ICG was well-dispersed nanoparticles with preferable stability under physiological condition. Furthermore, due to the conjugation of Cet, Cet-SLN/ICG could target EGFR which overexpress in MCF-7 cells. Most importantly, both in vitro and in vivo results suggested that compared with Cet or ICG alone, the Cet-SLN/ICG showed superior anticancer efficacy. In conclusion, Cet-SLN/ICG could be a potential platform for effective combinational chemo-photothermal therapy for breast cancer." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The integration of genomic and DNA methylation data has been demonstrated as a powerful strategy in understanding cancer mechanisms and identifying therapeutic targets. The TCGA consortium has mapped DNA methylation in thousands of cancer samples using Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 K BeadChip (Illumina 450 K array) that only covers about 1.5% of CpGs in the human genome. Therefore, increasing the coverage of the DNA methylome would significantly leverage the usage of the TCGA data. Here, we present a new model called EAGLING that can expand the Illumina 450 K array data 18 times to cover about 30% of the CpGs in the human genome. We applied it to analyze 13 cancers in TCGA. By integrating the expanded methylation, gene expression, and somatic mutation data, we identified the genes showing differential patterns in each of the 13 cancers. Many of the triple-evidenced genes identified in majority of the cancers are biomarkers or potential biomarkers. Pan-cancer analysis also revealed the pathways in which the triple-evidenced genes are enriched, which include well known ones as well as new ones, such as axonal guidance signaling pathway and pathways related to inflammatory processing or inflammation response. Triple-evidenced genes, particularly TNXB, RRM2, CELSR3, SLC16A3, FANCI, MMP9, MMP11, SIK1, and TRIM59 showed superior predictive power in both tumor diagnosis and prognosis. These results have demonstrated that the integrative analysis using the expanded methylation data is powerful in identifying critical genes/pathways that may serve as new therapeutic targets. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

However, macrophages make up a majority of immune cell infiltrates into tumors, creating natural targets for immunotherapies able to direct macrophages away from tumor-supportive functions and toward anti-tumor phenotypes. Recent studies demonstrate that toll-like receptors (TLRs) – pathways that quickly trigger early immune responses – play an important role in polarizing macrophages. Here, we present emerging ways in which TLR signaling is being manipulated in macrophages to create new opportunities for cancer immunotherapy. In particular, we discuss approaches to deliver TLR agonists, to leverage biomaterials in these therapies, and to couple TLR-based approaches with other frontline treatments as combination cancer therapies. © 2017" ;

We analyzed the immune profiles, T cell cytotoxicity, and TCR repertoire of peripheral blood, normal lung tissue, and tumor tissue from NSCLC patients. By using bispecific T-cell engager technology to assess the cytotoxicity of T cells, we found that the cytotoxicity of tumor-infiltrated T cells closely correlated with that of peripheral T cells. This correlation was supported by the immune profiles, cytokine production, and results of the TCR repertoire analysis from these specimens. We also found that the cytotoxicity of peripheral T cells has potential as a predictor of the effects of nivolumab in the tumor microenvironment.

This standard procedure relies on the slow radioactivity loss, usually attributed to the limited tumour expression of G6P-phosphatase (G6Pase). However, this classical interpretation intrinsically represents an approximation since, as in all tissues, cancer G6Pase activity is remarkable and is confined to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whose lumen must be reached by phosphorylated FDG to explain its hydrolysis and radioactivity release. The present study tested the impact of G6Pase sequestration on the mathematical description of FDG trafficking and handling in cultured cancer cells. Our data show that accounting for tracer access to the ER configures this compartment as the preferential site of FDG accumulation. This is confirmed by the reticular localization of fluorescent FDG analogues. Remarkably enough, reticular accumulation rate of FDG is dependent upon extracellular glucose availability, thus configuring the same ER as a significant determinant of cancer glucose metabolism. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Although current methods of treatment for cervical cancer can ablate lesions, preventing metastatic disseminations and excessive tissue injuries still remains a major concern. Hence, development of a safer and more efficient treatment modality is of vital importance. Natural products from plants are one of the principal sources of precursors to lead compounds with direct pharmaceutical application across all disease classes. One of these plants is Ficus carica, whose fruit latex, when applied on HPV-induced skin warts, has shown potential as a possible cure for this virus related lesions. This study explores the in vitro biological activities of fig latex and elucidates its possible mechanisms of action on cervical cancer cell lines CaSki and HeLa positive for HPV type 16 and 18, respectively. Our data shows that fig latex inhibits properties that are associated with HPV-positive cervical cancer transformed cells such as rapid growth and invasion and substantially downregulated the expression of p16 and HPV onco-proteins E6, E7. These findings suggest Ficus carica latex has the potential to be used in the development of therapeutic modalities for the possible treatment, cure and prevention of HPV related cervical cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing methods, the diversity and composition of the microbiota from ovarian cancer tissues (25 samples) and normal distal fallopian tube tissues (25 samples) were analyzed. High-throughput sequencing showed that the diversity and richness indexes were significantly decreased in ovarian cancer tissues compared to tissues from normal distal fallopian tubes. The ratio of the two phyla for Proteobacteria/Firmicutes was notably increased in ovarian cancer, which revealed that microbial composition change might be associated with the process of ovarian cancer development. In addition, transcriptome-sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses suggested that the transcriptional profiles were statistically different between ovarian carcinoma and normal distal fallopian tubes. Moreover, a set of genes including 84 different inflammation-associated or immune-associated genes, which had been named as the human antibacterial-response genes were also modulated expression.

        fabio:abstract    "Several pioneering work have established that apart from genetic alterations, epigenetic modifications contribute significantly in tumor progression. Remarkable role of EZH2 in cancer highlights the importance of identifying its targets. Although much emphasis has been placed in recent years in designing drugs and inhibitors targeting EZH2, less effort has been given in exploring its existing targets that will help in understanding the oncogenic role of EZH2 in turn which may provide a more stringent method of targeting EZH2. In the present study, we validated six direct targets of EZH2 that are GPNMB, PMEPA1, CoL5A1, VGLL4, POMT2 and SUMF1 associated with cancer related pathways. Upon EZH2 knockdown, more than two fold increase in the target gene expression was evident. CHIP-qPCR performed in both MCF-7 and MDA-MDA-231 confirmed the in-vivo binding of EZH2 on its identified target. Thirty invasive breast carcinoma cases with their adjacent normal tissues were included in the study. Immunohistochemistry in primary breast tumor tissue array showed tumor dependent expression of EZH2. Array of MERAV expression database revealed the strength of association of EZH2 with its target genes. Real time PCR performed with RNA extracted from breast tumor tissues further authenticated the existing negative correlation between EZH2 and its target genes. Pearson correlation coefficient & statistical significance computed using the matrix provided in the database strengthened the negative correlation between identified target genes and EZH2. KM plotter analysis showed improved relapse-free survival with increased expression of PMEPA1, POMT2, VGLL4 and SUMF1 in breast cancer patients indicating their therapeutic potential. While investigating the relevance of these target genes, different mutations of them were found in breast cancer patients. Seeking the clinical relevance of our study, following our recent publication that reports the role of EZH2 in nicotine-mediated breast cancer development and progression, we observed significant reduced expression of SUMF1 in breast cancer patient samples with smoking history in comparison to never-smoked patient samples. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we report that TOP1MT is overexpressed in cancer tissues and demonstrate that TOP1MT deficiency attenuates tumor growth in human and mouse models of colon and liver cancer. Due to their mitochondrial dysfunction, TOP1MT-KO cells become addicted to glycolysis, which limits synthetic building blocks and energy supply required for the proliferation of cancer cells in a nutrient-deprived tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, we show that TOP1MT associates with mitoribosomal subunits, ensuring optimal mitochondrial translation and assembly of oxidative phosphorylation complexes that are critical for sustaining tumor growth. The TOP1MT genomic signature profile, based on Top1mt-KO liver cancers, is correlated with enhanced survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Our results highlight the importance of TOP1MT for tumor development, providing a potential rationale to develop TOP1MT-targeted drugs as anticancer therapies. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

A new data integrative approach, based on graphical models, was applied on our multi-modal –omics, and clinical data cohort of metastatic melanoma patients. We found that response to chemotherapy is directly linked to ten gene expression, four methylation variables and PARP1 SNP rs1805407. PARP1 is a DNA repair gene critical for chemotherapy response and for which FDA-approved inhibitors are clinically available (olaparib). We demonstrated that two PARP inhibitors (ABT-888 and olaparib) make SNP carrier cancer cells of various histologic subtypes more sensitive to alkylating agents, but they have no effect in wild-type cells. Furthermore, PARP1 inhibitors act synergistically with chemotherapy in SNP carrier cells (especially in ovarian cancer for which olaparib is FDA-approved), but they are additive at best in wild-type cancer cells. Taken together, our results suggest that the combination of chemotherapy and PARP1 inhibition may benefit the carriers of rs1805407 in the future and may be used in personalized therapy strategies to select patients that are more likely to respond to PARP inhibitors. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Cancer remains one of the biggest threats to human society. There are massive demands for compounds to selectively kill cancerous cells. Earlier studies have shown that bovine α -lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells (BAMLET) becomes cytotoxic against cancer cells in complex with oleic acid {Hoque, M. et. al., PLoSOne8, e68390 (2013)}. In our study, we obtained bovine α-lactalbumin complexed with lanthanum ion (La 3+ -B-α-LA) and determined its high resolution crystal structure. The natural calcium binding site of bovine α-lactalbumin is replaced by lanthanum. The La 3+ complex formation by B-α-apo-LA was also supported by various biophysical methods. Interestingly, our complex, La 3+ -B-α-LA exhibits much greater anticancer activity against breast cancer cells as compared to the reported BAMLET-oleic acid complex. This study shows that La 3+ -B-α-LA complex is preferentially more toxic to MCF-7 cells as compared to KB (oral cancer) and HeLa (cervical) cells, while almost non-toxic to the healthy cells that we studied. Our data indicates that the cytotoxicity of La 3+ -B-α-LA against cancer cells is through apoptotic path way. The higher anticancer activity of La 3+ -B-α-LA is attributable to the requisite structural changes induced in the protein by La 3+ binding as supported by the crystal structure of the complex. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

However, no studies have evaluated vascular pain in patients with colorectal cancer in relation to peripheral venous administration of chemotherapy with or without oxaliplatin. We evaluated oxaliplatin-induced vascular pain using subjective and objective methods. We determined if oxaliplatin induced vascular pain in patients with colorectal cancer using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and a PainVision PS-2100 device. We compared VAS score between chemotherapy regimens with or without oxaliplatin, and between genders. We also examined the correlations of VAS score with pain intensity examined by the PainVision PS-2100, and with age and vessel diameter. A total of 98 patients with colorectal cancer were enrolled in this study, including 78 patients who received oxaliplatin via peripheral venous administration and 20 who received chemotherapy without oxaliplatin. The median VAS scores in patients with and without oxaliplatin were 36.5 (interquartile range 9.0–60.0) and 0 (0–4.0), respectively (P < 0.001), and the median pain intensities according to PainVision were 43.5 (14.3–98) and 36.5 (9.3–58.5), respectively (P < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between VAS and pain intensity (r = 0.584), but no correlation between VAS score and age (r = −0.174) or vessel diameter (r = −0.107).

One of the emerging techniques with tremendous power for lung cancer therapy is magnetic aerosol drug targeting (MADT). The use of a permanent magnet for effective drug delivery in a desired location throughout the lung requires extensive optimization, but it has not been addressed yet. In the present study, the possibility of using a permanent magnet for trapping the particles on a lung tumor is evaluated numerically in the Weibel's model from G0 to G3. The effect of different parameters is considered on the efficiency of particle deposition in a tumor located on a distant position of the lung bronchi and bronchioles. Also, the effective position of the magnetic source, tumor size, and location are the objectives for particle deposition. The results show that a limited particle deposition occurs on the lung branches in passive targeting. However, the incorporation of a permanent magnet next to the tumor enhanced the particle deposition fraction on G2 to up to 49% for the particles of 7 µm diameter. Optimizing the magnet size could also improve the particle deposition fraction by 68%. It was also shown that the utilization of MADT is essential for effective drug delivery to the tumors located on the lower wall of airway branches given the dominance of the air velocity and resultant drag force in this region. The results demonstrated the high competence and necessity of MADT as a noninvasive drug delivery method for lung cancer therapy." ;

Adjuvant chemotherapy has significantly reduced mortality but increased cognitive impairments, including attention function, making quality of life issues a crucial concern. This study enrolled nineteen breast cancer patients who were treated with standard chemotherapy within 6 months and 20 sex-matched healthy controls to investigate the brain effects of chemotherapy. All participants underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) with mean fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (mfALFF) analysis and were correlated with neuropsychological tests, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised (CAMS-R), and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), to explore the possible underlying mechanism of cognitive alternations. We found increased mfALFF over the frontoparietal lobe and decreased mfALFF over the occipital lobe in the cancer patients compared with the healthy controls; the altered brain regions may be associated with the dorsal attention network (DAN) and may be explained by a compensatory mechanism. Both MMSE and CAMS-R scores showed a positive correlation with mfALFF in the occipital lobe but a negative correlation in the frontoparietal lobe. By contrast, IES-R scores showed a positive correlation with mfALFF in the frontoparietal lobe but a negative correlation in the occipital lobe. These alterations are potentially related to the effects of both chemotherapy and psychological distress.

Mutations that occur in certain splicing factor genes themselves have been implicated in many cancers, particularly myelodysplastic syndromes. Small molecules that target splicing factors have been developed as therapies to preferentially induce apoptosis in these cancer cells.

There have been many attempts to identify markers and key pathways induced throughout EMT but the process is complex and depends on the cancer type and tumour microenvironment. Here we used the colon cancer cell line HT29, which stably overexpressed Snail, the key transcription factor in early EMT, as a model for colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with a pro-metastatic phenotype. We investigated miRNA expression regulation during that phenotypic switching. We found that overexpression of Snail in HT29 cells triggered significant changes in individual miRNA levels but did not change the global efficiency of miRNA processing. Snail abundance repressed the expression of miR-192 and miR-194 and increased miR-205, let-7i and SNORD13 levels. These identified changes correlated with the reported transcriptomic alterations in Snail-overexpressing HT29 cells. We also investigated how Snail affected the miRNA content of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from HT29 cells.

        fabio:abstract    "Solid malignancies are associated with the development of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP). This study aimed to evaluate the risk factors for PJP among patients with lung cancer. This retrospective case-control study compared patients who had lung cancer with PJP (n = 112) or without PJP (n = 336) matched according to age, sex, histopathology, and stage. PJP definition was based on (i) positive PCR or direct immunofluorescence results for pneumocystis, (ii) clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities that were consistent with a pneumonic process, and (iii) received targeted PJP treatment. The development of PJP was associated with radiotherapy (RTx), concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRTx), lymphopenia, and prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (20 mg of prednisolone equivalent per day for ≥3 weeks). Multivariate analysis revealed independent associations with prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06–3.63; p = 0.032) and CCRTx (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.27–3.43; p = 0.004). Steroid use was frequently related to RTx pneumonitis or esophagitis (29 patients, 43.3%). Prolonged high-dose steroid therapy and CCRTx were risk factors for PJP development among patients with lung cancer. As these patients had a poor prognosis, clinicians should consider PJP prophylaxis for high-risk patients with lung cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we compared The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) breast cancer genomic datasets (array and next generation sequencing (NGS) data) in detecting genomic alterations in clinically relevant genes. We performed an in silico analysis to determine the concordance in the frequencies of actionable mutations and copy number alterations/aberrations (CNAs) in the two most common breast cancer histologies, invasive lobular and invasive ductal carcinoma. We found that targeted sequencing identified a larger number of mutational hotspots and clinically significant amplifications that would have been missed by WES and SNP arrays in many actionable genes such as PIK3CA, EGFR, AKT3, FGFR1, ERBB2, ERBB3 and ESR1. The striking differences between the number of mutational hotspots and CNAs generated from these platforms highlight a number of factors that should be considered in the interpretation of array and NGS-based genomic data for precision medicine. Targeted panel sequencing was preferable to WES to define the full spectrum of somatic mutations present in a tumor. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Several oxaliplatin transporters were previously identified but their relative contributions to determining oxaliplatin tumour responses and gastrointestinal tumour cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin remains unclear. We studied clinical associations between tumour expression of oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes and patient response to oxaliplatin, then experimentally verified associations found with MRP2 in models of human gastrointestinal cancer. Among 18 oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes, MRP2 was the only one to be differentially expressed in the tumours of colorectal cancer patients who did or did not respond to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Over-expression of MRP2 (endogenously in HepG2 and PANC-1 cells, or induced by stable transfection of HEK293 cells) decreased oxaliplatin accumulation and cytotoxicity but those deficits were reversed by inhibition of MRP2 with myricetin or siRNA knockdown. Mice bearing subcutaneous HepG2 tumour xenografts were sensitised to oxaliplatin antitumour activity by concurrent myricetin treatment with little or no increase in toxicity. In conclusion, MRP2 limits oxaliplatin accumulation and response in human gastrointestinal cancer. Screening tumour MRP2 expression levels, to select patients for treatment with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy alone or in combination with a MRP2 inhibitor, could improve treatment outcomes. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

We compare optimized gene signatures for cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin responses in the same cell lines and validate each signature using data from patients with cancer. Supervised support vector machine learning is used to derive gene sets whose expression is related to the cell line GI50 values by backwards feature selection with cross-validation. Specific genes and functional pathways distinguishing sensitive from resistant cell lines are identified by contrasting signatures obtained at extreme and median GI50 thresholds. Ensembles of gene signatures at different thresholds are combined to reduce the dependence on specific GI50 values for predicting drug responses. The most accurate gene signatures for each platin are: cisplatin: BARD1, BCL2, BCL2L1, CDKN2C, FAAP24, FEN1, MAP3K1, MAPK13, MAPK3, NFKB1, NFKB2, SLC22A5, SLC31A2, TLR4, and TWIST1; carboplatin: AKT1, EIF3K, ERCC1, GNGT1, GSR, MTHFR, NEDD4L, NLRP1, NRAS, RAF1, SGK1, TIGD1, TP53, VEGFB, and VEGFC; and oxaliplatin: BRAF, FCGR2A, IGF1, MSH2, NAGK, NFE2L2, NQO1, PANK3, SLC47A1, SLCO1B1, and UGT1A1. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with bladder, ovarian, and colorectal cancer were used to test the cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin signatures, resulting in 71.0%, 60.2%, and 54.5% accuracies in predicting disease recurrence and 59%, 61%, and 72% accuracies in predicting remission, respectively. One cisplatin signature predicted 100% of recurrence in non-smoking patients with bladder cancer (57% disease-free; N = 19), and 79% recurrence in smokers (62% disease-free; N = 35).

MTH1 dephosphorylates oxidized nucleotides, thereby preventing their incorporation into DNA and protecting tumour cells from oxidative DNA damage. Inhibitors of MTH1 (TH588 and (S)-crizotinib) were shown to reduce cancer cell viability. However, the MTH1-dependency of the anti-cancer effects of these drugs has recently been questioned. Here, we have assessed anti-tumour effects of TH588 and (S)-crizotinib in patient-derived 3D colorectal cancer cultures. Hypoxia and reoxygenation – conditions that increase intracellular ROS levels – increased sensitivity to (S)-crizotinib, but not to TH588. (S)-crizotinib reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-MET and ErbB3 whereas TH588 induced a mitotic cell cycle arrest, which was not affected by adding ROS-modulating compounds. Furthermore, we show that both compounds induced DNA damage that could not be prevented by adding the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Moreover, adding ROS-modulating compounds did not alter the reduction in viability in response to TH588 and (S)-crizotinib. We conclude that TH588 and (S)-crizotinib have very clear and distinct anti-tumour effects in 3D colorectal cancer cultures, but that these effects most likely occur through distinct and ROS-independent mechanisms. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Histological iron imaging and contrast-agent free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect these deposits, but their presence in human cancer, and correlation with immunotherapeutic response is largely untested. Here, primarily using these iron imaging approaches, we evaluated the spatial distribution of polarized macrophage populations containing high endogenous levels of iron in preclinical murine models and human breast cancer, and used them as metabolic biomarkers to correlate TAM infiltration with response to immunotherapy in preclinical trials. Macrophage-targeted inhibition of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) by immunotherapy was confirmed to inhibit macrophage accumulation and slow mammary tumor growth in mouse models while also reducing hemosiderin iron-laden TAM accumulation as measured by both iron histology and in vivo iron MRI (FeMRI). Spatial profiling of TAM iron deposit infiltration defined regions of maximal accumulation and response to the CSF1R inhibitor, and revealed differences between microenvironments of human cancer according to levels of polarized macrophage iron accumulation in stromal margins. We therefore demonstrate that iron deposition serves as an endogenous metabolic imaging biomarker of TAM infiltration in breast cancer that has high translational potential for evaluation of immunotherapeutic response. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

The AP2 family also acts as a tumor suppressor. Here we found that p73 and AP2 are able to activate NEU4, a neuraminidase gene, which removes the terminal sialic acid residues from cancer-associated glycans. Under serum starvation, NEU4 was up-regulated and one of the NEU4 target glycans, sialyl Lewis X, was decreased, whereas p73 and AP2 were up-regulated. Sialyl Lewis X levels were not, however, decreased under starvation conditions in p73- or AP2-knockdown cells. p53 and AP2 underwent protein-protein interactions, exerting synergistic effects to activate p21, and interaction of p53 with AP2 was lost in cells expressing the L350P mutation of p53. The homologous residues in p63 and p73 are L423 and L377, respectively. The synergistic effect of p53/p63 with AP2 to activate genes was lost with the L350P/L423P mutation in p53/p63, but p73 bearing the L377P mutation was able to interact with AP2 and exerted its normal synergistic effects. We propose that p73 and AP2 synergistically activate the NEU4 promoter in colon cancer cells. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Treatment with increasing concentrations of HspNPs (25, 50, 75 and 100 µg/mL) resulted in 9.1-, 7-, 12.5- and 12.7-fold in increase in apoptotic cell number. Optimum doses of Hsp and HspNPs were found to increase oxidative damage in C6 glioma cells. MDA levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were found to be significantly elevated at 75 and 100 µg/mL exposure concentration of HspNPs with (p = .002) and (p = .018), respectively for 48-h treatment.

GO exhibits pH-dependent fluorescence emission in the visible/near-infrared, providing a possibility of molecular imaging and pH-sensing. It is also water soluble and has a substantial platform for functionalization, allowing for the delivery of multiple therapeutics. GO physical properties are modified to enhance cellular internalization, producing fluorescent nanoflakes with low (<15%) cytotoxicity at the imaging concentrations of 15 μg/mL. As a result, at lower flake sizes GO rapidly internalizes into HeLa cells with the following 70% fluorescence based clearance at 24 h, assessed by its characteristic emission in red/near-IR. pH-dependence of GO emission is utilized to provide the sensing of acidic extracellular environments of cancer cells. The results demonstrate diminishing green/red (550/630 nm) fluorescence intensity ratios for HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells in comparison to HEK-293 healthy cells suggesting a potential use of GO as a non-invasive optical sensor for cancer microenvironments.

        fabio:abstract    "Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells, represents early stages of metastasis and is a promising target in colorectal cancer (CRC) therapy. There have been many attempts to identify markers and key pathways induced throughout EMT but the process is complex and depends on the cancer type and tumour microenvironment. Here we used the colon cancer cell line HT29, which stably overexpressed Snail, the key transcription factor in early EMT, as a model for colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with a pro-metastatic phenotype. We investigated miRNA expression regulation during that phenotypic switching. We found that overexpression of Snail in HT29 cells triggered significant changes in individual miRNA levels but did not change the global efficiency of miRNA processing. Snail abundance repressed the expression of miR-192 and miR-194 and increased miR-205, let-7i and SNORD13 levels. These identified changes correlated with the reported transcriptomic alterations in Snail-overexpressing HT29 cells. We also investigated how Snail affected the miRNA content of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from HT29 cells. Our data suggest that the presence of Snail significantly alters the complex mRNA/miRNA interactions in the early steps of metastasis and also has an impact on the content of EVs released from HT29 cells. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Solid malignancies are associated with the development of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP). This study aimed to evaluate the risk factors for PJP among patients with lung cancer. This retrospective case-control study compared patients who had lung cancer with PJP (n = 112) or without PJP (n = 336) matched according to age, sex, histopathology, and stage. PJP definition was based on (i) positive PCR or direct immunofluorescence results for pneumocystis, (ii) clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities that were consistent with a pneumonic process, and (iii) received targeted PJP treatment. The development of PJP was associated with radiotherapy (RTx), concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRTx), lymphopenia, and prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (20 mg of prednisolone equivalent per day for ≥3 weeks). Multivariate analysis revealed independent associations with prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06–3.63; p = 0.032) and CCRTx (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.27–3.43; p = 0.004). Steroid use was frequently related to RTx pneumonitis or esophagitis (29 patients, 43.3%). Prolonged high-dose steroid therapy and CCRTx were risk factors for PJP development among patients with lung cancer. As these patients had a poor prognosis, clinicians should consider PJP prophylaxis for high-risk patients with lung cancer. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Here, we compared The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) breast cancer genomic datasets (array and next generation sequencing (NGS) data) in detecting genomic alterations in clinically relevant genes. We performed an in silico analysis to determine the concordance in the frequencies of actionable mutations and copy number alterations/aberrations (CNAs) in the two most common breast cancer histologies, invasive lobular and invasive ductal carcinoma. We found that targeted sequencing identified a larger number of mutational hotspots and clinically significant amplifications that would have been missed by WES and SNP arrays in many actionable genes such as PIK3CA, EGFR, AKT3, FGFR1, ERBB2, ERBB3 and ESR1. The striking differences between the number of mutational hotspots and CNAs generated from these platforms highlight a number of factors that should be considered in the interpretation of array and NGS-based genomic data for precision medicine. Targeted panel sequencing was preferable to WES to define the full spectrum of somatic mutations present in a tumor. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Several oxaliplatin transporters were previously identified but their relative contributions to determining oxaliplatin tumour responses and gastrointestinal tumour cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin remains unclear. We studied clinical associations between tumour expression of oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes and patient response to oxaliplatin, then experimentally verified associations found with MRP2 in models of human gastrointestinal cancer. Among 18 oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes, MRP2 was the only one to be differentially expressed in the tumours of colorectal cancer patients who did or did not respond to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Over-expression of MRP2 (endogenously in HepG2 and PANC-1 cells, or induced by stable transfection of HEK293 cells) decreased oxaliplatin accumulation and cytotoxicity but those deficits were reversed by inhibition of MRP2 with myricetin or siRNA knockdown. Mice bearing subcutaneous HepG2 tumour xenografts were sensitised to oxaliplatin antitumour activity by concurrent myricetin treatment with little or no increase in toxicity. In conclusion, MRP2 limits oxaliplatin accumulation and response in human gastrointestinal cancer. Screening tumour MRP2 expression levels, to select patients for treatment with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy alone or in combination with a MRP2 inhibitor, could improve treatment outcomes. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

We compare optimized gene signatures for cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin responses in the same cell lines and validate each signature using data from patients with cancer. Supervised support vector machine learning is used to derive gene sets whose expression is related to the cell line GI50 values by backwards feature selection with cross-validation. Specific genes and functional pathways distinguishing sensitive from resistant cell lines are identified by contrasting signatures obtained at extreme and median GI50 thresholds. Ensembles of gene signatures at different thresholds are combined to reduce the dependence on specific GI50 values for predicting drug responses. The most accurate gene signatures for each platin are: cisplatin: BARD1, BCL2, BCL2L1, CDKN2C, FAAP24, FEN1, MAP3K1, MAPK13, MAPK3, NFKB1, NFKB2, SLC22A5, SLC31A2, TLR4, and TWIST1; carboplatin: AKT1, EIF3K, ERCC1, GNGT1, GSR, MTHFR, NEDD4L, NLRP1, NRAS, RAF1, SGK1, TIGD1, TP53, VEGFB, and VEGFC; and oxaliplatin: BRAF, FCGR2A, IGF1, MSH2, NAGK, NFE2L2, NQO1, PANK3, SLC47A1, SLCO1B1, and UGT1A1. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with bladder, ovarian, and colorectal cancer were used to test the cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin signatures, resulting in 71.0%, 60.2%, and 54.5% accuracies in predicting disease recurrence and 59%, 61%, and 72% accuracies in predicting remission, respectively. One cisplatin signature predicted 100% of recurrence in non-smoking patients with bladder cancer (57% disease-free; N = 19), and 79% recurrence in smokers (62% disease-free; N = 35).

MTH1 dephosphorylates oxidized nucleotides, thereby preventing their incorporation into DNA and protecting tumour cells from oxidative DNA damage. Inhibitors of MTH1 (TH588 and (S)-crizotinib) were shown to reduce cancer cell viability. However, the MTH1-dependency of the anti-cancer effects of these drugs has recently been questioned. Here, we have assessed anti-tumour effects of TH588 and (S)-crizotinib in patient-derived 3D colorectal cancer cultures. Hypoxia and reoxygenation – conditions that increase intracellular ROS levels – increased sensitivity to (S)-crizotinib, but not to TH588. (S)-crizotinib reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-MET and ErbB3 whereas TH588 induced a mitotic cell cycle arrest, which was not affected by adding ROS-modulating compounds. Furthermore, we show that both compounds induced DNA damage that could not be prevented by adding the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Moreover, adding ROS-modulating compounds did not alter the reduction in viability in response to TH588 and (S)-crizotinib. We conclude that TH588 and (S)-crizotinib have very clear and distinct anti-tumour effects in 3D colorectal cancer cultures, but that these effects most likely occur through distinct and ROS-independent mechanisms. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Histological iron imaging and contrast-agent free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect these deposits, but their presence in human cancer, and correlation with immunotherapeutic response is largely untested. Here, primarily using these iron imaging approaches, we evaluated the spatial distribution of polarized macrophage populations containing high endogenous levels of iron in preclinical murine models and human breast cancer, and used them as metabolic biomarkers to correlate TAM infiltration with response to immunotherapy in preclinical trials. Macrophage-targeted inhibition of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) by immunotherapy was confirmed to inhibit macrophage accumulation and slow mammary tumor growth in mouse models while also reducing hemosiderin iron-laden TAM accumulation as measured by both iron histology and in vivo iron MRI (FeMRI). Spatial profiling of TAM iron deposit infiltration defined regions of maximal accumulation and response to the CSF1R inhibitor, and revealed differences between microenvironments of human cancer according to levels of polarized macrophage iron accumulation in stromal margins. We therefore demonstrate that iron deposition serves as an endogenous metabolic imaging biomarker of TAM infiltration in breast cancer that has high translational potential for evaluation of immunotherapeutic response. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

The AP2 family also acts as a tumor suppressor. Here we found that p73 and AP2 are able to activate NEU4, a neuraminidase gene, which removes the terminal sialic acid residues from cancer-associated glycans. Under serum starvation, NEU4 was up-regulated and one of the NEU4 target glycans, sialyl Lewis X, was decreased, whereas p73 and AP2 were up-regulated. Sialyl Lewis X levels were not, however, decreased under starvation conditions in p73- or AP2-knockdown cells. p53 and AP2 underwent protein-protein interactions, exerting synergistic effects to activate p21, and interaction of p53 with AP2 was lost in cells expressing the L350P mutation of p53. The homologous residues in p63 and p73 are L423 and L377, respectively. The synergistic effect of p53/p63 with AP2 to activate genes was lost with the L350P/L423P mutation in p53/p63, but p73 bearing the L377P mutation was able to interact with AP2 and exerted its normal synergistic effects. We propose that p73 and AP2 synergistically activate the NEU4 promoter in colon cancer cells. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Treatment of C6 glioma cells with HspNPs for 24 and 48 h resulted in dose- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability, with approximate IC50 of 28 and 21 μg/mL, respectively (p = .036 for 24 h, p = .025 for 48 h). The percentage of PCNA positive cells decreased to 20% and 10%, respectively, for Hsp- and HspNP-treated cells at concentration of 100 µg/mL. Treatment with increasing concentrations of HspNPs (25, 50, 75 and 100 µg/mL) resulted in 9.1-, 7-, 12.5- and 12.7-fold in increase in apoptotic cell number. Optimum doses of Hsp and HspNPs were found to increase oxidative damage in C6 glioma cells. MDA levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were found to be significantly elevated at 75 and 100 µg/mL exposure concentration of HspNPs with (p = .002) and (p = .018), respectively for 48-h treatment.

GO exhibits pH-dependent fluorescence emission in the visible/near-infrared, providing a possibility of molecular imaging and pH-sensing. It is also water soluble and has a substantial platform for functionalization, allowing for the delivery of multiple therapeutics. GO physical properties are modified to enhance cellular internalization, producing fluorescent nanoflakes with low (<15%) cytotoxicity at the imaging concentrations of 15 μg/mL. As a result, at lower flake sizes GO rapidly internalizes into HeLa cells with the following 70% fluorescence based clearance at 24 h, assessed by its characteristic emission in red/near-IR. pH-dependence of GO emission is utilized to provide the sensing of acidic extracellular environments of cancer cells. The results demonstrate diminishing green/red (550/630 nm) fluorescence intensity ratios for HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells in comparison to HEK-293 healthy cells suggesting a potential use of GO as a non-invasive optical sensor for cancer microenvironments.

A total of 19,785 newly diagnosed CC patients were registered during 2010–2016, among them only 16,946 (85.6%) with primary CC tumor. There was no difference in treatment modality between DM and non-DM patients. However intergroup assessment showed that type 2DM have significantly higher rate of mortality in both overall mortality (28.3%) and CC-specific (11.7%) as compared to Type 1DM (17.3%; 5.5%) and non DM patients (12.7%; 9.1%) (p < 0.001). Within group assessments showed that Type 2DM patients have better quality of life (mean 7.13 ± 3.67) (p < 0.001) and less distress levels (mean 2.41 ± 0.63) (p < 0.011) as compared to type1 DM (meant 10.54 ± 2.11; 3.19 ± 1.07). This study concluded that T2DM prognostic effect still remained after adjusting demographic and clinical parameters. Type 1 diabetes mellitus showed better OS and CSS then type2 DM. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Despite the widening range of high-throughput platforms and exponential growth of generated data volume, the validation of biomarkers discovered from large-scale data remains a challenging field. In order to tackle cancer heterogeneity and comply with the data dimensionality, a number of network and pathway approaches were invented but rarely systematically applied to this task. We propose a new method, called NEAmarker, for finding sensitive and robust biomarkers at the pathway level. scores from network enrichment analysis transform the original space of altered genes into a lower-dimensional space of pathways. These dimensions are then correlated with phenotype variables. The method was first tested using in vitro data from three anti-cancer drug screens and then on clinical data of The Cancer Genome Atlas. It proved superior to the single-gene and alternative enrichment analyses in terms of (1) universal applicability to different data types with a possibility of cross-platform integration, (2) consistency of the discovered correlates between independent drug screens, and (3) ability to explain differential survival of treated patients. Our new screen of anti-cancer compounds validated the performance of multivariate models of drug sensitivity. The previously proposed methods of enrichment analysis could achieve comparable levels of performance in certain tests. However, only our method could discover predictors of both in vitro response and patient survival given administration of the same drug. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

SPIONs entrapped in the core of the nanocomplex may act as a hyperthermia agent and generate localized heat upon excitation with an alternating magnetic field (AMF), thus enabling a thermo-chemotherapy strategy for cancer treatment. Accordingly, the cytotoxic effect and the mode of cell death triggered by the nanocomplex in combination with AMF were evaluated on two different cancer cell lines with various folate receptor (FR) expression levels, including KB nasopharyngeal cancer cells overexpressing FRs as the model and MCF-7 breast cancer cells with low level of FRs as the blank sample. The obtained results showed that KB cell death was greater than the cell death observed in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, a majority of cell death in both cell lines were related to apoptosis when the folate-modified nanocomplex was used instated of the non-folate-modified nanocomplex. Therefore, functionalizing the nanocomplex with folate modulated the response to thermo-chemotherapy by shifting the cell death pathways toward apoptosis." ;

We examined TILs grades of pretreatment cancer tissue specimens and residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab and determined the predictive utility of the TILs grade in pathological complete response (pCR) and the prognostic power of TILs in HER2-positive breast cancer. This cohort study included 128 HER2-positive breast cancer who received NAC with trastuzumab. TILs grading of the tumor stroma in pretreatment biopsy specimens and residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab was categorized as low, intermediate, and high based on the criteria of the International Working Group. In current study, the pCR rate was 64.8%, and the Relapse-free survival (RFS) was significantly worse in the non-pCR group than in the pCR group. The pCR rate correlated with the TILs grade in pretreatment tumors. In 45 non-pCR patients, TILs grade was higher in the residual tumors than in the pretreatment tumors. The RFS was significantly better in residual tumors with high TILs grade than those with low TILs grade (p = 0.033). In conclusion, assessment of the TILs grade in residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab might be necessary to determine patients with good prognosis among those who do not achieve pCR. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

However, their clinical importance in gallbladder cancer has rarely been explored. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of surgical intervention and the effectiveness of preoperative test on neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) for predicting the prognosis in gallbladder cancer patients. In this study, a total of 255 gallbladder cancer patients were retrospectively selected. For each patient, we recorded his/her treatment algorithm (with or without surgery) and their preoperative inflammatory biomarkers, as well as their detailed survival information for 5 years. A total of 216 patients received surgical intervention and the other 39 chose conservative treatment. The median survival time was 4.6 months for non-surgical group (P < 0.001), and 12.2 months for surgical intervention group. Among the surgical group, ROC analysis showed the AUC of NLR, PLR and MLR were 0.675 (95% CI: 0.600 to 0.751, P < 0.001), 0.599 (95% CI: 0.520 to 0.677, P = 0.017) and 0.607 (95% CI: 0.529 to 0.686, P = 0.009), respectively. In conclusion, surgical intervention did improve the overall survival, and elevated NLR and MLR before surgery are associated with shorter OS of GBC patients. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Most targeting strategies of anticancer drug delivery systems (DDSs) rely on the surface functionalization of nanocarriers with specific ligands, which trigger the internalization in cancer cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The endocytosis implies the entrapment of DDSs in acidic vesicles (endosomes and lysosomes) and their eventual ejection by exocytosis. This process, intrinsic to eukaryotic cells, is one of the main drawbacks of DDSs because it reduces the drug bioavailability in the intracellular environment. The escape of DDSs from the acidic vesicles is, therefore, crucial to enhance the therapeutic performance at low drug dose. To this end, we developed a multifunctionalized DDS that combines high specificity towards cancer cells with endosomal escape capabilities. Doxorubicin-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles were functionalized with polyethylenimine, a polymer commonly used to induce endosomal rupture, and hyaluronic acid, which binds to CD44 receptors, overexpressed in cancer cells. We show irrefutable proof that the developed DDS can escape the endosomal pathway upon polymeric functionalization. Interestingly, the combination of the two polymers resulted in higher endosomal escape efficiency than the polyethylenimine coating alone. Hyaluronic acid additionally provides the system with cancer targeting capability and enzymatically controlled drug release. Thanks to this multifunctionality, the engineered DDS had cytotoxicity comparable to the pure drug whilst displaying high specificity towards cancer cells. The polymeric engineering here developed enhances the performance of DDS at low drug dose, holding great potential for anticancer therapeutic applications. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Using multiple aggressive murine models of triple-negative breast cancer, we have recently demonstrated that the early administration of oncolytic Maraba virus (MRB) prior to surgical resection of the primary tumor is sufficient to minimize the metastatic burden, protect against tumor rechallenge, cure a fraction of the mice and sensitize refractory tumors to immune checkpoint blockade without the need for further treatment. Here, we apply our surgical model to other OVs: Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Adenovirus (Ad), Reovirus (Reo) and Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and show that all of the tested OVs could positively change the outcome of the treated animals. The growth of the primary and secondary tumors was differently affected by the various OVs and most of the viruses conferred survival benefits in this neoadjuvant setting despite the absence of direct treatment following rechallenge. This study establishes that OV-therapy confers long-term protection when administered in the pre-operative window of opportunity. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Recent data indicate that p130Cas association to ErbB2 protects ErbB2 from degradation, thus enhancing tumorigenesis. Therefore, inhibiting p130Cas/ErbB2 interaction might represent a new therapeutic strategy to target breast cancer. Here we demonstrate by performing Molecular Modeling, Molecular Dynamics, dot blot, ELISA and fluorescence quenching experiments, that p130Cas binds directly to ErbB2. Then, by structure-based virtual screening, we identified two potential inhibitors of p130Cas/ErbB2 interaction. Their experimental validation was performed in vitro and in ErbB2-positive breast cancer cellular models. The results highlight that both compounds interfere with p130Cas/ErbB2 binding and significantly affect cell proliferation and sensitivity to Trastuzumab.

A large number of clinical applications have revealed that Trametes robiniophila Μurr. (Huaier) exhibits an anti-tumour effect. However, loss of the bioactive components of Huaier during the extraction procedure with water is unavoidable, and the underlying mechanism of the anti-cancer effect of Huaier remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer effect of Huaier n-butanol extract, which contained 51.4% total flavonoids, on HGC27, MGC803, and AGS human GC cell lines in vitro. At a low concentration, Huaier n-butanol extract inhibited the growth of these GC cell types, induced cell cycle arrest and reduced cell metastasis. Moreover, Huaier n-butanol extract suppressed the c-Myc-Bmi1 signalling pathway, and overexpression of Bmi1 reversed the effects of Huaier n-butanol extract on GC cells. Thus, our findings indicate that Huaier n-butanol extract suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of GC cells via a c-Myc-Bmi1-mediated approach, providing a new perspective for our understanding of the anti-tumour effects of Huaier. These results suggest that Huaier n-butanol extract could be an attractive therapeutic adjuvant for the treatment of human GC. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

In the present study, we screened the anticancer potential of supernatant metabolites from eight native haloarchaeal strains obtained from a culture collection in Iran. Five human cancer cell lines including breast, lung, prostate and also human fibroblast cells as the normal control were used in the present study. Moreover, to evaluate the anti-tumor effect of the selected supernatant, inhibition of sphere formation and tumor development was assessed in-vitro and in-vivo, respectively. Among all strains, supernatant metabolites from Halobacterium salinarum IBRC M10715 had the most potent cytotoxic effect on prostate cancer cell lines (IC50 = 0.5 mg/mL) without any effects on normal cells. It significantly increased both early and late apoptosis (about 11% and 9%, respectively) in the androgen-dependent PC3 cell line, reduced sphere formation ability of DU145 and PC3 cells with down-regulation of SOX2 gene expression. Furthermore, our results revealed that tumors developed in nude mice significantly shrank post intratumor injection of metabolites of the haloarchaeal strain. In conclusion, we suggested here for the first time that supernatant metabolites from Halobacterium salinarum IBRC M10715 could be a novel component against prostate cancer in-vitro and in-vivo with remarkable reduction in stem-like properties of tumor. © 2017, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

The main HNSCC risk factors are tobacco, excessive alcohol use, and the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV positive (+) cancers are etiologically different from other HNSCC and often show better prognosis. The current knowledge regarding HNSCC miRNA profiles is still incomplete especially in the context of HPV+ cancer. Thus, we analyzed 61 freshly collected primary oral (OSCC) and oropharyngeal (OPSCC) SCC samples. HPV DNA and RNA was found in 21% cases. The Illumina whole-genome small-RNA profiling by next-generation sequencing was done on 22 samples and revealed 7 specific miRNAs to HPV+ OSCC, 77 to HPV+ OPSCC, and additional 3 shared with both; 51 miRNAs were specific to HPV− OPSCC, 62 to HPV− OSCC, and 31 shared with both. The results for 9 miRNAs (miR-9, -21, -29a, -100, -106b, -143 and -145) were assessed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction on the whole study population. The data was additionally confirmed by reanalyzing publicly available miRNA sequencing Cancer Genome Atlas consortium (TCGA) HNSCC data. Cell signaling pathway analysis revealed differences between HPV+ and HPV− HNSCC. Our findings compared with literature data revealed extensive heterogeneity of miRNA deregulation with only several miRNAs consistently affected, and miR-9 being the most likely HPV related miRNA. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Resistance to 5-Fluorouracil chemotherapy is a major cause of therapeutic failure in colon cancer cure. Development of combined therapies constitutes an effective strategy to inhibit cancer cells and prevent the emergence of drug resistance. For this purpose, we investigated the anti-tumoral effect of thirteen phenolic compounds, from the Tunisian quince Cydonia oblonga Miller, alone or combined to 5-FU, on the human 5-FU-resistant LS174-R colon cancer cells in comparison to parental cells. Our results showed that only Kaempferol was able to chemo-sensitize 5-FU-resistant LS174-R cells. This phenolic compound combined with 5-FU exerted synergistic inhibitory effect on cell viability. This combination enhanced the apoptosis and induced cell cycle arrest of both chemo-resistant and sensitive cells through impacting the expression levels of different cellular effectors. Kaempferol also blocked the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and modulated the expression of JAK/STAT3, MAPK, PI3K/AKT and NF-κB. In silico docking analysis suggested that the potent anti-tumoral effect of Kaempferol, compared to its two analogs (Kaempferol 3-O-glucoside and Kampferol 3-O-rutinoside), can be explained by the absence of glucosyl groups. Overall, our data propose Kaempferol as a potential chemotherapeutic agent to be used alone or in combination with 5-FU to overcome colon cancer drug resistance. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Considering the high prevalence and mortality rate of colorectal cancer, in this study we tried to design and validate a standard printed form and evaluate oncologists’ and nurses’ adherence to this form. This cross-sectional study was performed in Omid hospital, Mashhad, Iran from January 2015 to October 2015. A Chemotherapy form including various demographic and clinical parameters and approved chemotherapy regimens for colorectal cancer was designed by the clinical pharmacist and validated by clinical oncologists working in this center. All eligible patients admitted in this center during this period of time were included in the study. Adherence of the oncologists and nurses to this form and probable medication errors were identified by the pharmacy student. Sixty-seven patients with colorectal cancer and a total of 251 chemotherapy courses were evaluated. All patients received regimens compatible with developed form but in 206 courses (98.56%) of chemotherapy dosing error happened and in most of cases patients received lower than calculated dose (37.8%). Three errors occurred in administration step by nurses which they infused the medication in shorter than recommended duration. In general, oncologists’ adherence with developed form for chemotherapy of colorectal cancer was relatively high, except in dose calculation. Avoiding from rounding the calculated medications’ doses and precise calculation of patients’ body surface area can prevent most of medication errors and reduce risk of adverse drug reaction occurrence. © 2017, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

Nevertheless, the importance of transfusion timing is still unclear. The primary purpose of this study is to appraise whether the receipt of intraoperative blood transfusion (BT) differ from postoperative BT in regards to cancer outcomes in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients treated with nephrectomy. Data on 1168 patients with RCC, who underwent radical or partial nephrectomy as primary therapy between 1988–2013 were analyzed. PBT was defined as transfusion of allogeneic red blood cells (RBC) during surgery or the postsurgical period. Survival was analyzed and compared using the Kaplan–Meier method with the log-rank test. Of 1168 patients, 198 patients (16.9%) received a PBT. Including 117 intraoperative BT and 81 postoperative BT. Only 21 (10.6%) patients required both intraoperative and postoperative BT. On multivariate analyses, receipt of PBT was associated with significantly worse local disease recurrence (HR: 2.4; P = 0.017), metastatic progression (HR: 2.7; P = 0.005), cancer-specific mortality (HR: 3.5; P = 0.002) and all-cause mortality (HR: 2.1; P = 0.005). Nevertheless, postoperative BT was not independently associated with increased risk of local recurrence (p = 0.1), metastatic progression (P = 0.16) or kidney cancer death (P = 0.63), yet did significantly increase the risk of overall mortality (HR: 2.6; P = 0.004). In the current study, intraoperative transfusion of allogeneic RBC is associated with increased risks of cancer recurrence and mortality following nephrectomy. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

For this reason novel therapies accounting for PDAC peculiarities, such as the relevant stromal reaction, are urgently needed. Here adipose mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (AD-MSC) have been armed to constantly release a soluble trimeric and multimeric variant of the known anti-cancer TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (sTRAIL). This cancer gene therapy strategy was in vitro challenged demonstrating that sTRAIL was thermally stable and able to induce apoptosis in the PDAC lines BxPC-3, MIA PaCa-2 and against primary PDAC cells. sTRAIL released by AD-MSC relocated into the tumor stroma was able to significantly counteract tumor growth in vivo with a significant reduction in tumor size, in cytokeratin-7+ cells and by an anti-angiogenic effect. In parallel, histology on PDAC specimens form patients (n = 19) was performed to investigate the levels of TRAIL DR4, DR5 and OPG receptors generating promising insights on the possible clinical translation of our approach. These results indicate that adipose MSC can very efficiently vehicle a novel TRAIL variant opening unexplored opportunities for PDAC treatment. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Therefore, identification of novel therapeutic targets involved in melanoma progression is urgently needed for developing effective therapeutic methods. Overexpression of interleukin-13 receptor α2 (IL13Rα2) is observed in several cancer types including glioma and pancreatic cancer. Although IL13Rα2 is implicated in the progression of various types of cancer, its expression and roles in the malignant melanoma have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we showed that IL13Rα2 was expressed in approximately 7.5% melanoma patients. While IL13Rα2 expression in human melanoma cells decreased their proliferation in vitro, it promoted in vivo tumour growth and angiogenesis in melanoma xenograft mouse model. We also found that the expression of amphiregulin, a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, was correlated with IL13Rα2 expression in cultured melanoma cells, xenograft tumour tissues and melanoma clinical samples. Furthermore, expression of amphiregulin promoted tumour growth, implicating causal relationship between the expression of IL13Rα2 and amphiregulin. These results suggest that IL13Rα2 enhances tumorigenicity by inducing angiogenesis in malignant melanoma, and serves as a potential therapeutic target of malignant melanoma. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Experiment in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines demonstrated up-regulation of PKD2 led to high expression of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vim, mmp9 et al.) and EMT transcription factors(zeb1, twist, snail), and the results were reversed when PKD2 was knocked down. Further investigation showed that abrogation of PKD2 inhibited A549 cell migration, invasion, proliferation and induced cell arrest in G2/M phase.

We showed for the first time that Raman imaging can be used to distinguish successfully between glycosylated and nonglycosylated proteins in normal and cancer tissue. Thousands of protein, lipid and glycan species exist in cells and tissues and their metabolism is monitored via numerous pathways, networks and methods. The metabolism can change in response to cellular environment alterations, such as development of a disease. Measuring such alterations and understanding the pathways involved are crucial to fully understand cellular metabolism in cancer development. In this paper Raman markers of glycogen, glycosaminoglycan, chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate proteoglycan were identified based on their vibrational signatures. High spatial resolution of Raman imaging combined with chemometrics allows separation of individual species from many chemical components present in each cell. We have found that metabolism of proteins, lipids and glycans is markedly deregulated in breast (adenocarcinoma) and brain (medulloblastoma) tumors. We have identified two glycoforms in the normal breast tissue and the malignant brain tissue in contrast to the breast cancer tissue where only one glycoform has been identified. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate anti-cancer effects of NLC-Citral in MDA MB-231 cells in vitro through the Annexin V, cell cycle, JC-1 and fluorometric assays. Additionally, this study is aimed to effects of NLC-Citral in reducing the tumor weight and size in 4T1 induced murine breast cancer model. Results showed that NLC-Citral induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest in MDA MB-231 cells. Furthermore, a prominent anti-metastatic ability of NLC-Citral was demonstrated in vitro using scratch, migration and invasion assays. A significant reduction of migrated and invaded cells was observed in the NLC-Citral treated MDA MB-231 cells. To further evaluate the apoptotic and anti-metastatic mechanism of NLC-Citral at the molecular level, microarray-based gene expression and proteomic profiling were conducted. Based on the result obtained, NLC-Citral was found to regulate several important signaling pathways related to cancer development such as apoptosis, cell cycle, and metastasis signaling pathways. Additionally, gene expression analysis was validated through the targeted RNA sequencing and real-time polymerase chain reaction. In conclusion, the NLC-Citral inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells in vitro, majorly through the induction of apoptosis, anti-metastasis, anti-angiogenesis potentials, and reducing the tumor weight and size without altering the therapeutic effects of citral. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The incidence of developing cancer should increase with the body mass, yet is not the case, a conundrum referred to as Peto’s paradox. Elephants have a lower incidence of cancer suggesting that these animals have probably evolved different ways to protect themselves against the disease. The paradox is worth revisiting with the realization that most mammals encode an endogenous APOBEC3 cytidine deaminase capable of mutating single stranded DNA. Indeed, the mutagenic activity of some APOBEC3 enzymes has been shown to introduce somatic mutations into genomic DNA. These enzymes are now recognized as causal agent responsible for the accumulation of CG- > TA transitions and DNA breaks leading to chromosomal rearrangements in human cancer genomes. Here, we identified an elephant A3Z1 gene, related to human APOBEC3A and showed that it could efficiently deaminate cytidine, 5-methylcytidine and produce DNA breaks leading to massive apoptosis, similar to other mammalian APOBEC3A enzymes where body mass varies by up to four orders of magnitude. Consequently, it could be considered that eAZ1 might contribute to cancer in elephants in a manner similar to their proposed role in humans. If so, eAZ1 might be particularly well regulated to counter Peto’s paradox. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "The incidasdsence of developing cancer should increase with the body mass, yet is not the case, a conundrum referred to as Peto’s paradox. Elephants have a lower incidence of cancer suggesting that these animals have probably evolved different ways to protect themselves against the disease. The paradox is worth revisiting with the realization that most mammals encode an endogenous APOBEC3 cytidine deaminase capable of mutating single stranded DNA. Indeed, the mutagenic activity of some APOBEC3 enzymes has been shown to introduce somatic mutations into genomic DNA. These enzymes are now recognized as causal agent responsible for the accumulation of CG- > TA transitions and DNA breaks leading to chromosomal rearrangements in human cancer genomes. Here, we identified an elephant A3Z1 gene, related to human APOBEC3A and showed that it could efficiently deaminate cytidine, 5-methylcytidine and produce DNA breaks leading to massive apoptosis, similar to other mammalian APOBEC3A enzymes where body mass varies by up to four orders of magnitude. Consequently, it could be considered that eAZ1 might contribute to cancer in elephants in a manner similar to their proposed role in humans. If so, eAZ1 might be particularly well regulated to counter Peto’s paradox. © 2017, The Author(s)." ;

        fabio:abstract    "Despite recent improvements in treatment, ovarian cancer is still the leading cause of death from gynaecological malignancies. Today, marine mollusks are considered as natural source of new biologically and pharmacologically active compounds by scientists and the pharmaceutical industries. The aim of this study is to investigate the selective apoptotic effects of Turbo coronatus crude extract fractions on human epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells and mitochondria. The cells and mitochondria were isolated from cancerous and non-cancerous ovarian tissues and exposed to IC 50 concentration of F1 fraction for evaluation of mitochondrial and cellular parameters. Our results showed that F1 fraction of T. coronatus crude extract significantly induced toxic effects only in the cancerous ovarian mitochondria, including increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, mitochondrial swelling, and cytochrome c release.Flow-cytometry analysis demonstrated that F1 fraction of T. coronatus progressively induced apoptosis and necrosis only on EOC but not non-cancerous cells. We eventuallyconcluded that F1 fraction of T. coronatus crude extract selectively induces apoptosis in EOC through a ROS-mediated pathway. © 2017, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.
